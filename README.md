# LLMs-Play-Textual-Games

Repository for the code related to my MSc thesis project.

The project explores the capabilities of RLMs playing textual games, and tentatively defines a game-agnostic framework for exploiting the advantages of reasoning and CoT prompting while avoiding some of the associated pitfalls and disadvantages.
