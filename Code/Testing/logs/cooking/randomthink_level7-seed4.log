You are in a kitchen. A standard kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

You can make out a fridge. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You can see an oven. Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a raw yellow potato, a red hot pepper, a yellow apple, a banana, a red bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a yellow onion, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato and a knife. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.

There is a closed plain door leading south. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe in the cookbook. The recipe requires three ingredients: red hot pepper, white tuna, and yellow potato. The directions mention chopping and roasting them.

First, I need to check what items are available in the kitchen. The user mentioned there's a raw yellow potato, a red hot pepper, a yellow apple, a banana, a red bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a yellow onion, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, and a knife. Wait, the ingredients needed are red hot pepper, white tuna, and yellow potato. But the available items don't include white tuna. Hmm, that's a problem. The user might have missed that. But maybe "white tuna" is a typo or a specific item they have? Let me check again. The items listed are raw yellow potato, red hot pepper, yellow apple, banana, red bell pepper, yellow bell pepper, yellow onion, raw purple potato, raw red potato, and a knife. There's no mention of white tuna. So maybe the user needs to find a substitute or there's an error in the recipe. But since the game is text-based, perhaps the user is supposed to proceed with the available items. Alternatively, maybe "white tuna" is a red herring, and the user should proceed with the available ingredients. 

Wait, the recipe says "white tuna" but the user doesn't have that. So maybe the user needs to look for it. But in the kitchen description, there's no white tuna listed. The user might have to check other locations, but the current room is the kitchen, and the exit is east. However, the user can't go east because there's no door. The only exit is south. But the user is in the kitchen, so maybe they can't go anywhere else. So perhaps the user is stuck because they can't find white tuna. But the user is supposed to follow the recipe. Maybe the user needs to check the fridge or oven for the white tuna. Wait, the fridge is mentioned as being in the kitchen. The user hasn't checked the fridge yet. So the next step would be to open the fridge to see if white tuna is there. But the user hasn't done that yet. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to proceed despite the missing ingredient. But the recipe requires all three. So the user needs to find white tuna. Let me check the initial description again. The user is in the kitchen, and the items in the room are the ones listed. The fridge is in the kitchen, but the user hasn't checked it. So the next action should be to open the fridge to look for white tuna. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the user's next action should be to open the fridge. However, the user's previous actions were trying to open the cookbook, which wasn't possible, then looking around, then looking at the cookbook. Now, after reading the recipe, the user needs to proceed. The user is at the kitchen, and the fridge is in the kitchen. So the next step is to open the fridge to check if white tuna is there. If not, then maybe the user has to find another way, but according to the game's setup, the user might have to proceed with the available items. But the recipe requires white tuna, which is missing. So perhaps the user is supposed to look in the fridge. Therefore, the next action should be to open the fridge.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the recipe from the cookbook. The recipe requires red hot pepper, white tuna, and yellow potato. So far, they've taken the white tuna and the red hot pepper. The next ingredient needed is the yellow potato. Let me check where the yellow potato is.

In the kitchen, the user mentioned there's a raw yellow potato on the counter. So the next step should be to take the yellow potato. Once they have all three ingredients, they need to follow the directions: chop the red hot pepper, fry it, chop the white tuna, roast the tuna, chop and roast the yellow potato, then prepare the meal. 

The user has already collected two of the three ingredients. The missing one is the yellow potato. So the correct next action is to take the yellow potato from the counter. That would complete the ingredients needed for the recipe. Then they can proceed with the cooking steps as per the directions.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the recipe from the cookbook. So far, they've taken the white tuna, red hot pepper, and yellow potato. The next step in the recipe is to chop the red hot pepper. But when they tried to chop it, they were asked to specify which tool to use. The user tried "use knife", but the system said they can't see any such thing. Wait, maybe the knife isn't in the right place or not available.

Looking back at the kitchen items: the user mentioned there's a knife on the counter. Wait, in the initial description, the counter has a knife. So maybe the knife is there. But when the user tried to use it, it didn't work. Maybe the knife isn't equipped yet. So the correct action would be to take the knife first, then use it to chop the pepper. But the user hasn't taken the knife yet. So the next step should be to take the knife from the counter, then use it to chop the red hot pepper. But the user's last action was "chop red hot pepper", which required using the knife. Since the system said "can't see any such thing", maybe the knife isn't in the inventory. So the user needs to take the knife first. Therefore, the next action should be "take knife" to get it, then use it to chop the pepper. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the correct next step is to take the knife.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the recipe from the cookbook. So far, they've gathered the white tuna, red hot pepper, and yellow potato. They also took the knife. The next step in the recipe is to chop the red hot pepper. But they tried to chop it and got an error about not having the right tool. Wait, they just took the knife, so maybe they need to use it now.

Wait, the previous action was trying to chop the red hot pepper, but the system said they couldn't see any such thing. Maybe the knife isn't in the right place. Let me check the inventory. The user took the knife from the counter, so it should be with them now. So the next step is to use the knife to chop the red hot pepper. The command should be "chop red hot pepper with knife" or something similar. But in the game's syntax, maybe it's just "chop red hot pepper" since the knife is already taken. But the system said "can't see any such thing" when they tried to chop it. Maybe they need to use the knife first. Wait, the user just took the knife, so maybe they need to use it now. So the correct command would be "use knife on red hot pepper" or "chop red hot pepper with knife". But the game might expect "chop red hot pepper" since the knife is in hand. Let me think. The previous error was when they tried to chop without the knife. But they just took the knife, so now they can chop. So the next action should be "chop red hot pepper".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the recipe from the cookbook. So far, they've gathered the red hot pepper, white tuna, and yellow potato. They also took the knife and chopped the red hot pepper. The next step in the recipe is to fry the red hot pepper. Since they have the knife, maybe they need to use it to fry it? Wait, but the knife is for chopping, not frying. Oh, right, the recipe says "chop the red hot pepper" which they did, then "fry the red hot pepper". So after chopping, they need to fry it. But how? They have a stove, but the stove is empty. Maybe they need to put the chopped pepper on the stove and turn it on? But the game might require specific commands. The user has the knife, but frying might require using the stove. So the next action should be to fry the red hot pepper. But the user has to use the correct command. The previous action was chopping, so now they need to fry it. The command would be "fry red hot pepper". Let me check the previous steps. The user has the red hot pepper, so they can fry it. The next step is to fry it. So the answer should be "fry red hot pepper".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the recipe from the cookbook. So far, they've gathered the red hot pepper, white tuna, and yellow potato. They also took the knife and chopped the red hot pepper. Now, the next step in the recipe is to "fry the red hot pepper." But the user tried "fry red hot pepper" and got an error. Then they tried "fry red hot pepper with pan" which also didn't work.

Hmm, maybe the game expects a specific command structure. The recipe says "chop the red hot pepper" and "fry the red hot pepper." Since the user already chopped it, the next step is frying. But the game might require using the stove or a pan. The user has a stove in the kitchen, but there's no pan mentioned. Wait, the user has a knife, but frying usually requires a pan. Maybe they need to use the stove directly.

Alternatively, maybe the correct command is just "fry red hot pepper" without specifying the pan, assuming the stove is the cooking appliance. The error might be because "fry" isn't a recognized verb here. Maybe the correct verb is "cook" or "heat." But the recipe says "fry," so perhaps the game expects that exact term.

Wait, the user tried "fry red hot pepper with pan" and it didn't work. Maybe the correct command is "fry red hot pepper" without the pan. Or maybe the stove is the correct object. Let me check the environment again. The user is in the kitchen with a stove, but no pan. So maybe the stove is the tool. So the command should be "fry red hot pepper with stove." But the game might not recognize that. Alternatively, maybe the correct action is just "fry red hot pepper," and the error is a mistake in the game's response. But the user got "That's not a verb I recognise." So maybe "fry" isn't the right verb. Maybe the correct verb is "cook" or "heat."

Alternatively, perhaps the user needs to use the stove first. So the steps could be: go to the stove, then fry. But the user is already in the kitchen. Maybe the correct command is "use stove to fry red hot pepper." But the game might not accept that. Alternatively, the user might need to "heat" the red hot pepper. But the recipe says "fry," so maybe the game is expecting that exact command. Maybe the error is a false positive, and the correct action is indeed "fry red hot pepper." The user should try that again.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the recipe from the cookbook. The recipe says to "fry the red hot pepper" after chopping it. The user has already chopped the red hot pepper using the knife. Now, they need to fry it.

But in the game, the available actions are limited. The user tried "fry red hot pepper" but got an error. Then they tried "fry red hot pepper with pan" and "fry red hot pepper in pan", but the game didn't recognize those. The problem might be that the game expects a specific verb or command structure. 

Looking back at the recipe directions: "chop the red hot pepper", "fry the red hot pepper". The game might require the exact phrase "fry" followed by the object. However, the user tried "fry red hot pepper" and it didn't work. Maybe the game requires using the stove or a pan. But the user hasn't used the stove yet. The stove is in the kitchen, but there's nothing on it. 

Wait, the user has a knife, which they used to chop. Now, to fry, they might need to use the stove. But the game might not have a "use stove" command. Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "fry" without specifying the pan, but the game doesn't recognize it. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "put the red hot pepper in the pan" and then "fry". But the user hasn't picked up the pan. The game's inventory includes the knife, the white tuna, red hot pepper, yellow potato. The pan isn't mentioned as being in the kitchen. The stove is there, but no pan. 

Wait, the user is in the kitchen, and the stove is present. Maybe the correct action is to "fry the red hot pepper on the stove". But the game might not recognize "on the stove". Alternatively, the user might need to "fry" the pepper, and the game just expects the verb "fry" with the object. 

But the user tried "fry red hot pepper" and it didn't work. The game says "That's not a verb I recognise." So maybe the correct command is "fry" followed by the object, but the game is expecting a different structure. Maybe "fry the red hot pepper" is the correct command, but the user is missing the article "the". 

Wait, in the previous steps, the user said "chop the red hot pepper" and it worked. So maybe the correct command is "fry the red hot pepper". But the user tried "fry red hot pepper" without "the" and it didn't work. So perhaps the correct command is "fry the red hot pepper". 

But the user's last attempt was "fry red hot pepper" again, and the game still didn't recognize it. So maybe the game is expecting a different verb, like "cook" or "sear". Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the stove first. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "put the red hot pepper in the pan" and then "fry". But the pan isn't in the kitchen. The user has a knife, but no pan. The stove is there, but no pan. 

Hmm, the user is stuck here. The recipe says to fry the red hot pepper after chopping. The user has the red hot pepper and the knife. The next step is to fry it. The game might require the exact command "fry the red hot pepper", but the user is missing the article "the". 

So the correct command would be "fry the red hot pepper". Let me check the previous steps. The user tried "fry red hot pepper" and it didn't work. So adding "the" might be necessary. 

Therefore, the next action should be "fry the red hot pepper".
