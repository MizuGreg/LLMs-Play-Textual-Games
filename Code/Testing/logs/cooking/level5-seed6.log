You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Bathroom =-
You arrive in a bathroom. A normal kind of place. You begin looking for stuff.

You see a toilet. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the toilet! oh well.

There is an exit to the west.

-= Corridor =-
You arrive in a corridor. An usual one.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.

-= Kitchen =-
Look around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You make out an opened fridge. The fridge is empty! What a waste of a day! You can make out a closed oven. You can see a table. Now why would someone leave that there? The table is massive. On the table you can see a knife. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a yellow apple, a red apple, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper and a cookbook. You make out a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is an open frosted-glass door leading east. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door. There is an exit to the west.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they need to cook a meal. The goal is to check the cookbook in the kitchen, take it, and then use it to make a meal. So far, they've gone from the bathroom to the corridor, then to the kitchen. In the kitchen, they found the cookbook on the counter and took it.

Now, the next step would be to use the cookbook. Since the cookbook is in hand, the next logical action is to open it to find the recipe. The user needs to read the recipe to know how to cook the ingredients they have. The ingredients mentioned are apples, an onion, a bell pepper, and maybe others. The oven is closed, so they might need to use it once they have the recipe.

But the current location is the kitchen, and the user has the cookbook. The possible actions here would be to open the cookbook, check the recipes, or look for other items. Since the cookbook is the key here, opening it makes sense. The user should open the cookbook to proceed with the recipe. The next action should be "open cookbook" to access the recipe and then follow the steps to cook the meal.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe in the cookbook. So far, they've taken the cookbook, looked at it, and found the ingredients needed: two apples (red and yellow) and a knife. They've already taken the knife from the table. The next step in the recipe is to chop the red apple.

But wait, the user tried to "chop red apple" earlier, and the game responded that cutting something requires a knife. Then they took the knife. Now, they need to use the knife to chop the red apple. Since they've already taken the knife, the next logical step is to chop the red apple with the knife. The command should be "chop red apple" again, but this time they have the knife. Let me check the previous steps again.

Yes, the user took the knife from the table. So now, they can use the knife to chop the red apple. The game might require the command "chop red apple" again. The previous attempt failed because the knife wasn't taken yet, but now it's in their inventory. So the correct next action is to chop the red apple with the knife. The answer should be "chop red apple".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the recipe from the cookbook. The recipe says to chop the red apple and fry it. But the user tried to chop the red apple directly and got an error because they need the knife. Then they took the knife, but then tried to chop the red apple again with the knife, but the system said they need to take the red apple first.

Wait, so the problem is that the user hasn't picked up the red apple yet. The previous action was trying to chop the red apple with the knife, but the system says they need to take the red apple first. So the correct step would be to take the red apple from the counter. Then, use the knife to chop it. So the next action should be to take the red apple. Then, after that, chop it with the knife. But the user hasn't taken the apple yet. So the next command should be "take red apple".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the recipe from the cookbook. They've already taken the red apple and chopped it. Now they need to fry the red apple. The previous attempt to fry it resulted in an error because "fry" isn't a recognized verb here. Maybe the correct command is "cook" instead of "fry"? Or perhaps there's a specific action needed for frying. Since the recipe says "fry the red apple," but the game doesn't recognize "fry," maybe the user should use "cook" or check if the stove is available. Wait, the user is in the kitchen, and there's a stove mentioned. Maybe the correct action is "put the red apple on the stove" or "cook the red apple on the stove." Alternatively, maybe "fry" is a valid verb, but the game is expecting a different phrasing. Let me check the previous steps. The user had the knife, chopped the apple, so now they need to fry it. Since "fry" isn't working, perhaps the correct action is "cook" or "fry the red apple with the stove." But the game might require a specific command. The user might need to use "cook" instead. Alternatively, maybe they need to use the stove first. Wait, the stove is in the kitchen. So maybe the correct action is "cook the red apple on the stove." But the user's last action was "fry red apple," which didn't work. So the next step should be to try "cook" instead. Let me think. The recipe says "fry," but the game might use "cook" as the verb. So the user should try "cook red apple" or "cook the red apple." Alternatively, maybe "fry" is correct, but there's a typo. But the user's previous attempt was "fry red apple," which didn't work. So perhaps the correct action is "cook red apple." Let me check the possible commands. The user has the knife, the red apple, and the stove is present. So the next step is to cook the apple. Therefore, the correct command would be "cook red apple."

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to fry the red apple. They've already chopped it. The next step would be to fry it. But in the game, they need to use a pan or some cooking appliance. The user tried "use stove" but got an error. Maybe the stove isn't the right tool here. The recipe says to fry the apple, so maybe they need a pan. But the user tried "use pan" and it wasn't recognized. Wait, maybe the correct action is to use the stove's cooking surface. Alternatively, maybe the game expects a different verb. Since the user has the knife and the apple, perhaps they need to put the apple in the stove. But the previous attempt to use the stove didn't work. Maybe the correct command is "put red apple on stove" or something similar. But the game might require a specific verb. Since the user is stuck, they need to figure out the right action. The previous error was "use stove" not being a verb. Maybe the correct action is "fry red apple with stove" or "cook red apple on stove". But the game might expect "put" or "place". Alternatively, maybe the stove is already available, so the user just needs to use it. But the user tried "use stove" and it didn't work. Maybe the correct command is "use the stove" with the apple. But the game might require a different approach. Since the user is following the recipe, the next step after chopping is frying. So the correct action is probably "fry red apple", but the game didn't recognize it. Maybe the user needs to use the stove first. Wait, the user has the knife and the apple. They need to put the apple on the stove. So the correct command might be "put red apple on stove". But the game might not accept that. Alternatively, maybe the stove is already in use, so the user can just fry it. But the game's response was that "use stove" isn't a verb. So maybe the correct action is "fry red apple with stove" or "cook red apple on stove". But the user tried "fry red apple" and it was invalid. The user is confused. The correct answer here is probably "put red apple on stove" or "place red apple on stove". But the game might have a specific command. Since the user is in the kitchen with a stove, the next step is to use the stove to fry the apple. So the correct action is "use stove" but the game says that's not a verb. Maybe the correct verb is "cook" or "fry". But the user tried "fry" and it didn't work. Maybe the correct command is "fry red apple with stove". But the game might not accept that.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to fry the red apple. They've already chopped it and put it on the stove. The problem is that the command "fry red apple" isn't working. The game is expecting a different verb or a different way to phrase it.

Looking back at the recipe, the directions say "fry the red apple" and "fry the yellow apple". But in the game, "fry" might not be an accepted verb here. Maybe the correct action is to use the stove or a pan. The user tried "use stove" but that wasn't recognized. Maybe they need to "cook" instead of "fry"? Or perhaps "sear"?

Alternatively, the game might require a specific verb like "heat" or "cook with". Since the user has the knife and the apple on the stove, maybe the next step is to "cook" the apple using the stove. The previous attempt was "fry", which didn't work. Trying "cook" might be the right verb here. Let me check the possible commands again. The user has the knife, the apple on the stove. The correct action might be "cook red apple with stove" but the game doesn't recognize "cook". Alternatively, "fry" might need a different phrasing. Maybe "fry the red apple" is correct, but the game is expecting "fry" without the article. Wait, the user tried "fry red apple" and it didn't work. Maybe the correct command is "fry the red apple"? But the game says "That's not a verb I recognise." So perhaps "fry" is not the right verb here. Maybe the correct action is to "heat" the apple on the stove. Or maybe "use" the stove to fry it. But the user tried "use stove" and it didn't work. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the correct verb is "cook" instead of "fry". Let me try "cook red apple with stove". But the game says "That's not a verb I recognise." So maybe the correct verb is "fry" but with the article. Wait, the user tried "fry red apple" and it didn't work. Maybe the correct command is "fry the red apple". But the game doesn't recognize "fry" as a verb. Maybe the game expects "cook" instead. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "put" the apple on the stove and then "heat" it. But the user already put it on the stove. Maybe the correct action is to "cook" the apple. Let me try "cook red apple".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to fry the red apple. They've taken the red apple and put it on the stove. But the game is saying "That's not a verb I recognise" when they try to fry it. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the correct action is to use the stove. The user tried "fry red apple" but that's not working. The previous steps showed that after chopping, they need to fry. But the game doesn't recognize "fry" as a verb here. Maybe they need to use the stove instead. But the user tried "use stove" and it didn't work. Oh, maybe the correct command is "cook" instead of "fry"? Or perhaps "heat" the apple on the stove. 

Looking back at the recipe, the directions say "fry the red apple". But in the game, the available actions might be different. The user has the knife, the red apple, and the stove. They need to use the stove to fry it. Maybe the correct command is "put red apple on stove" and then "heat" or "cook". But the user tried "fry" and it didn't work. Maybe the game expects "cook" instead. Or maybe they need to use the stove as an object. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the pan. Wait, the kitchen has a stove, but there's no pan mentioned. The user has a knife, apples, onion, etc. Maybe the stove is the cooking appliance here. So after putting the apple on the stove, the next step is to "cook" it. But the game says "That's not a verb I recognise." So perhaps the correct action is "cook red apple with stove". But the user tried that and it didn't work. 

Wait, the user tried "cook red apple" and the game said they need to take the apple first. But they already took it. Maybe the correct action is "use stove" on the apple. But the game says "That's not a verb I recognise." So maybe the correct command is "heat red apple with stove". But the user hasn't tried that. Alternatively, maybe the game expects "fry" to be used with the stove. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the stove as a tool. So after putting the apple on the stove, the next step is to "cook" it. But the game doesn't recognize "cook" as a verb. This is confusing. The user is stuck here. The next action should be to try using the stove to cook the apple, even if the verbs are different. Maybe "cook" is the correct verb here. Let me check the previous steps. The user tried "cook red apple" and the game said they need to take the apple first, but they already have it. So maybe the correct action is "cook red apple with stove". But the game says that's not a verb. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the stove to heat the apple. So "heat red apple with stove". But the game might not recognize that. Alternatively, maybe the correct action is "fry red apple" again, but the game says it's not a verb. Maybe the game is expecting a different command. The user is in a loop here. The correct next step is probably to try "cook" again, even though the game says it's not a verb. Or maybe "use stove" on the apple. But the game says that's not a verb. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the stove as a tool. So the correct command is "use stove on red apple". But the game might not recognize that. The user is stuck, so the next action should be to try "cook red apple" again, even though it's not working. Or maybe "heat red apple". But the game might not recognize that. 

Wait, the user tried "fry red apple" and it didn't work. The recipe says "fry the red apple", so maybe the correct action is "fry" but the game is not recognizing it. Maybe the user needs to use the stove to fry it. So the correct command is "fry red apple with stove". But the game says that's not a verb. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the stove to cook the apple. So "cook red apple with stove". But the game says that's not a verb. This is a problem. The user is stuck here. The correct next action is probably to try "cook" again, even though the game says it's not a verb. Or maybe the user needs to use the stove as an object. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the stove to heat the apple. So "heat red apple with stove". But the game might not recognize that. 

In the end, the user needs to proceed with the correct action, even if the game is not recognizing it. The next step is to try "cook red apple" again, even though the game says it's not a verb. Or maybe "fry" is the correct verb here, and the game is just not recognizing it. So the user should try "fry red apple" again.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to fry the red apple. They've tried using the stove and pan, but the game doesn't recognize those verbs. Maybe the correct action is to use the stove as a verb. Wait, the user previously tried "use stove" but it wasn't recognized. Alternatively, maybe the command should be "fry" followed by the object and the tool. But the game might expect a specific phrasing. Since the user is stuck, perhaps the next step is to try using the stove again, even though it didn't work before. Or maybe there's another way to cook the apple. Let me check the previous steps. The user has the knife, red apple, and is in the kitchen. The recipe says to fry the apple, so maybe the correct command is "fry red apple with stove" but the game doesn't accept that. Alternatively, maybe "cook red apple with stove" or "heat red apple on stove". But the game's response says "That's not a verb I recognise." So perhaps the correct verb is "fry" followed by the apple and the tool. But the user tried that. Maybe the correct command is "fry red apple" without the tool, but the game expects the tool. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the stove first. Wait, the user has the knife, but the stove is there. Maybe the correct action is to "use stove" to heat the apple. But the game says "That's not a verb I recognise." Hmm. Maybe the user needs to "put red apple on stove" and then "fry". But the user tried that. Alternatively, maybe the correct verb is "cook" instead of "fry". The recipe says "fry", but maybe the game uses "cook". Let me check the previous interactions. The user tried "cook red apple" but got an error. Maybe the correct command is "fry red apple with pan" but the game doesn't recognize it. This is confusing. The user is stuck, so maybe the next step is to try "fry red apple" again, even though it didn't work before. Or perhaps the user needs to use the stove as a tool. Maybe the correct command is "fry red apple using stove". But the game might not accept that. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "heat red apple on stove". But the game's response says "That's not a verb I recognise." So perhaps the correct action is to use the stove as a verb. Wait, the user tried "use stove" and it didn't work. Maybe the correct verb is "fry" followed by the apple and the tool. But the game doesn't recognize it. Maybe the user needs to "fry" the apple, and the tool is implied. But the game says "That's not a verb I recognise." So perhaps the correct action is to "fry red apple" without the tool, but the game doesn't accept it. The user is stuck here. The original goal is to cook a meal, so maybe the user needs to proceed with the steps even if the commands aren't working. Alternatively, maybe the user should try the yellow apple next. But the recipe says to chop and fry both. The user has the red apple done. Maybe the next step is to move to the next part of the recipe. But the user is stuck on frying the red apple. Maybe the correct command is "fry red apple" and the game will accept it despite the previous error. Let me try that.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to fry the red apple, but the game isn't recognizing "fry" as a verb. They've tried using "cook" and "use stove" but didn't work. Maybe the correct verb is "heat" or "cook"? Wait, in the recipe, the directions say "fry the red apple," but the game might expect a different command. Alternatively, maybe they need to use the stove properly. The user has the knife and the red apple. They took the red apple and put it on the stove. Maybe the next step is to use the stove to fry it. But the game says "That's not a verb I recognise." So perhaps the correct action is "heat" or "cook" with the stove. Alternatively, maybe "fry" is allowed but needs an object. Wait, the user tried "fry red apple with stove" but it didn't work. Maybe the correct command is just "fry red apple" but the game is expecting a different verb. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the stove first. Wait, the stove is already there. Maybe the correct action is "heat red apple on stove." But the game might not recognize that. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the pan. But the pan isn't mentioned. The user has a knife, red apple, and the stove. Maybe the correct action is "cook red apple with stove."

Wait, the user has already put the apple on the stove. Maybe the next step is to "heat" the apple. But the game might not have that verb. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the stove as a tool. The game might expect "heat" as the verb. But the user tried "heat" and it didn't work. Maybe the correct action is "fry" but with the correct syntax. The user tried "fry red apple with stove" but it didn't work. Maybe the correct command is just "fry red apple." But the game says that's not a verb. This is confusing. Maybe the user needs to use the stove's function. Alternatively, maybe the game is expecting "cook" with the stove. But the user tried that. I think the user is stuck here, and the correct action might be "fry red apple" even though the game says it's not a verb. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the stove's heat.

Earlier, they tried using the stove and pan, but maybe the correct action is different. The recipe says to "fry the red apple," but maybe the game expects a different phrasing. Wait, the user has the knife and the red apple. They chopped the apple, but now they need to fry it. Maybe the correct command is "fry red apple with pan" or "use pan to fry red apple." But the game didn't accept "fry" as a verb. Maybe the right action is "cook red apple" or "heat pan and fry apple." Alternatively, perhaps the user needs to put the apple in the pan first. Let me check the previous steps. The user put the apple on the stove, but maybe the pan is the right tool. Since the game didn't recognize "fry," maybe the correct verb is "cook" or "heat." But the recipe says "fry." Wait, maybe the user needs to use the pan. So the correct command might be "put red apple in pan" followed by "fry." But the user tried "fry red apple with pan" and it didn't work. Maybe the game expects "heat pan" first. Alternatively, maybe the correct verb is "fry" but with the pan specified.

Alternatively, maybe the user should try "use pan to fry red apple." But the game might not recognize that. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "put red apple in pan" and then "fry." But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next step might be to put the apple in the pan first. Let me check the previous actions. The user has the red apple. They tried to fry it directly. Maybe the correct sequence is to put it in the pan first. So the next action should be "put red apple in pan" or "place red apple in pan." Then, after that, maybe "fry" would work.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a recipe to cook a meal in the kitchen. They've already taken the red apple and the knife, chopped the red apple, and now they're trying to fry it. The problem is that the game doesn't recognize "fry" as a verb, and they're having trouble finding a pan or stove to use.

First, I need to recall the previous steps. The user took the red apple and knife, chopped the red apple, but couldn't fry it. They tried using the stove and pan, but the game didn't accept those actions. The error messages suggest that the verbs aren't recognized, so maybe the correct verbs are different. Also, the user might not have a pan or stove available, but in the kitchen description, there's a stove mentioned. However, the user might need to use the stove as a tool.

Wait, the user tried "use stove" but it wasn't a verb. Maybe the correct action is to put the apple in the stove or use the stove to fry it. Alternatively, maybe the game expects a different verb like "cook" or "heat". But the recipe says "fry", so perhaps the game is expecting "fry" but with the correct object.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the pan. The user has a knife and apple, but no pan. The game mentions a stove, but maybe the stove is the cooking appliance. The user tried "put red apple in pan" but the pan isn't visible. However, the stove might be the right tool here.

Wait, the user is at step -2/15, which might indicate that they have some points but are still missing steps. The recipe requires chopping and frying both apples. The user has chopped the red apple, but the yellow apple is still unprocessed. However, the user is focused on the red apple.

The key issue is that the game doesn't recognize "fry" as a verb. Maybe the correct verb is "cook" or "heat". Alternatively, the user needs to use the stove to cook the apple. Since the user tried "use stove" and it didn't work, maybe the correct action is to put the apple on the stove and then use the stove to cook it.

Alternatively, the user might need to use the pan. But the pan isn't visible. The user tried "put red apple in pan" but the game says the pan isn't there. However, maybe the stove is the correct tool. The user should try putting the apple on the stove and then using the stove to cook it.

So the next step would be to put the red apple on the stove and then use the stove to cook it. But the game might require the verb "cook" instead of "fry". Alternatively, the user might need to use the stove as the cooking appliance. The correct action might be "cook red apple with stove" but the game doesn't recognize that. Alternatively, the user might need to use the stove to heat the apple.

Given the previous errors, the user should try using the stove as the tool. The correct command might be "cook red apple with stove" even if the game doesn't recognize it, but based on the previous interactions, the user might need to use the stove directly. Alternatively, the user might need to use the stove to cook the apple by putting it on the stove and then cooking it.

But the game's error messages suggest that the verbs aren't recognized. The user might need to use the correct verbs like "put" or "place". So the next step is to put the red apple on the stove and then use the stove to cook it. However, the user tried "put red apple on stove" but it wasn't a valid command. The game might require the exact phrase "put red apple on stove" even if it's not recognized. Alternatively, the user might need to use the stove as the tool.

In the end, the user is stuck because the game doesn't recognize the correct verbs. The correct action would be to use the stove to cook the apple, but the user needs to find the right command. The next step is to try using the stove as the tool to cook the apple, even if the game doesn't recognize the verb.

Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is in a text-based game where they need to cook a meal according to a recipe. The recipe says to chop both red and yellow apples, fry them, then prepare the meal. So far, they've managed to chop the red apple and fry both apples. But the last step says "prepare meal," and the game responds that something still needs to be cut.

Wait, maybe the recipe requires both apples to be chopped before frying? The user already chopped the red apple, but maybe the yellow apple hasn't been chopped yet. Let me check the previous steps. The user took the yellow apple and fried it, but didn't mention chopping it. The recipe's directions say "chop the red apple" and "chop the yellow apple" as separate steps. So perhaps the user forgot to chop the yellow apple before frying it. That would explain why the game says something still needs to be cut. So the next action should be to chop the yellow apple with the knife.
