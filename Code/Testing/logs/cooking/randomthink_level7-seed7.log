You arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.

You make out a closed fridge, which looks conventional, here. You can see a closed oven right there by you. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a table. On the table you can make out a knife. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. On the counter you can make out a red apple, a green apple, a red hot pepper, a green hot pepper, a raw red potato, a green bell pepper, a tomato and a cookbook. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

There is a closed plain door leading south. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door.

Okay, let me try to figure out what to do next. The user is in a kitchen game where they need to cook a meal based on the recipe from the cookbook. So far, they've opened the cookbook, looked at the recipe, and took the knife. The recipe requires chopping the green apple, roasting the green apple, chopping the red apple, frying the red apple, chopping the red hot pepper, and roasting the red hot pepper.

The user's last action was taking the knife. Now, they need to chop the green apple. But earlier, when they tried to chop the green apple, the game said they need a knife. Since they just took the knife, the next logical step is to use it on the green apple. So the next action should be to chop the green apple with the knife they took. That makes sense because the recipe says to chop the green apple first. Let me check the previous steps again to make sure. Yes, the user has the knife now, so they can proceed to chop the green apple. The next command should be "chop the green apple".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe in the cookbook. The recipe requires chopping the green apple, roasting it, chopping the red apple, frying it, and then chopping and roasting the red hot pepper. So far, the user has tried to chop the green apple but forgot they need the knife. They took the knife from the table, but then tried to chop again without specifying the object.

Wait, the error message says "Cutting something requires a knife." But they already have the knife in their inventory. Maybe they need to use the 'chop' command with the specific object. Let me check the available commands again. The user can use 'chop' followed by the object, but they might need to specify the object clearly. The green apple is on the counter, so maybe they need to take it first or use the 'chop' command directly on it. But the previous attempt to chop the green apple without the knife failed. Since the user has the knife now, the next step should be to chop the green apple again, making sure to use the correct command. Alternatively, maybe they need to use the 'examine' command to check the apple's state. But the main issue is that the user is stuck on the same action. The correct next step is to chop the green apple again, using the knife they took. The system might require the exact command 'chop the green apple' again, ensuring the knife is in the inventory. So the next action should be 'chop the green apple'.

You arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.

You make out a closed fridge, which looks conventional, here. You can see a closed oven right there by you. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a table. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. On the counter you can make out a red apple, a green apple, a red hot pepper, a green hot pepper, a raw red potato, a green bell pepper, a tomato and a cookbook. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

You arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.

You make out a closed fridge, which looks conventional, here. You can see a closed oven right there by you. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a table. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. On the counter you can make out a red apple, a green apple, a red hot pepper, a green hot pepper, a raw red potato, a green bell pepper, a tomato and a cookbook. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

There is a closed plain door leading south. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door.

You arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.

You make out a closed fridge, which looks conventional, here. You can see a closed oven right there by you. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a table. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. On the counter you can make out a red apple, a green apple, a red hot pepper, a green hot pepper, a raw red potato, a green bell pepper, a tomato and a cookbook. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

There is a closed plain door leading south. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door.

You make out a closed fridge, which looks conventional, here. You can see a closed oven right there by you. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a table. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. On the counter you can make out a red apple, a green apple, a red hot pepper, a green hot pepper, a raw red potato, a green bell pepper, a tomato and a cookbook. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

There is a closed plain door leading south. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door.
