You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

You've just walked into a kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You see a fridge. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? The fridge contains a raw white tuna, a block of cheese, a white onion, a raw red tuna, a lettuce and a carrot. You make out an oven, so there's that. You can make out a table. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a red hot pepper, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me think through this. The user is in a kitchen, and their goal is to cook a meal using the ingredients from the fridge and counter. So far, they've opened the fridge, checked the ingredients, then tried to open the cookbook but couldn't. Then they took the cookbook from the counter. Now they're asking if they're on the right track and what the next step should be.

First, the cookbook is essential for finding the recipe. Since they've taken it, the next logical step is to look at the cookbook's contents. The user needs to check the recipe to see what ingredients are needed and how to prepare the dish. The ingredients available include tuna, cheese, onion, lettuce, carrot, potato, pepper, and apple. The recipe might require specific combinations.

But in the current environment, the user has the cookbook. So the next action should be to open the cookbook to read the recipe. However, earlier when they tried to open it, it said it wasn't something you could open. Maybe they need to look at it instead. Wait, the user just took the cookbook from the counter, so maybe the next step is to read it. But the game's mechanics might require using the 'look' command or something similar. However, the user's previous action was 'take cookbook from counter', and now they need to process it.

Alternatively, maybe the cookbook is in their inventory now, so they need to open it. But the game might have specific commands. Since the user tried to open it before and it didn't work, perhaps the correct action is to look at the cookbook. But the available commands are limited to actions like 'look', 'take', 'use', etc. However, the user's previous actions were 'open fridge', 'open cookbook' (which failed), 'take cookbook from counter'.

Now, the user is at step 4, and the next action should be to check the cookbook's contents. So maybe the correct command is 'look at cookbook' or 'read cookbook'. But in the game's context, maybe the command is 'open cookbook' again, but the system said it wasn't something you can open. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to 'use' the cookbook. But the user's previous action was taking it, so the next step is to check it. However, the game might require the user to look at it. But the user's possible commands are limited to the ones allowed. Since the user is in the kitchen, and the cookbook is in their inventory, the next step is to read the recipe. So the correct command would be 'look at cookbook' or 'read cookbook'. But the user has to use the exact command allowed. Since the user previously tried 'open cookbook' and it failed, maybe the correct action is 'look at cookbook'. But the user's previous action was taking it, so the next step is to check it. Therefore, the next command should be 'look at cookbook'.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe in the cookbook. The recipe requires three ingredients: red hot pepper, white tuna, and yellow potato. The directions mention chopping and roasting them.

First, I need to check what items are available. The fridge has raw white tuna, raw red tuna, lettuce, carrot, etc. But the recipe specifies white tuna, so the raw white tuna in the fridge is needed. The counter has a red hot pepper, yellow potato, and other things. The user already took the cookbook, so now they need to gather the ingredients.

The next step would be to collect the red hot pepper, white tuna, and yellow potato. The user has already taken the cookbook, so now they need to take the ingredients. Let's check the items again. The counter has a red hot pepper and a yellow potato. The fridge has the raw white tuna. So the user needs to take these three items.

But in the previous steps, the user was in the kitchen, saw the fridge and counter. The user took the cookbook from the counter. Now, they need to take the red hot pepper (already on the counter), yellow potato (also on the counter), and raw white tuna from the fridge. Once they have all three, they can follow the directions: chop the red hot pepper, fry it, chop the white tuna, roast it, etc. Then prepare the meal. So the next action should be to take the red hot pepper from the counter. Wait, but the user is already in the kitchen. Let me check the available items again. The counter has red hot pepper, yellow potato, and the fridge has raw white tuna. So the user needs to take those three items. The next step is to take the red hot pepper. But the user is at the kitchen, so maybe the next action is to take the red hot pepper from the counter. Then take the yellow potato, then go to the stove or oven to cook. But the directions say to chop and fry, so maybe the user needs to use the knife. Wait, the counter has a knife. So the user might need to take the knife as well. But the recipe doesn't mention a knife, so maybe not. The main ingredients are the three items. So the next action is to take the red hot pepper from the counter. Then the yellow potato. Then the white tuna from the fridge. Once all three are gathered, proceed with the steps. So the next command should be to take the red hot pepper.

You've just walked into a kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You see a fridge. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? The fridge contains a raw white tuna, a block of cheese, a white onion, a raw red tuna, a lettuce and a carrot. You make out an oven, so there's that. You can make out a table. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

You've just walked into a kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You see a fridge. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? The fridge contains a raw white tuna, a block of cheese, a white onion, a raw red tuna, a lettuce and a carrot. You make out an oven, so there's that. You can make out a table. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

You've just walked into a kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You see a fridge. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? The fridge contains a raw white tuna, a block of cheese, a white onion, a raw red tuna, a lettuce and a carrot. You make out an oven, so there's that. You can make out a table. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

You've just walked into a kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You see a fridge. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? The fridge contains a raw white tuna, a block of cheese, a white onion, a raw red tuna, a lettuce and a carrot. You make out an oven, so there's that. You can make out a table. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

You've just walked into a kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You see a fridge. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? The fridge contains a raw white tuna, a block of cheese, a white onion, a raw red tuna, a lettuce and a carrot. You make out an oven, so there's that. You can make out a table. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You see a counter. The counter is vast.
