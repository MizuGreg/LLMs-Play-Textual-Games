You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Shed =-
You've just walked into a shed. The room is well lit.

You see a toolbox. You can make out a workbench. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! But there isn't a thing on it.

There is a closed barn door leading west.

You can see a patio table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a patio table, go to TextWorld. The patio table is stylish. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can make out a patio chair. However, the patio chair, like an empty patio chair, has nothing on it. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a BBQ.

There is an open barn door leading east. There is a closed screen door leading north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is in a text-based game where they need to cook a meal by finding a recipe in the kitchen. So far, they've been moving through different areas: the shed, the backyard, and now a corridor. The goal is to find the cookbook in the kitchen, but they've been going west and north, which led them to the corridor.

In the corridor, the description mentions an open screen door leading south, and exits to the north and west. The user is at the corridor now. The previous steps involved opening doors to move around. The user is asking if they're on the right track and if they're close to the goal.

Hmm, the original goal was to check the cookbook in the kitchen. The shed had a closed barn door leading west, which they opened and went west to the backyard. Then they went north through the screen door, leading to the corridor. Now, they need to find the kitchen. Maybe the kitchen is in one of the directions from the corridor. The exits are north, west, and south. The screen door south leads back to the backyard. The corridor's description doesn't mention a kitchen directly, but maybe moving west or north from here could lead to the kitchen. Alternatively, maybe the kitchen is in the south, but the backyard didn't have the cookbook. Wait, the initial instruction said to check the cookbook in the kitchen. So the user needs to find the kitchen first.

In the backyard, there was a BBQ, but no cookbook. The shed's toolbox and workbench didn't have anything. So the kitchen must be somewhere else. The corridor's exits are north, west, and south. The user is at the corridor. If they go west, maybe they can find the kitchen. Alternatively, going north might lead to another area. But the user is trying to find the kitchen to check the recipe. So the next step should be to explore the possible exits from the corridor. Since the user is in the corridor, maybe going west or north is the way to go. The user's previous actions were moving west and north, so perhaps the kitchen is in the north or west direction. The user should try moving in one of those directions to find the kitchen. The next action should be to go west or north. But the user is asking if they're close. Since they've been moving through the shed, backyard, and corridor, maybe they're getting closer. The next step is to try moving west or north from the corridor. Let's check the possible directions. The corridor has an exit to the north and west. So the user should try going west or north. The user's last action was going north, but the screen door was already open. Wait, the user was in the corridor, and the exits are north, west, and south. The user needs to find the kitchen. Maybe the kitchen is in the north direction. So the next action would be to go north. Alternatively, maybe the kitchen is in the west. But without more information, the user should try one of the directions. Since the user is in the corridor, and the previous steps led them there, the next logical step is to go west or north. The user might need to try west first. But the user is in the corridor, and the exits are north, west, and south. The user should try moving in one of those directions. The user's previous action was going north, but the screen door was already open. Wait, the user was in the backyard, opened the screen door, went north to the corridor. Now, in the corridor, the exits are north, west, and south. The user needs to find the kitchen. So perhaps the kitchen is in the north or west. The user should try going west. Alternatively, maybe the kitchen is in the north. But without more info, the user should try one direction. The user's next action would be to go west or north. Since the user is in the corridor, and the goal is to find the kitchen, the next step is to explore those directions. The user should go west.

-= Bedroom =-
You've entered a bedroom.

You smell a great smell, and follow it to a bed. The bed is large. But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is an exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door.

-= Livingroom =-
You've come into a typical room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be typical. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the livingroom. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You can make out a sofa. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.

You need an exit without a door? You should try going east. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.

You can see a closed fridge here. Oh, great. Here's an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a knife. You can make out a counter! The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a tomato and a cookbook, so there's that. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You move on, clearly upset by TextWorld.

There is a closed frosted-glass door leading east. There is an exit to the south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the original goal. So far, they've navigated through various rooms: shed, backyard, corridor, bedroom, living room, and now the kitchen. The kitchen is where the cookbook and ingredients are likely located.

In the kitchen, the user found a closed fridge, an oven, a table with a knife, a counter with a tomato and a cookbook, and a stove. The original goal was to check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. The user hasn't opened the cookbook yet. 

The next logical step would be to open the cookbook to get the recipe. The user is in the kitchen, so opening the cookbook is the immediate action needed. The other items like the fridge and stove might be for later steps once the recipe is known. Since the cookbook is mentioned as being on the table, the user should pick it up and open it. 

The previous actions involved moving through rooms, so the next command should be to take the cookbook. But the user's last action was moving east to the kitchen. Now, they need to interact with the cookbook. The correct command here is to open the cookbook. However, in some text adventures, you might need to take an item first. But since the cookbook is already in the room, the user can open it directly. 

Wait, the user's last message says "Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?" The user is asking if they're on the right track. The answer is yes, they're in the kitchen where the cookbook is. The next step is to open the cookbook to get the recipe. So the next command should be "open cookbook".

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal based on the cookbook in the kitchen. They've arrived at the kitchen, which is part of the environment. The cookbook is in the kitchen, but it's closed. The user tried to open it, but it wasn't possible. Now, they need to figure out the next step.

The goal is to check the cookbook for the recipe. Since the cookbook is closed, maybe they need to find a way to open it. But in the previous interaction, when they tried to open the cookbook, it didn't work. So perhaps there's another way to access the recipe. Alternatively, maybe the cookbook is already open, but the user needs to interact with it differently. Wait, the user saw the cookbook in the kitchen, but couldn't open it. Maybe they need to look for a key or another object to open it. Or maybe the cookbook is a special item that can be read without opening. But according to the game's rules, the user has to interact with objects to use them. Since the cookbook is closed, they might need to find a way to open it. However, the user tried "open cookbook" and it didn't work. So maybe the next step is to look for something else that can help open it. Alternatively, maybe the recipe is already accessible through another method. But the original instruction was to check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. So perhaps the user needs to find the right way to open the cookbook. Maybe there's a key in the shed or another room. Alternatively, maybe the cookbook is a book that can be read by taking it. Wait, the user is in the kitchen, and the cookbook is on the table. Maybe they need to take the cookbook first, then open it. But the previous attempt was to open it directly. So maybe the correct action is to take the cookbook first. Let me check the previous messages. The user was in the kitchen and saw the cookbook on the table. The user tried to open it, but it wasn't possible. So maybe the next step is to take the cookbook, then open it. But the game might require that you take the object first. So the correct action would be to take the cookbook, then open it. But the user hasn't taken it yet. So the next command should be "take cookbook", then "open cookbook". But the user's last action was "open cookbook", which didn't work. So the next step is to take the cookbook. Therefore, the correct command is "take cookbook".

On the table you can make out a knife. You can make out a counter! The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a tomato, so there's that. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You move on, clearly upset by TextWorld.

There is a closed frosted-glass door leading east. There is an exit to the south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.

You can see a closed fridge here. Oh, great. Here's an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a knife. You can make out a counter! The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a tomato, so there's that.

You find yourself in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.

You can see a closed fridge here. Oh, great. Here's an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a knife. You can make out a counter! The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a tomato, so there's that. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You move on, clearly upset by TextWorld.

There is a closed frosted-glass door leading east. There is an exit to the south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.

You find yourself in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.

You can see a closed fridge here. Oh, great. Here's an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a knife. You can make out a counter! The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a tomato, so there's that. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You move on, clearly upset by TextWorld.
