You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Livingroom =-
Well how about that, you are in the place we're calling the livingroom.

You can see a sofa. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

There is an exit to the south.

You are in a bedroom. A typical one. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You see a bed. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door. There is an exit to the south.

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.

You can make out an opened fridge. The fridge contains a green bell pepper, a green apple, a green hot pepper and a white onion, so there's that. A closed oven is right there by you. You can make out a table. On the table you can make out a knife. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw red potato, a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You move on, clearly upset with TextWorld.

There is an open frosted-glass door leading east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the cookbook in the kitchen. So far, they've navigated through the living room, bedroom, corridor, and now the kitchen. The kitchen has all the ingredients listed: green bell pepper, green apple, green hot pepper, white onion, raw potatoes, and a cookbook. There's also a fridge, oven, stove, and a counter with the cookbook.

The user's goal is to find the recipe in the cookbook and then cook a meal. The current location is the kitchen, and the next step would be to check the cookbook. The user has already pressed a secret button that revealed the counter with the cookbook. So the next logical step is to pick up the cookbook and check the recipe.

The available exits are east (frosted-glass door) and north. But the main task is to find the recipe. Since the cookbook is on the counter, the user should take it. Then, they can look through the recipe to see what's needed. Once the recipe is known, they can gather the ingredients and cook the meal. The user has all the necessary ingredients except maybe the cookbook, which is now available. So the next action should be to take the cookbook from the counter.

Okay, let me think through this. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the cookbook in the kitchen. They've already gone through the living room, bedroom, corridor, and reached the kitchen. In the kitchen, they found the cookbook and took it. Now they're back in the corridor.

The goal is to cook a delicious meal, so the next step would be to use the cookbook. But the user has the cookbook in their inventory now. They need to go back to the kitchen to use it. The corridor has exits to east, north, and south. The kitchen is probably to the south again. So the next action should be to go south back to the kitchen. Then they can check the cookbook and follow the recipe. The user might need to find ingredients, but they already found some in the kitchen. So the correct next step is to go south to the kitchen again.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal using the cookbook found in the kitchen. So far, they've gone through the living room, bedroom, corridor, and back to the kitchen. They took the cookbook from the counter. Now, they're back in the kitchen again.

The goal is to cook a delicious meal, so the next step would be to use the cookbook. The cookbook is on the counter, and they just took it. Now, they need to check if they have all the ingredients needed for the recipe. The fridge has some vegetables: green bell pepper, green apple, green hot pepper, and white onion. The counter has raw potatoes (red, yellow, purple), but no cookbook mentioned here. Wait, in the previous step, the counter had the cookbook, but now it's back to the kitchen, and the counter has the raw potatoes again. The oven is closed, and the stove is there but everything's been taken off it.

So, the user needs to check the cookbook's recipe. But since they just took it, maybe they need to open it. However, the game's previous steps didn't mention opening the cookbook. The user might need to look at the recipe to find the required ingredients. The fridge has some veggies, but the potatoes are on the counter. The user might need to collect all the ingredients from the fridge and the counter. Then, use the oven or stove to cook them. The oven is closed, so maybe they need to open it first. But the user hasn't interacted with the oven yet. So the next action should be to check the cookbook's recipe, but since the user can't open it, maybe they need to look at it. However, the game's interface might require them to use the cookbook to find the recipe. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the ingredients from the fridge and the potatoes to make a dish. The next step would be to use the cookbook to find the recipe, so the action would be to open the cookbook. But the user just took it, so maybe they need to check it. However, the game's previous steps didn't have an open command, so maybe the user needs to look at the cookbook. But the user can only input commands like "take" or "use". Since the cookbook is already taken, the next step is to use it. But the game might require the user to look at the recipe. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go to the stove or oven to cook. But the user is in the kitchen, so the next action is to check the cookbook. However, the user's previous action was "go south" to return to the kitchen. Now, the user is back in the kitchen, and the next step is to use the cookbook. So the correct action is to open the cookbook to check the recipe. But the game's commands might not have an "open" command, so maybe the user needs to look at it. But the user can only input commands like "take" or "use". Since the user already took the cookbook, maybe the next step is to use it. However, the game might require the user to look at the recipe. So the next action is to use the cookbook. But the user hasn't used it yet. So the correct command is "use cookbook".

You arrive in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.

You can make out an opened fridge. The fridge contains a green bell pepper, a green apple, a green hot pepper and a white onion, so there's that. A closed oven is right there by you. You can make out a table. On the table you can make out a knife. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw red potato, a raw yellow potato and a raw purple potato. You can see a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You move on, clearly upset with TextWorld.

There is an open frosted-glass door leading east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

You arrive in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.

You can make out an opened fridge. The fridge contains a green bell pepper, a green apple, a green hot pepper and a white onion, so there's that. A closed oven is right there by you. You can make out a table. On the table you can make out a knife. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw red potato, a raw yellow potato and a raw purple potato. You can see a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You move on, clearly upset with TextWorld.

You arrive in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.

You can make out an opened fridge. The fridge contains a green bell pepper, a green apple, a green hot pepper and a white onion, so there's that. A closed oven is right there by you. You can make out a table. On the table you can make out a knife. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw red potato, a raw yellow potato and a raw purple potato. You can see a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You move on, clearly upset with TextWorld.

There is an open frosted-glass door leading east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

You arrive in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.

You can make out an opened fridge. The fridge contains a green bell pepper, a green apple, a green hot pepper and a white onion, so there's that. A closed oven is right there by you. You can make out a table. On the table you can make out a knife. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw red potato, a raw yellow potato and a raw purple potato. You can see a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You move on, clearly upset with TextWorld.
