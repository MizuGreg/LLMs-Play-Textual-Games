-= Livingroom =-
You find yourself in a livingroom. A typical kind of place.

You can make out a sofa! But the thing is empty. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door.

You arrive in a kitchen. An ordinary one. Let's see what's in here.

A closed fridge is right there by you. You can see a closed oven. You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a yellow apple, a raw red potato, a raw red tuna, a raw yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper and a red apple. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

There is a closed plain door leading east. There is an exit to the north. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a kitchen, and they've opened the fridge, which had a carrot. The goal is to cook a meal using the cookbook. So far, they found some ingredients in the kitchen: apples, potatoes, tuna, peppers, etc. The fridge had a carrot, which is a good addition.

The user needs to follow the recipe from the cookbook. The next step would be to check the cookbook. The cookbook is on the table, so they should pick it up. Then, they can look at the recipe to find out what to cook. Maybe the recipe requires a few ingredients, so they need to gather those. The user has already found some ingredients, but maybe they need to collect more. However, the next immediate action is to check the cookbook. So the correct command is to take the cookbook from the table.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the cookbook in the kitchen. So far, they've gone east from the living room to the kitchen, opened the fridge, took a carrot, then took the cookbook, opened the oven, and put the cookbook inside.

The original goal was to check the cookbook for a recipe and then cook a meal. The user has already found the cookbook and placed it in the oven. But the oven is closed, so maybe they need to heat it up? Or perhaps they need to follow the recipe steps. But the game's environment might have specific actions required. 

Wait, the oven is closed. To use it, maybe they need to open it again? But they just put the cookbook in. Alternatively, maybe they need to use the stove, which is mentioned as conventional. The stove is conventional but has nothing on it. Maybe they need to put ingredients into the stove. 

Looking back, in the kitchen, there are various ingredients on the counter: apple, potato, tuna, etc. The user has the cookbook in the oven. Maybe the next step is to use the stove to cook the ingredients. But the stove is empty. So perhaps they need to put some ingredients into the stove. 

Alternatively, maybe the oven needs to be turned on. But the user has to interact with the oven. Since the oven was opened earlier, maybe they need to close it and then heat it. But the user just put the cookbook in. Maybe the recipe in the cookbook requires using the oven. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to check the cookbook's contents. But the cookbook is in the oven. Maybe they need to take it out and read the recipe. But the oven is closed. Wait, the user put the cookbook in the oven. So to take it out, they need to open the oven again. But the user just opened the oven previously. Maybe they need to close it again. 

Wait, the previous action was putting the cookbook in the oven. Now, the next step would be to close the oven, then maybe heat it. But the user hasn't done that yet. Alternatively, maybe the oven is already open, and the user needs to use it. 

But the original goal was to check the cookbook for the recipe. If the cookbook is in the oven, maybe the user needs to take it out. So the next action would be to open the oven again, take the cookbook out, then read the recipe. But the user hasn't done that yet. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to use the stove. The stove is conventional but has nothing on it. So maybe they need to put ingredients into the stove. But the user hasn't done that yet. 

But the user's previous actions were focused on the oven. Maybe the correct next step is to close the oven, then use the stove. But the user is trying to cook a meal, so perhaps they need to use the stove. 

Alternatively, maybe the oven is supposed to be used with the cookbook inside. But the user needs to close it and then heat it. However, the game might require specific actions. 

Given that the user has the cookbook in the oven, maybe the next step is to close the oven, then heat it. But the user hasn't closed it yet. So the next action would be to close the oven. But the user's last action was putting the cookbook in the oven. So the oven is open. Therefore, the next step would be to close the oven. But the user might need to close it to use it. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to take the cookbook out of the oven to read the recipe. So the next action would be to open the oven again (if it's closed) and take the cookbook. But the user just put it in, so the oven is open. Therefore, the user needs to take the cookbook out. 

But the user's previous action was putting the cookbook in the oven. So the next step would be to take it out. However, the oven is open, so the user can take it out. But the user hasn't done that yet. 

So the next action would be to take the cookbook from the oven. But the user has to interact with the oven. So the correct next action is to take the cookbook from the oven. But the user has to do that. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to use the stove. The stove is conventional but has nothing on it. So maybe the user needs to put ingredients into the stove. 

But the user's main goal is to cook a meal using the cookbook. So the user needs to read the recipe, then cook the ingredients. Since the cookbook is in the oven, maybe the user needs to take it out first. 

So the next action would be to take the cookbook from the oven. But the user has to do that. Therefore, the next command is "take cookbook from oven".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the cookbook. So far, they've gone to the kitchen, opened the fridge, took a carrot, then took the cookbook from the table. They opened the oven, put the cookbook inside, took it back out. Now they're at step 7.

The goal is to cook a delicious meal, so the next logical step would be to use the ingredients in the kitchen. The cookbook is in hand, so maybe they need to follow the recipe. The ingredients available are a yellow apple, raw red potato, raw red tuna, raw yellow potato, yellow bell pepper, and a red apple. Also, there's a stove, but it's described as conventional and broken. Wait, the stove is mentioned as "conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk." So maybe the stove is broken, but they need to use it anyway?

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to prepare the ingredients. Since the cookbook is in the oven, perhaps they need to use it to find the recipe. But the user already took the cookbook from the oven. Wait, in step 6, they put the cookbook in the oven, then took it out in step 7. So now the cookbook is in their inventory.

So the next step would be to check the recipe in the cookbook. But how? Maybe they need to open the cookbook. But the user hasn't done that yet. Alternatively, maybe they need to use the ingredients to cook something. Since the stove is there, even if it's broken, maybe they need to use it. But the stove is described as having nothing on it. Maybe the user needs to put ingredients on the stove.

But the user is in the kitchen, and the cookbook is in hand. So perhaps the next action is to open the cookbook to find the recipe. But the previous actions didn't involve opening the cookbook. So maybe the user needs to open the cookbook now. But the user's last action was taking the cookbook from the oven. So the next step would be to open the cookbook to check the recipe. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the correct action would be to open the cookbook. But the user's previous actions were putting it in the oven and taking it out. So maybe the next step is to open the cookbook to find the recipe. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the answer should be "open cookbook".

You arrive in a kitchen. An ordinary one. Let's see what's in here.

An open fridge is right there by you. The fridge contains a carrot. You can see an opened oven. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a knife. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a yellow apple, a raw red potato, a raw red tuna, a raw yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper and a red apple. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

You arrive in a kitchen. An ordinary one. Let's see what's in here.

An open fridge is right there by you. The fridge contains a carrot. You can see an opened oven. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a knife. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a yellow apple, a raw red potato, a raw red tuna, a raw yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper and a red apple. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

There is a closed plain door leading east. There is an exit to the north. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.

You arrive in a kitchen. An ordinary one. Let's see what's in here.

An open fridge is right there by you. The fridge contains a carrot. You can see an opened oven. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a knife. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a yellow apple, a raw red potato, a raw red tuna, a raw yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper and a red apple. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

There is a closed plain door leading east. There is an exit to the north. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.
