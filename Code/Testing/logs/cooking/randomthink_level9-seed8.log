You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Backyard =-
You find yourself in a backyard. A typical one. You start to take note of what's in the room.

Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a patio chair. But the thing is empty. You can make out a patio table. The patio table is stylish. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You make out a BBQ.

There is a closed sliding patio door leading north. There is a closed barn door leading west. There is an exit to the south.

Okay, so you're in a kitchen, cool, but is it standard? You better believe it is.

A closed fridge, which looks conventional, is close by. You make out a closed oven. You see a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a yellow apple, a yellow bell pepper and a red apple, so there's that. You can make out a stove. But the thing is empty.

There is a closed plain door leading east. There is an open sliding patio door leading south. There is an exit to the north. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.

Okay, the user is in a text-based game where they need to cook a meal. The goal is to check the cookbook in the kitchen, cook a dish, and then enjoy the meal. So far, they've moved from the backyard to the kitchen. The kitchen has a cookbook, a knife, and some ingredients like apples and a bell pepper. The user needs to find the recipe, gather ingredients, and cook something.

The current location is the kitchen. The user has to open the fridge and oven, maybe check the cookbook for the recipe. The next steps would involve looking for the recipe, gathering ingredients, and then cooking. The user has already opened the sliding patio door and moved north to the kitchen. Now, they need to interact with the kitchen items.

The user's next action should be to check the cookbook. Since the cookbook is on the table, they need to take it. Then, they can look at the recipe. After that, they need to collect the necessary ingredients. The fridge might have items like eggs or milk, but the kitchen has apples and a bell pepper. Maybe the recipe requires those. Then, using the stove or oven to cook the meal. The user has to follow the steps in the recipe, which is in the cookbook. So the immediate next action is to take the cookbook from the table.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they need to cook a meal. The goal is to check the cookbook in the kitchen, get the recipe, and then enjoy the meal. So far, they've moved north into the kitchen, opened the sliding patio door, and taken the cookbook from the table. The next logical step would be to look through the cookbook to find the recipe. But the user's last action was taking the cookbook, so the next command should be to open it or read it. However, the game's environment might not have an "open" command for the cookbook, so maybe the player needs to "read" or "check" the cookbook. Alternatively, maybe they need to follow the recipe steps, like gathering ingredients. But the user has already taken the cookbook, so the next action should be to check its contents. The correct command here would be "open cookbook" or "read cookbook". But since the game might not have a "read" command, "open" is more likely. However, in the previous steps, the user took the cookbook, so maybe the next step is to use it to find the recipe. The answer should be "open cookbook".

It isn't something you can open.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the cookbook. They've gone into the kitchen, taken the cookbook from the table, but couldn't open it. So the next step would be to figure out what to do next.

First, the user is in the kitchen. They have the cookbook, but it's closed. Maybe they need to check the table again for other items. The table has a knife, maybe they need to use the knife to open the cookbook? Or perhaps there's another way. Wait, the user already took the cookbook, so maybe they need to look for a recipe inside. But since it's closed, maybe they need to find a way to open it. Alternatively, maybe the cookbook is on the table, and they need to check the counter for ingredients. But the user already took the cookbook. Hmm.

Wait, the previous action was taking the cookbook from the table. Then the game said it isn't something you can open. So maybe the cookbook is a book that needs to be opened, but the user can't open it. So maybe they need to find a way to open it. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to look for the recipe in the kitchen. But the user is in the kitchen, so maybe they need to check the counter for ingredients. The counter has a yellow apple, a yellow bell pepper, and a red apple. Maybe they need to use those ingredients to cook something. But the user needs the recipe first. 

Alternatively, maybe the user should look for the oven or the stove to start cooking. But the oven is closed. Maybe they need to open the oven. Wait, the user is in the kitchen, and there's a closed oven. So maybe the next step is to open the oven. But the original goal is to cook a meal, so maybe they need to use the ingredients from the counter and the cookbook. But since the cookbook is closed, maybe they need to find a way to open it. Or perhaps the user should check the fridge for more ingredients. The fridge is closed, so maybe they need to open it. 

But the user's last action was taking the cookbook, which was closed. The game said it isn't something you can open. So maybe the user needs to find another way. Wait, maybe the user needs to check the counter again for the recipe. Or maybe the user needs to look for the recipe in the kitchen. Alternatively, maybe the user should try to use the knife to open the cookbook. But the user hasn't used the knife yet. The table has a knife. So maybe the next action is to take the knife from the table. Wait, but the user is already in the kitchen. Let me check the previous steps again.

The user went north into the kitchen, took the cookbook from the table, but couldn't open it. The next step would be to find a way to open the cookbook. Maybe the user needs to use the knife to open it. So the next action would be to take the knife from the table. But the user hasn't taken the knife yet. So the user should take the knife first. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to look for the recipe in the counter. But the counter has apples and a bell pepper. Maybe the user needs to use those ingredients. But without the recipe, they can't know what to do. 

Alternatively, maybe the user should check the fridge. The fridge is closed, so they need to open it. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action could be to open the fridge. But the original goal is to cook a meal, so maybe the user needs to find the recipe first. Since the cookbook is closed, maybe the user needs to find a way to open it. But the game says it's not something you can open. So maybe the user needs to look for another way. 

Wait, maybe the user needs to check the oven. The oven is closed. So maybe the next action is to open the oven. But how does that help? The user needs the recipe to cook. So maybe the user should check the counter again for ingredients. The counter has apples and a bell pepper. Maybe the user needs to use those. But without the recipe, they can't. So perhaps the user should look for the recipe in the kitchen. But the cookbook is closed. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check the door leading east. The user is in the kitchen, and there's a closed plain door leading east. Maybe that's a way to get to another part of the house where the recipe is. But the user hasn't checked that yet. 

So the user has a few options: open the oven, open the fridge, take the knife, check the east door, or look for other items. Since the user is trying to cook, maybe the next step is to open the oven to start cooking. But the user needs the recipe. Alternatively, maybe the user should take the knife to open the cookbook. So the next action would be to take the knife from the table. But the user hasn't taken it yet. 

Wait, the user is in the kitchen, and the table has a knife. So the user should take the knife first. Then maybe use it to open the cookbook. But the game said that the cookbook isn't something you can open. So maybe the user needs to find another way. 

Alternatively, maybe the user should look for the recipe in the counter. But the counter has apples and a bell pepper. Maybe the user needs to use those. But without the recipe, they can't. 

Hmm, this is a bit confusing. The user's goal is to cook a meal, so they need the recipe. The cookbook is closed, so maybe they need to find a way to open it. But the game says it's not something you can open. Maybe the user needs to look for another way. 

Wait, maybe the user should check the exit to the north. The kitchen has an exit to the north. Maybe that's a way to go back to the backyard. But that's not helpful. 

Alternatively, maybe the user should check the east door. The user is in the kitchen, and there's a closed plain door leading east. Maybe that's a way to get to another room. But the user hasn't checked that yet. 

So the next action could be to open the east door. But the user is in the kitchen, and the door is closed. So the user should try to open it. 

But the user's previous actions were going north, opening the door, taking the cookbook, but couldn't open it. So maybe the next step is to check the east door. 

Alternatively, maybe the user should check the fridge. The fridge is closed. So the user should open it. 

But the user's main goal is to cook a meal. So maybe they need the recipe. Since the cookbook is closed, maybe the user needs to find a way to open it. But the game says it's not something you can open. So maybe the user needs to look for another way. 

Alternatively, maybe the user should check the counter again for ingredients. The counter has apples and a bell pepper. Maybe the user can use those. But without the recipe, they can't. 

Hmm. I think the user should try to open the east door. So the next action is to open the plain door leading east. But the user is in the kitchen. The kitchen has a closed plain door leading east. So the user should open it. 

But the user's previous action was taking the cookbook. So maybe the next step is to open the east door. 

Alternatively, maybe the user should check the oven. The oven is closed. So the user should open it. 

But the user needs the recipe. So maybe the user should take the knife first. 

Wait, the user is in the kitchen, and the table has a knife. So the user should take the knife. 

So the next action is to take the knife from the table. Then maybe use it to open the cookbook. But the game says the cookbook isn't something you can open. So maybe that's not the right approach. 

Alternatively, maybe the user should look for the recipe in the counter. But the counter has apples and a bell pepper. 

This is tricky. The user needs to cook a meal, so they need the recipe. The cookbook is closed, so maybe the user needs to find a way to open it. But the game says it's not something you can open. Maybe the user should look for another way. 

Wait, maybe the user should check the exit to the north. The kitchen has an exit to the north. So the user can go back to the backyard. But that's not helpful. 

Alternatively, maybe the user should check the fridge. The fridge is closed. So the user should open it. 

But the user's main goal is to cook. So maybe the next step is to open the fridge to get ingredients. 

But the user already has some ingredients on the counter. 

Hmm. I think the user should try to open the east door. So the next action is to open the plain door leading east. 

But the user is in the kitchen. The kitchen has a closed plain door leading east. So the user should open it. 

So the next action is to open the plain door leading east.

Okay, so you're in a kitchen, cool, but is it standard? You better believe it is.

A closed fridge, which looks conventional, is close by. You make out a closed oven. You see a table. You see a knife on the table. You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a yellow apple, a yellow bell pepper and a red apple, so there's that. You can make out a stove. But the thing is empty.

There is a closed plain door leading east. There is an open sliding patio door leading south. There is an exit to the north. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.

Okay, so you're in a kitchen, cool, but is it standard? You better believe it is.

A closed fridge, which looks conventional, is close by. You make out a closed oven. You see a table. You see a knife on the table. You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a yellow apple, a yellow bell pepper and a red apple, so there's that. You can make out a stove. But the thing is empty.

There is a closed plain door leading east. There is an open sliding patio door leading south. There is an exit to the north. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.

Okay, so you're in a kitchen, cool, but is it standard? You better believe it is.

A closed fridge, which looks conventional, is close by. You make out a closed oven. You see a table. You see a knife on the table. You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a yellow apple, a yellow bell pepper and a red apple, so there's that. You can make out a stove. But the thing is empty.

There is a closed plain door leading east. There is an open sliding patio door leading south. There is an exit to the north. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.

-= Kitchen =-
Okay, so you're in a kitchen, cool, but is it standard? You better believe it is.

A closed fridge, which looks conventional, is close by. You make out a closed oven. You see a table. You see a knife on the table. You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a yellow apple, a yellow bell pepper and a red apple, so there's that. You can make out a stove. But the thing is empty.

There is a closed plain door leading east. There is an open sliding patio door leading south. There is an exit to the north. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.
