You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

You find yourself in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.

You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, a red bell pepper, an orange bell pepper and a block of cheese. You make out a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a green apple, a raw purple potato, a green bell pepper, a yellow apple, a raw red potato and a green hot pepper. You make out a stove. But the thing is empty.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe in the cookbook. The recipe requires slicing the green apple and roasting it, then dicing and roasting the purple potato. So far, they've sliced the green apple. The next step according to the directions is to roast the green apple. But the user needs a roasting pan or oven. The kitchen has a closed oven. So maybe they need to open the oven first. Wait, the initial description said there's a closed oven. So the next logical step would be to open the oven. Then, put the sliced apple inside and roast it. But the user hasn't opened the oven yet. So the next action should be to open the oven. Let me check the previous steps again. The user tried to open the cookbook, but it was closed. Then they looked at the cookbook and found the recipe. Then they sliced the green apple. Now, the next step is to roast the green apple. But to roast it, they need to use the oven. So first, open the oven. Then put the apple in and roast it. So the next action should be to open the oven.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a recipe in the kitchen game. The recipe says to "roast the green apple" and "roast the purple potato". But when they tried "roast the green apple", the system said that's not a recognized verb.

Hmm, maybe the game expects specific commands instead of natural language. Earlier, the user tried "slice the green apple", which worked because they used the correct verb "slice". Then they tried "roast the green apple", which didn't work. So perhaps "roast" isn't a valid command here. Maybe the correct action is to use the stove instead of the oven? Because the oven was just opened, but maybe the stove is where roasting happens.

Wait, the recipe says "roast the green apple" and "roast the purple potato". The user has a stove, but it's empty. Maybe they need to put the apple and potato in the oven, but the oven was just opened. Alternatively, maybe the game uses "put in oven" or "place in oven" as the correct command. But the user tried "roast" directly, which didn't work. So maybe the correct action is to use the stove. Let me check the environment again.

The kitchen has a stove, but it's empty. The user has a knife, a cookbook, a table with a knife, and the fridge with cheese and peppers. The oven is open. The recipe says to roast, so maybe the oven is the right place. But the game might require using the stove. Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "roast" but with the object specified. Wait, the user tried "roast the green apple" and it didn't work. Maybe the correct command is "put in oven" or "place in oven". But the user hasn't put the apple in the oven yet. Let me think.

The user has the green apple and the purple potato. They need to roast them. The oven is open. So maybe the next step is to put the apple in the oven. But the game might require using the correct verb. Since "roast" didn't work, maybe the correct action is to use the stove. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the oven. Let me check the previous steps.

The user tried "open oven", which worked. Then tried "roast the green apple", which failed. So maybe the correct action is to put the apple in the oven. The command might be "put the green apple in the oven". But the user has to use the correct syntax. The game might expect "put in oven" as a command. Alternatively, maybe "roast" is a valid command but requires the object to be in the right place. Since the user is holding the green apple, maybe they need to roast it directly. But the system said "That's not a verb I recognise." So perhaps the correct verb is "roast" but with the object specified. Wait, maybe the user needs to use the stove. The stove is empty, so maybe they need to put the apple on the stove and roast it. But the recipe says to roast, so maybe the stove is the right place. Alternatively, the oven is the right place. But the user hasn't put the apple in the oven yet.

So the next step is to put the green apple in the oven. The correct command might be "put the green apple in the oven". But the user has to use the correct syntax. Since the user is holding the green apple, maybe they can put it in the oven. So the next action should be "put the green apple in the oven".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a recipe in the kitchen game. The recipe says to slice the green apple and roast it. They tried "roast the green apple" but got an error. Then they tried "put the green apple in the oven" but needed to take it first.

So the current step is to take the green apple. The user has to take the apple from the table. The previous actions were opening the cookbook, slicing the apple, but then they couldn't roast it directly. Now, the correct next step would be to take the green apple so they can put it in the oven. Wait, but the user just tried putting it in the oven without taking it. The game says they need to take it first. So the next action should be taking the green apple from the table. Then, after taking it, they can put it in the oven. But the user's last action was "put the green apple in the oven", which failed because they didn't take it. So the correct next step is to take the green apple. Then, once it's taken, they can put it in the oven. But the user is asking if they're on the right track. They have the ingredients, so taking the apple is necessary. So the next command should be "take green apple".

You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, a red bell pepper, an orange bell pepper and a block of cheese.

You find yourself in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.

You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, a red bell pepper, an orange bell pepper and a block of cheese. You make out an opened oven. The oven is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a raw purple potato, a green bell pepper, a yellow apple, a raw red potato and a green hot pepper. You make out a stove. But the thing is empty.
