-= Bedroom =-
You are in a bedroom. A normal one.

You can see a bed. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game where they need to cook a meal by finding the cookbook in the kitchen. So far, they've been moving between the bedroom and living room. The goal is to check the cookbook in the kitchen, cook the meal, and then enjoy it.

Looking at the current position: the user is in the living room again. The previous moves were going east from the bedroom to the living room, then west back to the bedroom. The exits mentioned are west from the living room and east from the bedroom. But the kitchen hasn't been mentioned yet. The user needs to get to the kitchen to find the cookbook.

The user is asking if they're on the right track and if they're close to the goal. The current location is the living room, which doesn't mention the kitchen. The bedroom also doesn't mention the kitchen. So the next step would be to find a way to the kitchen. Since the living room has an exit to the west (back to the bedroom), and the bedroom has an exit to the north, maybe the kitchen is north of the bedroom? But the user hasn't explored that yet.

Wait, the initial description of the bedroom says there's an exit to the north. The user hasn't tried going north from the bedroom. So the next logical step would be to go north from the bedroom to reach the kitchen. But the user is currently in the living room. To get to the bedroom again, they would go west, then north from the bedroom. But the user is in the living room again, so maybe they need to go west to the bedroom, then north to the kitchen. But the user is asking if they're close. Since the kitchen hasn't been explored yet, they need to proceed towards it. The next action should be to go west back to the bedroom, then north to the kitchen. But the user is in the living room now. The exit to the west is the bedroom. So the next step is to go west again to the bedroom, then north to the kitchen. But the user is in the living room, so the immediate next action is to go west. But the user is asking if they're close. Since they haven't reached the kitchen yet, they need to continue moving towards it. So the next action should be to go west to the bedroom, then north to the kitchen. But the user is in the living room, so the next move is west. But the user is asking for the next action. The current location is the living room, exit to west. So the next step is to go west to the bedroom, then from there go north to the kitchen. But the user is in the living room, so the next command is go west.

-= Bedroom =-
You are in a bedroom. A normal one.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing a text-based game where the goal is to cook a meal by finding a recipe in the kitchen. So far, they've been moving between the bedroom and living room, going east and west. The current location is the bedroom again, with the same description.

The user is asking if their actions so far are correct and if they're close to the goal. The original goal was to check the cookbook in the kitchen. But the player hasn't mentioned entering the kitchen yet. The bedroom and living room are the only places they've visited. The kitchen hasn't been explored. 

So, the next logical step would be to find the kitchen. The current room is the bedroom, and the description mentions an exit to the north. Maybe the kitchen is north of the bedroom. The player needs to go north to reach the kitchen, check the cookbook, and then cook the meal. 

The user's previous actions have been moving east and west, which are the same rooms. So, the next action should be to go north from the bedroom to access the kitchen. That makes sense because the kitchen is the place where the cookbook is located. The player hasn't found the cookbook yet, so moving towards the kitchen is the right direction. 

Therefore, the correct next action is to go north.
