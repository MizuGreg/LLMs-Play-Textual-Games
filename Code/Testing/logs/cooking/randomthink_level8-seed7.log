You arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.

You make out a closed fridge, which looks conventional, here. You can see a closed oven right there by you. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a table. On the table you can make out a knife. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. On the counter you can make out a red apple, a green apple, a red hot pepper, a green hot pepper, a raw red potato, a green bell pepper, a tomato and a cookbook. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

There is a closed plain door leading south. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a kitchen game where they need to cook a meal using the cookbook. The recipe requires specific ingredients and steps. So far, they tried opening the cookbook but it wasn't possible, then looked around and at the cookbook. Now, after opening it, the recipe is clear.

The ingredients needed are green apple, red apple, and red hot pepper. The directions mention chopping and roasting them. The user has to gather these ingredients and follow the steps. The current state shows that the ingredients are present: there's a green apple, red apple, and red hot pepper on the table. The user needs to chop and roast them as per the recipe.

The next step would be to collect the ingredients. Since the user is already in the kitchen, they should take each ingredient. The commands would involve taking the green apple, red apple, and red hot pepper. Then, perform the actions like chopping and roasting. But the user's next action should be to take the ingredients first. So the correct command is to take the green apple, red apple, and red hot pepper. But since the game might require one command at a time, maybe start with taking the green apple first. Wait, but the user can take multiple items. However, the game might require individual commands. Let me check the previous interactions. The user tried "open cookbook" which failed, then "look around" and "look at cookbook". Now, after opening, the recipe is available. The next logical step is to take the required ingredients. So the user should take the green apple, red apple, and red hot pepper. But the game might require each action separately. However, the user can take all three in one command if allowed. But in many text games, you can only take one item at a time. So the user should take the green apple first. But the user might need to take all three. Alternatively, the user can take them all in one action. But the game's response might require individual commands. However, the user's next action should be to take the ingredients. So the correct command is "take green apple", then "take red apple", then "take red hot pepper". But the user is supposed to output only the next command. Since the user is in the kitchen and the ingredients are available, the next step is to take the green apple. So the answer is "take green apple".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe in the cookbook. The recipe requires gathering specific ingredients: green apple, red apple, and red hot pepper. So far, they've taken the green apple. The next step would be to get the red apple. The user might need to pick up the red apple from the counter. Let me check the previous steps again.

In the kitchen, the counter has a red apple listed. The user has already taken the green apple, so the next logical action is to take the red apple. Then, after getting both apples, they might need to chop them as per the recipe directions. But the current step is to collect the ingredients. So the next action should be taking the red apple. Wait, but the user's last action was taking the green apple, and the score increased. Now they need to proceed to take the red apple next. Let me confirm the ingredients again: green apple, red apple, and red hot pepper. So after green apple, the next is red apple. So the next command should be "take red apple".

So the next step after taking the green and red apples is to chop the green apple. But the user is in the kitchen, and the items are on the counter. So the next action would be to chop the green apple. But how does the game handle that? The user has to interact with the items. So the next command should be "chop green apple".

Okay, the player has taken the green and red apples, and now they're trying to chop the green apple. The next step is to figure out what tool to use for chopping. In a kitchen, common tools for chopping are a knife or a chopping board. But since the player already took the knife from the table earlier, maybe they should use that.

Wait, the user mentioned that the knife is on the table. So the player has the knife in their inventory. The game might expect the player to use the knife to chop the apple. The prompt asks, "What do you want to chop the green apple with?" So the correct response would be to use the knife. But the player's previous action was "chop green apple," which might have triggered the need to specify the tool. However, the game might automatically assume the knife if it's available. But since the user is asking for the tool, maybe the correct answer is to use the knife. So the next action should be "use knife" or "chop green apple with knife." But the game might require the player to specify the tool. However, the previous action was "chop green apple," and the system responded with the question about the tool. So the player needs to answer that. But the user's instruction says to only output the command, so the correct answer here is "use knife" or "chop green apple with knife." But the game might expect "use knife" as the next action. Alternatively, maybe the player should just proceed with chopping, and the game will handle the tool. But since the system is asking for the tool, the player needs to specify it. So the correct next action is "use knife" or "chop green apple with knife." But the game might require the player to use the knife. Therefore, the answer is "use knife."

You arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.

You make out a closed fridge, which looks conventional, here. You can see a closed oven right there by you. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a table. On the table you can make out a knife. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. On the counter you can make out a red hot pepper, a green hot pepper, a raw red potato, a green bell pepper, a tomato and a cookbook. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

There is a closed plain door leading south. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door.

You arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.

You make out a closed fridge, which looks conventional, here. You can see a closed oven right there by you. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a table. On the table you can make out a knife. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. On the counter you can make out a red hot pepper, a green hot pepper, a raw red potato, a green bell pepper, a tomato and a cookbook. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

There is a closed plain door leading south. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door.

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.

You make out a closed fridge, which looks conventional, here. You can see a closed oven right there by you. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a table. On the table you can make out a knife. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. On the counter you can make out a red hot pepper, a green hot pepper, a raw red potato, a green bell pepper, a tomato and a cookbook. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

There is a closed plain door leading south. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door.

You arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.

You make out a closed fridge, which looks conventional, here. You can see a closed oven right there by you. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a table. On the table you can make out a knife. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. On the counter you can make out a red hot pepper, a green hot pepper, a raw red potato, a green bell pepper, a tomato and a cookbook. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

There is a closed plain door leading south. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door.

But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

There is a closed plain door leading south. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door.

You arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.

You make out a closed fridge, which looks conventional, here. You can see a closed oven right there by you. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a table. On the table you can make out a knife. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. On the counter you can make out a red hot pepper, a green hot pepper, a raw red potato, a green bell pepper, a tomato and a cookbook. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove.
