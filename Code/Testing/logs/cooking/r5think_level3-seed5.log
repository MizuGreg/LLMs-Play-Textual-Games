You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
A decrepit board tells you that you are now in the kitchen.

You can make out a fridge. The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, a lettuce, a yellow apple and an orange bell pepper. You see a closed oven in the room. You can make out a table! The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You can make out a counter. You see a banana, a raw purple potato, a green apple and a green hot pepper on the counter. Classic TextWorld. You see a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal in the kitchen. The goal is to check the cookbook for a recipe and then make a meal. So far, they've looked around, checked the fridge, counter, under the table and counter, but didn't find the cookbook. Wait, the cookbook is on the table, but they didn't check it yet. The user tried to open the cookbook but couldn't. Maybe the cookbook is closed, so they need to open it. But the initial attempt to open it failed. Maybe the cookbook is in a place they haven't checked yet. Wait, the table has the cookbook and a knife. The user hasn't checked the table yet. Wait, the user said "look around" and then "look under table" and "look under counter", but maybe the cookbook is on the table, so they need to check the table again. But the user hasn't looked at the table's contents yet. Wait, the first description said "On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife." So the cookbook is on the table. The user didn't check the table's contents yet. So maybe the next step is to check the table again, perhaps pick up the cookbook. But the user tried to open it earlier. Maybe the cookbook is closed, so they need to open it. But the user tried to open it and it wasn't possible. Wait, the first action was "open cookbook", but the response was "It isn't something you can open." So maybe the cookbook is not in a place where it can be opened directly. Maybe the user needs to pick it up first. So the correct steps would be: pick up the cookbook from the table, then open it. But the user hasn't picked it up yet. So the next action should be to take the cookbook from the table. Let me check the previous actions. The user looked around, under table, under counter, in fridge, counter. The cookbook is on the table. So the next step is to take the cookbook from the table. Then, once picked up, maybe open it. But the user tried to open it directly and it didn't work. So perhaps the correct sequence is to take the cookbook first. So the next action should be "take cookbook" or "get cookbook" from the table. But the available commands are to interact with objects. So the user needs to take the cookbook from the table. Then, after taking it, they can open it. So the next action is to take the cookbook.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe in the cookbook. So far, they've taken the banana and lettuce. The recipe requires dice the banana, fry the banana, dice the lettuce, roast the lettuce, chop the yellow bell pepper, roast the yellow bell pepper, and then prepare the meal.

The user has already taken the banana and lettuce. Next, they need to get the yellow bell pepper. Wait, the fridge has a yellow bell pepper. So maybe they should take the yellow bell pepper next. But let me check the current location. The user is in the kitchen, and the fridge is there. So the next step would be to take the yellow bell pepper from the fridge. But wait, the user just took the lettuce from the fridge. Oh, right, the fridge has yellow bell pepper, lettuce, yellow apple, and orange bell pepper. So the user needs to take the yellow bell pepper. Then, after getting all the ingredients, they need to follow the directions: dice the banana, fry it, dice the lettuce, roast it, chop and roast the yellow bell pepper. Then prepare the meal.

But the user has to interact with the game by taking the ingredients and performing the actions. So the next step is to take the yellow bell pepper from the fridge. Let me check the previous steps. The user took the banana from the counter and the lettuce from the fridge. Now, they need to take the yellow bell pepper from the fridge. So the next command should be 'take yellow bell pepper from fridge' or just 'take yellow bell pepper'. But in the game, maybe it's just 'take yellow bell pepper' since they're in the fridge's location. Wait, the user is in the kitchen, and the fridge is in the kitchen. So after taking the lettuce from the fridge, the user is still in the kitchen. So they can take the yellow bell pepper from the fridge. So the next action is to take the yellow bell pepper. Then, after that, they can proceed to dice the banana, etc. So the next command should be 'take yellow bell pepper'.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the recipe from the cookbook. They've collected the banana, lettuce, and yellow bell pepper. The next step in the recipe is to "dice the banana," but they're having trouble with the command.

The user tried "dice banana" but got an error about not recognizing the verb. Then they tried "use knife" but the system said they can't see the knife. Wait, the knife is on the table, right? The user had previously taken the cookbook but not the knife. So maybe they need to take the knife first.

But the user's last action was "use knife" which didn't work because the knife wasn't in their inventory. So the correct steps would be to take the knife from the table, then use it to dice the banana. But the user hasn't taken the knife yet. So the next action should be to take the knife first. But the user is at the step where they need to dice the banana. So maybe the correct command is to use the knife on the banana after taking it. But the system might require the knife to be in hand. So the user needs to take the knife first. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action should be to take the knife from the table. But the user's last action was "use knife" which didn't work. So the correct next step is to take the knife first. But the user might not have noticed that the knife is on the table. So the answer should be to take the knife.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the recipe from the cookbook. So far, they've gathered the banana, lettuce, and yellow bell pepper. They diced the banana using the knife. Now, the next step in the recipe is to "fry the banana." But the user tried "fry banana" and got an error because the system didn't recognize it as a valid command.

Hmm, maybe the correct command is to use the stove to fry the banana. Since the recipe says "fry the banana," the user needs to interact with the stove. The previous action was dicing the banana, so now they need to use the stove. The available objects in the kitchen are the stove, oven, fridge, counter, table, and the knife. The user has the knife, but frying might require using the stove. So the next step should be to use the stove to fry the banana. The correct command would be "fry banana with stove" or something similar. But since the system might expect a specific command, maybe "use stove on banana" or "fry banana on stove." Wait, the user tried "fry banana" and it didn't work. So perhaps the correct action is to use the stove first. Let me check the previous steps again.

The user has the knife, and they diced the banana. Now, they need to fry it. The stove is in the kitchen. So the next action should be to use the stove to fry the banana. The correct command might be "fry banana with stove" or "use stove to fry banana." But the system might require a specific syntax. Since the user previously used "use knife on banana" to dice it, maybe the correct command here is "use stove on banana" or "fry banana on stove." Alternatively, maybe "fry banana" is correct, but the system is expecting the user to first use the stove. Wait, the user tried "fry banana" and got an error. So perhaps the correct action is to use the stove first. Let me think. The user needs to fry the banana, so they need to interact with the stove. The correct command would be "use stove on banana" or "fry banana with stove." But the system might accept "fry banana" if the stove is the correct tool. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to first turn on the stove. But in the game's context, maybe the correct action is "fry banana" but the system is expecting the user to use the stove. Since the user has the knife, but frying requires the stove, perhaps the next step is to use the stove. So the correct command would be "use stove on banana" or "fry banana on stove." But the user tried "fry banana" and got an error. So maybe the correct action is to use the stove first. Therefore, the next action should be "use stove on banana" or similar. But the user's last action was "dice banana," and now they need to fry it. So the next step is to fry the banana using the stove. The correct command would be "fry banana" but the system might require the user to use the stove. Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "use stove to fry banana." But the system might not recognize that. So the user needs to try "fry banana" again, but since it didn't work, maybe the correct action is to use the stove. Therefore, the next action is "use stove on banana."

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the recipe from the cookbook. The recipe says to "dice the banana, fry the banana, dice the lettuce, roast the lettuce, chop the yellow bell pepper, roast the yellow bell pepper, and prepare meal."

So far, the user has taken the banana, lettuce, and yellow bell pepper. They diced the banana using the knife. Now, the next steps are to fry the banana, dice the lettuce, roast the lettuce, chop the yellow bell pepper, roast the yellow bell pepper, and then prepare the meal.

The user is having trouble with the verbs. The game might not recognize "fry," "roast," "chop," etc., as valid commands. Instead, maybe the correct verbs are "cook," "bake," "cut," or something else. Alternatively, the user might need to use the stove or oven for frying or roasting.

Since the user tried "fry banana" and it didn't work, maybe they need to use the stove. The recipe says "fry the banana," so perhaps the correct action is to "cook the banana on the stove." Similarly, "roast the lettuce" might require using the oven. But the oven is closed, so maybe they need to open it first.

Alternatively, the game might expect specific verbs like "fry" to be used with the stove. The user might need to "fry banana on stove" or "roast lettuce in oven." But the game's response indicates that "fry" isn't recognized, so maybe the correct verb is "cook" or "bake."

Another possibility is that the user needs to "cut" the lettuce and bell pepper instead of "dice" and "chop." But the user already used "dice" for the banana. Maybe the game expects "cut" for the lettuce and "chop" for the pepper.

But the user is stuck on "fry banana." Since the stove is empty, maybe they need to put the banana on the stove first. The correct command might be "put banana on stove" or "cook banana on stove."

Alternatively, the game might have specific verbs like "fry" that require the user to use the stove. Since the user tried "fry banana" and it didn't work, maybe they need to "fry banana on stove."

But the game's response says "That's not a verb I recognise," so maybe the correct verb is "cook" or "bake." Let's try "cook banana" or "bake banana."

Alternatively, the user might need to "roast" the lettuce using the oven. Since the oven is closed, they need to open it first. So the steps could be: open oven, roast lettuce.

But the user is at the step of frying the banana. Maybe the correct action is to "fry banana on stove." However, the game doesn't recognize "fry," so perhaps the correct verb is "cook."

Alternatively, the user might need to "put banana on stove" to start cooking. The game might expect that command.

So, the next action should be to try "cook banana on stove" or "put banana on stove." But since the user is trying to follow the recipe's "fry," maybe the correct verb is "fry" with the stove. However, the game doesn't recognize it, so perhaps the user needs to use "cook."

But the user is in a loop here. The correct next step might be to try "cook banana" or "put banana on stove." Since the user tried "fry" and it didn't work, maybe "cook" is the right verb.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the recipe from the cookbook. The recipe says to dice the banana, fry it, then dice the lettuce, roast the lettuce, chop the yellow bell pepper, roast it, and prepare the meal.

So far, the user has taken the banana, lettuce, and yellow bell pepper. They diced the banana using the knife. Now they need to fry the banana. The problem is that the game doesn't recognize "fry" as a verb. Maybe the correct action is to use the stove. Since the stove is in the kitchen, perhaps the user needs to use the stove to fry the banana. But the previous attempt to use the stove didn't work. Alternatively, maybe the oven is supposed to be used, but the oven is closed. Wait, the oven is closed, so maybe they need to open it first. But the recipe says to fry the banana, which is usually done on the stove, not the oven. Hmm. The user tried "use stove on banana" but got an error. Maybe the correct command is "fry banana with stove" or something similar. But the game's vocabulary might be limited. Alternatively, maybe "cook banana" is the right verb, but the user tried that. The user is stuck on the frying step. Since the recipe says "fry the banana," and the available tools are the knife and the stove, perhaps the correct action is to use the stove to cook the banana. Even though the game says "That's not a verb I recognise," maybe the intended action is "cook banana" with the stove. But the user has already tried that. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to open the oven first, but that's for roasting. Since the recipe says fry, maybe the stove is the right place. The user might need to use the stove to cook the banana. So the next action should be to use the stove on the banana, even though it's not recognized. But the game might expect a different command. Alternatively, maybe the user should try "roast banana" again, but that's not the step. The recipe says fry, so maybe the correct action is to use the stove. The user is stuck here, so perhaps the next step is to try "cook banana" again or "fry banana" with the stove. But the game's response says "That's not a verb I recognise." Maybe the correct command is "put banana on stove" or "heat stove." But the user has to follow the recipe's steps. Since the user is at the "fry banana" step, maybe the correct action is to use the stove. So the next command would be "use stove on banana," even though it's not recognized. But the user has already tried that. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "cook banana" with the stove. But the game's system might not recognize that. The user is stuck, so maybe the next action is to try "cook banana" again.
