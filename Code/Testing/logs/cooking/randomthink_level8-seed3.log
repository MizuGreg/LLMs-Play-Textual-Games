You are in a bathroom. You can barely contain your excitement.

If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a toilet. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a toilet, go to TextWorld. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

You need an exit without a door? You should try going east.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is in a text-based game where they've been moving through different rooms: bathroom, corridor, bedroom, and back and forth. The goal mentioned at the beginning was to cook a meal by checking the cookbook in the kitchen. But so far, the player has been moving between rooms without finding the kitchen.

Looking at the current position, the user is in the Bedroom again after moving north from the Corridor. The prompt mentions that the bedroom has a large bed but nothing else. The previous attempts to move east, north, west, and south have just cycled through the same rooms. The kitchen hasn't been encountered yet, which is where the cookbook is supposed to be.

The user's question is whether they're on the right track and if they're close to the goal. From the movement pattern, it seems like the player is stuck in a loop between the Corridor and Bedroom. The exit to the east from the Corridor was mentioned, but going east from the Bathroom led back to the Corridor. Maybe the kitchen is in a different direction, but the current path doesn't show it. The player needs to find a way to reach the kitchen, which is likely connected to the corridor but hasn't been explored yet. Since the game's environment is text-based and the rooms are interconnected, perhaps the next step is to check other directions or look for clues in the current room. However, the Bedroom doesn't mention a kitchen. Maybe the player needs to look for a different path or check if there's a hidden door or object that leads to the kitchen. But according to the current room descriptions, there's no mention of a kitchen in the Bedroom. Therefore, the player might need to try moving in a different direction from the Corridor, like east, which was mentioned as an exit but not blocked by a door. However, the previous attempts to go east from the Corridor led back to the Bathroom. Maybe the kitchen is in another part of the Corridor, but the player hasn't checked all directions. Alternatively, maybe the player needs to look for a different approach, like checking the bed for something, but the bed is described as empty. The user might need to try moving east again from the Corridor, even though it's been tried before, to see if there's a new path or if the kitchen is there. Alternatively, perhaps the player is supposed to find the kitchen through a different route, but the current movement pattern isn't revealing it. The user is probably stuck in a loop and needs to find a way out of the current rooms to reach the kitchen. The next logical step would be to try moving east again from the Corridor, as that's the exit mentioned, even though it's been tried before. Alternatively, maybe the player needs to look for a different direction in the current room that hasn't been explored. But the Bedroom only has a south exit back to the Corridor. So the next action should be to go east from the Corridor again, hoping that it leads to the kitchen.

The original goal was to cook a meal by checking the cookbook in the kitchen. But so far, the player has been moving between rooms without finding the kitchen.

Looking at the current location, the user is in a corridor again. The clues mentioned earlier about the kitchen's cookbook haven't been addressed. The bathroom has a toilet, but no cookbook. The bedroom has a bed but nothing else. The corridor has an exit to the east, but no kitchen mentioned there.

The user's actions have been going back and forth between the corridor, bedroom, and bathroom. The game's feedback seems to be a loop, maybe a mistake in the setup or a trick. Since the original goal is to find the cookbook in the kitchen, the player needs to find the kitchen. But the current rooms don't mention a kitchen. Maybe the kitchen is in a different direction not yet explored?

Wait, the initial prompt said to check the cookbook in the kitchen. But the player hasn't found the kitchen yet. The current corridor's description mentions an exit to the east, but no kitchen. The user might need to explore other directions. However, in the corridor, the possible directions are north, west, and east. The user has been trying north and south, which loop back. Maybe the kitchen is in the west direction of the corridor? But the corridor's description says west is not blocked. However, the user hasn't tried going west from the corridor yet.

Wait, in the previous steps, when the user was in the corridor (0/13), they went north to the bedroom. Then went south back to corridor (0/14). Then again north to bedroom (0/15), south to corridor (0/16), and so on. The user hasn't tried going west from the corridor. The corridor's description says: "You need an exit without a door? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one." So maybe the west direction is the way to go. But the user has been going north and south, missing the west.

So the next logical step is to go west from the corridor to check if that leads to the kitchen. The user might have been stuck in the loop between bedroom and corridor, not trying the west direction. Therefore, the correct action would be to go west.

You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a bed. The bed is large. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user has been moving back and forth between the Corridor, Bedroom, and Bathroom. The original goal was to cook a meal by checking the cookbook in the kitchen. But so far, the user hasn't found the kitchen yet. They've been going east, north, south, west, but maybe they're stuck in a loop.

Looking at the current location, they're in the Corridor again. The exit is to the east, but there's no door. The hints suggest trying north or west. However, the user has been repeatedly going north and south, which leads them back to the Bedroom. Maybe they need to find a different path. 

Wait, the initial instruction said to check the cookbook in the kitchen. The user hasn't mentioned a kitchen yet. Maybe the kitchen is in a different direction. But in the current environment, the available rooms are Bathroom, Corridor, and Bedroom. The kitchen isn't listed here. Perhaps the game is designed to loop until the player finds the kitchen through some other means, but according to the current room descriptions, there's no kitchen. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to find the cookbook in one of these rooms. The Bedroom has a bed, but no cookbook. The Bathroom has a toilet. The Corridor has an exit to the east, but no cookbook. So maybe the user is stuck in a loop and needs to find another way. But according to the game's current setup, the only exits are the ones mentioned. 

The user's actions have been consistent: going north and south between the Bedroom and Corridor, and east to the Bathroom. Since the original goal is to find the cookbook in the kitchen, but the kitchen isn't in the current rooms, maybe the game is a trick or there's a hidden path. However, based on the given information, the user hasn't found the kitchen yet. 

The next logical step would be to try going east again from the Corridor, as that's the exit mentioned. But the user has already done that and ended up in the Bathroom. Maybe they need to try west from the Corridor, which is unblocked. The user has been going north and south, but perhaps west is the way to go. However, the user's last action was going north again. 

Wait, the user is in the Corridor (0/35). The hints say to try going north or west. The user has been going north, leading to the Bedroom. Maybe they need to try west from the Corridor. The previous attempt to go west led to the Bathroom. But the user hasn't tried that yet. So the next action should be to go west.

You are in a bathroom. You can barely contain your excitement.

If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a toilet. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a toilet, go to TextWorld. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

You need an exit without a door? You should try going east.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is in a text-based game where they've been moving between rooms: bathroom, corridor, bedroom, and back and forth. The original goal was to cook a meal by checking the cookbook in the kitchen. But so far, the player has been moving between rooms without finding the kitchen or the cookbook.

Looking at the current location, the user is in the Corridor again, with the same descriptions as before. The exit is to the east, but there's no door. The hints suggest trying north or west. The player has been oscillating between the bedroom and corridor, maybe stuck in a loop. 

The user's question is whether they're making the right moves and if they're close to the goal. Given the repeated failure to find the kitchen, it's possible that the kitchen is not in the immediate vicinity or maybe the path requires a different approach. Alternatively, maybe the cookbook is in a room that's not listed, or there's a hidden path.

Since the player has been going back and forth between the corridor and bedroom, perhaps they need to explore other directions. The previous attempts to go east from the bathroom led back to the corridor. Maybe the kitchen is accessible from another direction, like south from the corridor? But the corridor's description says the exit is east, and the user has tried north and west without success.

Alternatively, maybe the player needs to find a way to exit the current area. The original goal was to cook, so perhaps the kitchen is the key. But the player hasn't found it yet. The game might be testing persistence, but it's possible that the player is stuck in a loop and needs a different strategy.

Given the instructions, the next move should be to go west again, as that's the suggested direction from the corridor. But the user has been doing that repeatedly. Maybe the correct path is to go east from the corridor and find the kitchen there. However, the corridor's exit is east, but the user hasn't tried going east from the corridor yet. Wait, in the previous steps, when in the corridor, the user tried north and west, but maybe east is the correct direction to go. However, the user has been going north and south, missing the east exit.

Wait, the user's last action was going north from the corridor, leading back to the bedroom. The corridor's description says there's an exit to the east, so maybe the correct path is to go east from the corridor. But the user hasn't tried that yet. However, in the previous steps, when the user was in the corridor, they tried north and west, but maybe east is the way to go. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next step should be to go east from the corridor to find the kitchen or the cookbook.

-= Livingroom =-
You arrive in a livingroom. A typical one. The room is well lit.

You can make out a sofa. The sofa appears to be empty.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one. There is an exit to the west.

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. An usual one. Let's see what's in here.

You can see a closed fridge close by. You make out a closed oven nearby. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You see a counter. On the counter you can make out a raw red potato, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a raw red tuna, a red hot pepper and a cookbook. What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.

There is a closed frosted-glass door leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is in a text-based game where they've been moving between rooms like a bathroom, corridor, bedroom, living room, and kitchen. The goal was to cook a meal using the cookbook in the kitchen.

Looking at the latest environment, the user is in the Kitchen. The description mentions a closed fridge, oven, table with a knife, potatoes, an apple, a cookbook, and a stove. The user needs to find the cookbook and use it to cook. But the user hasn't opened the fridge or checked the cookbook yet. The previous actions were moving around, and now they're in the kitchen. The next logical step would be to open the fridge to see if the cookbook is inside, but the cookbook is on the table. Wait, the table has the cookbook already. So maybe the user needs to pick it up and then use it. But the user hasn't interacted with the cookbook yet. The game might require opening the fridge first, but the cookbook is on the table. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check the table for the cookbook. Since the cookbook is on the table, the user should pick it up. Then, perhaps use it to cook. But the user hasn't done that yet. The previous actions were just moving, so the next step is to interact with the cookbook. So the correct action would be to take the cookbook from the table.

You've just shown up in a bedroom. You can barely contain your excitement.

You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a bed. The bed is large. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.
