Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an life changing round of TextWorld? You do! Here is your task for today. Your first objective is to head south. With that accomplished, make an attempt to travel south. And then, attempt to go west. And then, move south. And then, attempt to head west. That done, retrieve the coin from the floor of the spare room. Got that? Good!

-= Canteen =-
You are in a canteen. An ordinary one.



You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

-= Dish-Pit =-
I am pleased to announce that you are now in the dish-pit.



There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

-= Basement =-
You are in a basement. A standard kind of place.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game where they have to navigate through different rooms and complete tasks. The initial instructions said to go south, then west, then south again, then west, and finally retrieve a coin from the spare room.

So far, the user has gone south from the canteen to the dish-pit, then south again to the basement. Now, in the basement, the prompt says to try going north or west. The user's next step should be to follow the instructions given in the game. The original task was to go south, then west, then south, then west. But after the first two moves (south, south), they're in the basement. The next steps according to the original plan would be to go west, then south, then west again. But the current room (basement) has options to go north or west. The user needs to go west here. Let me check the previous steps again.

Wait, the first objective was to head south, then make an attempt to travel south again. Then attempt to go west, then move south again, then west. So after the first two moves (south, south), the next step is to go west. The basement room says to try going west. So the next action should be west. Then, after that, the next step would be to move south again. But the user needs to make sure they're following the exact sequence. Let me confirm the steps again:

1. Start in canteen, go south to dish-pit.
2. From dish-pit, go south to basement.
3. From basement, go west (as per the room's suggestion).
4. Then, move south again.
5. Then go west again.
6. Retrieve the coin from the spare room.

So the next action here is to go west in the basement. The user's next command should be "go west".

-= Bedchamber =-
You are in a bedchamber. A normal one.



There is an unguarded exit to the east. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and eventually retrieve a coin. The original goal was to go south, then west, then south again, then west, and get the coin from the spare room.

So far, the user has gone south from the canteen to the dish-pit, then south again to the basement, then west to the bedchamber. The current room is the bedchamber. The exits here are east and south. The next step according to the original plan was to go west again, but in the bedchamber, the west exit isn't mentioned. Wait, the bedchamber has an unguarded exit to the east and an unblocked exit to the south. So maybe the user needs to go south from here. Let me check the previous steps again.

Original plan: After the first south, then west, then south, then west. So after the bedchamber, maybe the next step is south. Because the user was moving in a pattern of south, south, west, and now in the bedchamber, the next direction would be south. Then, after getting to the next room, maybe they can go west again. But the user's current position is the bedchamber, and the exits are east and south. So the next action should be south. Then, in the next room, perhaps there's a west exit. Let me think. The original goal was to get to the spare room and retrieve the coin. So the user is following the path: canteen -> dish-pit -> basement -> bedchamber. The next step is south from the bedchamber. Then, maybe the next room has a west exit. So the next action is go south.

-= Sauna =-
You find yourself in a sauna. A standard kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the west.



>                                                                                                                                -= Sauna =-0/5

-= Spare Room =-
You find yourself in a spare room. A typical kind of place.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a coin on the floor.


>                                                                                                                                -= Spare Room =-0/6
SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me figure out what to do next. The user has been moving through different rooms in the game. The original goal was to retrieve a coin from the spare room's floor. The user has already reached the Spare Room and found the coin there. The current prompt says there's a coin on the floor, so the next step should be to pick it up.

But wait, the user's last action was moving west into the Spare Room. The instruction says to retrieve the coin from the floor. So the correct action here is to pick up the coin. The game might require using the "take" command or something similar. However, looking at the previous interactions, the user has been using "go [direction]" commands. But in the Spare Room, since the coin is on the floor, the appropriate action would be to pick it up. However, the game's commands might be limited to movement. But the user's previous actions were all movement. Wait, maybe the coin is already in the room, so the user just needs to pick it up. But the game might require the user to use the "take" command. However, the user's history shows that they have only used "go" commands. But in the Spare Room, the coin is on the floor, so the correct action is to take the coin. But the user's previous responses were all "go" commands. Maybe the game expects "take coin" but the user is supposed to input that. However, the user's instructions say to only output the action, like "go north". So perhaps the correct action here is "take coin". But I need to check the previous interactions. In the Spare Room, the user is told there's a coin on the floor. So the next step is to pick it up. Therefore, the correct command is "take coin". But the user's previous actions were all movement. However, in the game's context, once the user is in the Spare Room, the next step is to pick up the coin. So the answer should be "take coin".
</think>take coin
