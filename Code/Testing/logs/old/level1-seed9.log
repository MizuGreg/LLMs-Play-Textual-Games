<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is in a text adventure game where they need to cook a meal. The goal is to follow the recipe from the cookbook. The recipe for Recipe #1 requires chopping and roasting a green apple.

So far, the user has checked the cookbook, found the recipe, and tried to chop the green apple. They used the knife on the green apple, but the game said that's not a recognized verb. Wait, maybe the correct action is to chop the apple with the knife. Let me check the previous steps again.

The user first checked the cookbook, then tried to chop the green apple. The game responded that cutting requires a knife, so they used the knife on the apple. But the system said that's not a valid verb. Hmm, maybe the correct action is to chop the apple with the knife. Alternatively, maybe the game expects a specific command structure.

In text adventures, common commands are like "chop [object]" or "use [tool] on [object]". The user tried "use knife on green apple", but the game didn't recognize it. Maybe the correct command is "chop green apple" without using the knife, but the game says cutting requires a knife. So perhaps the correct action is to use the knife on the apple to chop it. But the system said that's not a valid verb. Wait, maybe the game expects "chop" as the verb, and the knife is the tool. So the correct command is "chop green apple with knife"? Or maybe "chop green apple" is the correct command, and the knife is already in hand.

Wait, the user has the knife on the table. So they need to use the knife to chop the apple. But the game might require the exact command. Let me think. The user tried "use knife on green apple", but the game said that's not a recognized verb. Maybe the correct command is "chop green apple" and the knife is automatically used. Alternatively, maybe the game expects "cut green apple with knife". But the recipe says "chop the green apple", so maybe the correct action is "chop green apple".

But the game said that cutting requires a knife, so maybe the user needs to use the knife first. Wait, the user already has the knife. So perhaps the correct command is "chop green apple" and the game will accept it. But the user tried that earlier, and the game said "Cutting something requires a knife." So maybe the user needs to use the knife on the apple. But the system said that's not a valid verb. Maybe the correct command is "cut green apple with knife", but the game might not recognize that. Alternatively, maybe the game expects "chop green apple" and the knife is used implicitly.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to first pick up the knife, then chop the apple. But the user hasn't picked up the knife yet. Wait, in the initial description, the user sees a knife on the table. So the user needs to take the knife first. But in the previous step, the user tried to chop the apple without taking the knife. So maybe the correct sequence is: take knife, then chop apple.

But the user tried "use knife on green apple" and got an error. Maybe the correct command is "take knife", then "chop green apple". Let me check the previous steps again.

The user's last action was "use knife on green apple", which was rejected. The game says "That's not a verb I recognise." So maybe the correct command is "chop green apple" without using the knife, but the game says cutting requires a knife. Therefore, the user needs to use the knife to chop the apple. But the game might require the exact command structure. Maybe the correct command is "chop green apple with knife", but the game might not recognize that. Alternatively, the game might expect "cut green apple with knife".

But the recipe says "chop the green apple", so maybe the correct action is "chop green apple". However, the game says that cutting requires a knife, so the user needs to use the knife. But the user hasn't picked up the knife yet. So the correct sequence is: take knife, then chop green apple.

But the user hasn't taken the knife yet. So the next step should be to take the knife, then chop the apple. But the user's last action was trying to use the knife on the apple, which was invalid. So the correct next action is to take the knife first.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe. The recipe says to chop the green apple, then roast it, and prepare the meal. So far, they've checked the cookbook, found the recipe, and tried to chop the green apple. But they didn't have the knife yet, so they took the knife from the table. Now they have the knife, so the next step would be to chop the green apple again.

Wait, in the previous step, they tried to chop the green apple but got an error because they didn't have the knife. Then they took the knife. Now that they have the knife, they should be able to chop the apple. The next action should be to chop the green apple again. Let me check the commands. The correct command would be "chop green apple" again. But the system might require using the knife explicitly. Wait, in the game's context, maybe the action is just "chop green apple" since they have the knife now. The previous error was because they didn't have the knife, but now they have it. So the next step is to chop the apple. Then roast it. So the next action is to chop the green apple.

You've just sauntered into a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

You see a fridge. What a letdown! The fridge is empty! Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's an oven. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. You can see a table. You see a cookbook on the table. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a green apple, a green bell pepper and a yellow apple. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You see a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.

You've just sauntered into a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

You see a fridge. What a letdown! The fridge is empty! Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's an oven. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. You can see a table. You see a cookbook on the table. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a green apple, a green bell pepper and a yellow apple. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You see a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.

You've just sauntered into a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

You see a fridge. What a letdown! The fridge is empty! Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's an oven. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. You can see a table. You see a cookbook on the table. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a green apple, a green bell pepper and a yellow apple. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You see a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.

-= Kitchen =-
You've just sauntered into a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

You see a fridge. What a letdown! The fridge is empty! Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's an oven. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. You can see a table. You see a cookbook on the table. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a green apple, a green bell pepper and a yellow apple. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You see a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.
