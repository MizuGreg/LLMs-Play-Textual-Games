I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! First of all, you could, like, travel east. With that over with, venture east. And then, make an attempt to venture north. That done, take a trip west. With that accomplished, pick up the coin from the floor of the cookhouse. That's it!

-= Shower =-
You find yourself in a shower. A typical kind of place.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user has been moving through different rooms in TextWorld: shower, cookery, pantry, parlor, and now the cookhouse. The goal mentioned earlier was to pick up the coin from the cookhouse floor.

So far, the user has gone east from the shower into the cookery, then east again into the pantry, north to the parlor, and west back to the cookhouse. Now, in the cookhouse, there's a coin on the floor. The next step should be to pick up the coin. The instruction says to take a trip west, but that's already been done. Wait, the current room is the cookhouse, and the coin is here. So the correct action is to pick up the coin. The user needs to pick it up to complete the goal. The previous steps led them here, so the next command should be to pick up the coin.
