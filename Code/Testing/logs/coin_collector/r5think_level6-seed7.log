Welcome to TextWorld! First stop, go south. Next, make an attempt to venture east. And then, try to go north. If you can get through with that, attempt to travel north. Then, head west. And then, recover the coin from the floor of the parlor. And if you do that, you're the winner!

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game and has been moving through different rooms. The goal mentioned earlier was to recover the coin from the parlor and then win. So far, they've gone from the bedroom, lounge, dish-pit, laundry place, and now the washroom.

In the washroom, the prompts say to go south or west. The user is at the washroom now. The previous steps have been moving north and south between rooms. The coin is in the parlor, so they need to find a path to the parlor. Let's track the rooms they've been in:

Bedroom → Lounge → Dish-pit → Laundry Place → Washroom. The parlor hasn't been mentioned yet. The original path mentioned going north, east, north, west, then to the parlor. But the user has been going back and forth between some rooms. Maybe they need to go west from the washroom. The washroom's exits are south and west. Going west from the washroom might lead them to the laundry place again, but maybe there's another path. Alternatively, going south from the washroom would take them back to the laundry place. Wait, the user was in the laundry place, then went north to the washroom. So from the washroom, going south would take them back to the laundry place. But the goal is to get to the parlor. Maybe the parlor is connected to the laundry place or the dish-pit. Alternatively, maybe the coin is in the parlor, which is connected to the lounge or another room. The user needs to find the right path. Since the original plan was to go north, east, north, west, then to the parlor, but the current path is getting stuck in loops. Maybe the user needs to go west from the washroom. Let me check the previous rooms. The dish-pit had a west exit. The laundry place had a south exit. The washroom's west exit might lead to another room. If the user goes west from the washroom, they might reach the laundry place again, but perhaps there's a different route. Alternatively, maybe the parlor is connected to the dish-pit or the lounge. The user needs to find the correct path to the parlor. Since the coin is in the parlor, they need to get there. The current room is the washroom. The exits are south and west. Let's think: going west from the washroom might lead to the laundry place again, but maybe from there, they can go north again. Alternatively, maybe the parlor is connected to the dish-pit. The user needs to find the right path. The original plan was to go north, east, north, west, then to the parlor. But the user is now in the washroom. Maybe the correct path is to go west from the washroom to the laundry place, then north to the dish-pit, then west to the lounge, then east to the parlor? Wait, but the user has already been through some of these rooms. Alternatively, maybe the parlor is connected to the lounge. The user needs to find the correct exit. Since the user is in the washroom, the next step is to go west or south. The user's previous action was going north to the washroom. Now, the next action should be to go west from the washroom. Let me check the previous steps again. The user was in the laundry place, went north to the washroom. From the washroom, the exits are south (back to laundry) and west. So going west from the washroom would take them to the laundry place again. But maybe from the laundry place, they can go north again to the dish-pit, then west to the lounge, then east to the parlor. But the user's goal is to get to the parlor. Alternatively, maybe the parlor is connected to the dish-pit. The user needs to find the right path. Since the user is in the washroom, the next step is to go west. So the next action is "go west".

-= Parlor =-
Well, here we are in a parlor.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked.

There is a coin on the floor.
