Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an life changing round of TextWorld? You do! Here is your task for today. Your first objective is to head south. With that accomplished, make an attempt to travel south. And then, attempt to go west. And then, move south. And then, attempt to head west. That done, retrieve the coin from the floor of the spare room. Got that? Good!

-= Canteen =-
You are in a canteen. An ordinary one.



You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

-= Dish-Pit =-
I am pleased to announce that you are now in the dish-pit.



There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

-= Basement =-
You are in a basement. A standard kind of place.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game called TextWorld, and they've been given a series of directions to move through different rooms. The goal is to reach a spare room and retrieve a coin.

First, the user started in the canteen, went south to the dish-pit, then south again to the basement. Now they're in the basement, and the next step is to follow the instructions: after going south twice, they need to go west, then south again, then west again, and finally get the coin from the spare room.

Looking at the current room description for the basement, the hints say to try going north or west. The user's previous actions were going south twice, so now they need to go west. The next step in the plan is to go west from the basement. The user's last action was going south to the basement, so the next command should be "go west".

Wait, but the user's last input was the basement, and the system's response was the basement description. The user's next action should be to go west as per the instructions. The user's task is to go south, then west, then south, then west again, then get the coin. So after the basement, going west would be the next step. Let me check the previous steps again.

Original instructions: head south (done), then west, then south, then west, then get coin. So after the basement, the user needs to go west. The basement's description mentions an unguarded exit to the north and west. So the correct next action is "go west".
</think>go west

-= Bedchamber =-
You are in a bedchamber. A normal one.



There is an unguarded exit to the east. There is an unblocked exit to the south.



>                                                                                                                                -= Bedchamber =-0/4

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and eventually retrieve a coin. The original goal was to go south, then west, then south again, then west, and get the coin from the spare room.

So far, the user has gone from the Canteen to the Dish-Pit, then to the Basement, then to the Bedchamber. The current room is the Bedchamber, which has an unguarded exit to the east and an unblocked exit to the south. 

The next step according to the original plan was to go west after being in the Bedchamber. Wait, but the Bedchamber's exits are east and south. There's no west exit here. Hmm, maybe the user made a mistake in the previous steps? Let me check the path again.

Original instructions: After heading south (from Canteen to Dish-Pit), then south again (to Basement), then west (to Bedchamber?), then south, then west. Wait, maybe the path is a bit different. Let me retrace:

1. Start in Canteen, go south to Dish-Pit.
2. From Dish-Pit, go south to Basement.
3. From Basement, go west to Bedchamber.
4. Then from Bedchamber, go south.
5. Then from whatever room that is, go west to get the coin.

But in the current state, the user is in the Bedchamber, which has exits east and south. So the next step should be to go south from Bedchamber. The user's next action should be "go south" to proceed. Then, after that, they might reach a room where they can go west to get the coin. The user needs to follow the sequence as per the original plan. So the next correct action is to go south from the Bedchamber.
</think>go south

-= Sauna =-
You find yourself in a sauna. A standard kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the west.



>                                                                                                                                -= Sauna =-0/5

-= Spare Room =-
You find yourself in a spare room. A typical kind of place.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a coin on the floor.


>                                                                                                                                -= Spare Room =-0/6
SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user has been moving through different rooms in the game. The original goal was to retrieve a coin from the spare room's floor. So far, they've gone south from the canteen, then south again to the basement, then west to the bedchamber, then south to the sauna, and then west to the spare room. Now, in the spare room, there's a coin on the floor. The next step should be to pick up the coin. The user's last action was moving west into the spare room, and the prompt mentions the coin is there. So the correct command would be to take the coin. But the game might require specific commands like 'take coin' or 'get coin'. Since the user has been using 'go direction' commands, maybe 'take coin' is the right action here. I need to check if the game expects that command. The previous interactions didn't mention picking up items before, so it's likely that 'take coin' is the next step. The user is close to the goal, so this should be the final action.
</think>take coin
