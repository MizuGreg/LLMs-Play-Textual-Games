I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is how to play! First step, try to venture east. Then, venture south. After that, recover the coin from the floor of the bedchamber. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Spare Room =-

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Spare Room and the Attic. They keep going east and west, which are the only exits mentioned. The original goal was to recover the coin from the bedchamber and then win. But so far, the user hasn't found the coin.

Wait, the initial instructions said to venture east, then south, then get the coin from the bedchamber. But the current room is the Attic, which has an exit to the south. Maybe the bedchamber is south of the Attic? But the user hasn't tried going south yet. However, in the current state, every time they go east, they loop back to the Spare Room, and west takes them back to the Attic. So maybe the exit to the south from the Attic is the way to go. The user has been going east and west, but the Attic's south exit is unguarded. So the next logical step is to go south from the Attic to reach the bedchamber where the coin is. The user needs to try that instead of looping between the rooms.

-= Bedchamber =-
You're now in a bedchamber.



There is an unguarded exit to the north.

There is a coin on the floor.
