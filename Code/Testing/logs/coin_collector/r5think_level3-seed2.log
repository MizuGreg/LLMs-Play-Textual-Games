It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First of all, you could, like, try to venture north. After that, head east. That done, lift the coin from the floor of the bedchamber. That's it!

-= Spare Room =-
You are in a spare room. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.



There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

>                                                                                                                                -= Spare Room =-0/1
AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go north
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. A normal one.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go east
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Bedchamber =-
You arrive in a bedchamber. An ordinary kind of place.



You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a coin on the floor.

Okay, let me think through this. The user has been moving through different rooms in the text adventure. They started in the Spare Room, went north to the Kitchen, then east to the Bedchamber. The goal mentioned earlier was to lift the coin from the floor of the bedchamber.

So far, they've reached the Bedchamber, and there's a coin on the floor. The next logical step would be to pick up the coin. The user's last action was moving east into the Bedchamber, and now they need to interact with the coin. The command should be "take coin" or "lift coin". Since the prompt says "lift the coin from the floor of the bedchamber", using "lift" might be more accurate. But in text adventures, "take" is commonly used. Wait, the original instruction said "lift the coin", so maybe "lift" is the correct verb here. Let me check the previous messages. The user was told to "lift the coin from the floor of the bedchamber. That's it!" So the final action is to lift the coin. Therefore, the next command should be "lift coin".

That's not a verb I recognise.

Okay, the user tried to lift the coin but the game said that's not a recognized verb. Hmm, maybe the correct command is different. Let me check the previous interactions.

In the Bedchamber, there's a coin on the floor. The user tried "lift coin", but the game didn't accept it. Maybe the correct verb is "pick up" instead of "lift"? Or perhaps "take"? Wait, in text adventures, common verbs are "take", "get", "pick up", "use", etc. "Lift" might not be a standard command here.

Looking back at the instructions, the user was told to "lift the coin from the floor of the bedchamber." But the game might expect a different phrasing. Maybe "take the coin" or "get the coin"? Let me think about the possible commands. The user's previous action was "go north", then "go east", then "lift coin". The game didn't accept "lift", so maybe the correct command is "take".

Alternatively, maybe the game uses "pick up" as the verb. But the user's initial instruction said "lift", so perhaps the game expects "lift" but in a different context. Wait, maybe the coin is not in a container, so the correct command is just "take coin" or "get coin". Let me check the game's possible commands. Since the user is in the Bedchamber, and the coin is on the floor, the correct action is likely "take coin" or "get coin". 

But the user tried "lift coin" and it was rejected. So maybe the correct command is "take". Let me try that. The next action should be "take coin". Alternatively, maybe "pick up coin". But the user's initial instruction said "lift", so perhaps the game expects "lift" but with the correct syntax. Wait, maybe the command is "lift the coin" instead of "lift coin". But the user tried "lift coin" and it didn't work. 

Alternatively, maybe the game uses "get" as the verb. So the correct command would be "get coin". Let me check the possible commands again. The user is in the Bedchamber, and the coin is on the floor. The correct action is to take it. So the next command should be "take coin" or "get coin". Since the user tried "lift" and it didn't work, maybe "take" is the right verb here. So the next action is "take coin".
