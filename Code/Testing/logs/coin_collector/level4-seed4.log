Welcome to another profound episode of TextWorld! Your first objective is to travel east. With that over with, venture east. And then, make an attempt to venture north. That done, recover the coin from the floor of the parlor. That's it!

-= Shower =-
You've just sauntered into a shower.



There is an unguarded exit to the east.

>                                                                                                                                -= Shower =-0/1
AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go east
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Cookery =-
You've entered a cookery. You start to take note of what's in the room.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.



>                                                                                                                                -= Cookery =-0/2
AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go east
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Pantry =-
You've just walked into a pantry. You can barely contain your excitement.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.



>                                                                                                                                -= Pantry =-0/3
AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go north
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Parlor =-
You are in a parlor. An ordinary kind of place. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.



There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

There is a coin on the floor.


>                                                                                                                                -= Parlor =-0/4
SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in the Parlor room. The goal was to travel east, then north, then get the coin from the parlor. So far, they've gone east from the shower, then east again to the pantry, then north to the parlor. Now, in the parlor, there's a coin on the floor. The next step is to pick up the coin. The user needs to pick it up, but the command has to be in the right format.

Wait, the previous action was going north to the parlor. Now, the parlor has the coin. The user's next action should be to pick up the coin. But in TextWorld, the commands are usually "take" or "get" followed by the item. So the correct command here would be "take coin" or "get coin". But the user's previous commands were "go east" and "go north", so maybe they're expected to use "take" here. Let me check the previous messages. The user was told to "recover the coin from the floor of the parlor." So the action is to pick it up. Therefore, the next command should be "take coin".
