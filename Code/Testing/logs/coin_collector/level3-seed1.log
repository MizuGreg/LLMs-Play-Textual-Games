You are now playing a fast paced episode of TextWorld! First thing I need you to do is to make an effort to move south. And then, take a trip east. Then, pick-up the coin from the floor of the studio. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Cookhouse =-
You've entered a cookhouse. The room is well lit.



There is an unblocked exit to the south.

go south

-= Spare Room =-
I am required to announce that you are now in the spare room.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a coin on the floor.
