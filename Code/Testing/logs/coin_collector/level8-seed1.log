Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an profound round of TextWorld? You do! First off, make an effort to move south. And then, take a trip east. Then, try to go north. Okay, and then, make an effort to head north. And then, head west. With that over with, attempt to move north. That done, go to the east. Then, retrieve the coin from the floor of the cookery. Got that? Good!

-= Closet =-
You are in a closet. A typical one. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."



You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Spare Room =-
You've just sauntered into a spare room. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked.

You're now in the studio.



There is an unblocked exit to the north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game called TextWorld, and they've been moving through different rooms. The goal mentioned earlier was to retrieve a coin from the cookery. So far, they've gone from the closet to the spare room, then to the studio.

In the studio, the prompt says there's an unblocked exit to the north and suggests trying west. The user is asked if they think they're on the right track and if they're close to the goal. 

Hmm, the coin is in the cookery, which I assume is a different room. The current location is the studio. The previous moves were south, then east. The next possible directions are north or west. The user needs to get to the cookery to get the coin. 

But how do they get to the cookery? The path isn't clear yet. The user might need to explore more rooms. The studio's north exit is unblocked, so maybe going north from the studio is the next step. Alternatively, west might lead to another path. But since the user is being prompted to think about their actions, they need to decide the next move.

The user's previous actions were moving south, then east. Now in the studio, the next step could be north or west. The user needs to continue moving towards the cookery. Since the cookery is a specific room, maybe the path requires moving north from the studio. But without more info, it's a bit tricky. The user should follow the directions given in the room descriptions. The studio says to try west if they need an unguarded exit, but the north is unblocked. Maybe the correct path is north. Alternatively, maybe the cookery is connected via west. But since the user is being asked if they're close, maybe they need to proceed north. Let me check the previous rooms. The spare room had east and north exits. The closet had south. So maybe the cookery is in a different part. The user needs to keep moving. The next logical step is to go north from the studio. So the answer should be "go north".

-= Cellar =-
Guess what, you are in a place we're calling a cellar. The room is well lit.



There is an unguarded exit to the north. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

You've just sauntered into a cookhouse.



There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

You find yourself in a dish-pit. A standard kind of place.

Okay, let's see. The user is navigating through different rooms in a text-based game. The goal mentioned earlier was to retrieve a coin from the cookery. So far, they've moved from the closet to the spare room, then to the studio, cellar, cookhouse, and now the dish-pit.

In the dish-pit, the prompt says to try going east or north. The user's previous action was going west, which led them here. The coin is in the cookhouse, which is south of the dish-pit. Wait, the cookhouse has an exit to the south, which is unblocked. But the user is in the dish-pit now. So maybe they need to go back to the cookhouse through the south exit? But the current room is dish-pit, and the options are east or north. Hmm.

Wait, the user's last action was go west from the cookhouse to the dish-pit. Now, in the dish-pit, the instructions say to try going east or north. If they go east, maybe they can reach the cookhouse again? Or perhaps the coin is in the cookhouse, and they need to go back. But the cookhouse is south of the dish-pit. Wait, maybe the user is in the dish-pit, and the cookhouse is to the north? Or maybe the directions are a bit confusing here.

Wait, the cookhouse is listed as having an exit to the south. So if the user is in the dish-pit, and the cookhouse is north, then going north from the dish-pit would lead back to the cookhouse. But the prompt says in the dish-pit: "You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north." So maybe both east and north are possible. But the user needs to get to the cookhouse to retrieve the coin. So perhaps going north from the dish-pit would take them back to the cookhouse. Then they can pick up the coin. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next step would be to go north from the dish-pit to reach the cookhouse again, then pick up the coin. But the user's previous action was going west, leading to the dish-pit. So the next action should be going north to get back to the cookhouse. Then, once in the cookhouse, they can retrieve the coin. So the correct next action is go north.

You've just walked into a basement.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.
