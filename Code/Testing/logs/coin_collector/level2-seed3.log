Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to venture north. And then, retrieve the coin from the floor of the basement. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Bedroom =-
You arrive in a bedroom. An ordinary kind of place. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked.

>                                                                                                                                -= Bedroom =-0/1
AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go north

-= Basement =-
You find yourself in a basement. A typical kind of place. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."



There is an unguarded exit to the south.

There is a coin on the floor.
