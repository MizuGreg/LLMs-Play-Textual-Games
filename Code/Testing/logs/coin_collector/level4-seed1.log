You are now playing a life changing round of TextWorld! First thing I need you to do is to make an effort to move south. And then, take a trip east. Then, try to go north. Okay, and then, pick up the coin from the floor of the dish-pit. Got that? Good!

-= Cookhouse =-
You've just sauntered into a cookhouse. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.



You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

AGENT -------------------------------------------------

-= Spare Room =-
You've entered a spare room. The room is well lit.



There is an unblocked exit to the east. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north.

-= Studio =-
I am required to announce that you are now in the studio.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

-= Dish-Pit =-
You find yourself in a dish-pit. A typical one. The room is well lit.



You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

There is a coin on the floor.
