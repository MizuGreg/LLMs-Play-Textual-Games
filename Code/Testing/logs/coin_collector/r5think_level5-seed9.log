I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! First of all, head south. With that accomplished, make an attempt to travel south. And then, attempt to go west. And then, move south. And then, retrieve the coin from the floor of the canteen. That's it!

-= Sauna =-
You are in a sauna. An usual kind of place. The room is well lit.



You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me think through this. The user is in a text-based game and has been moving through different rooms: sauna, spare room, basement. The goal mentioned was to retrieve a coin from the canteen's floor. So far, they've gone south from the sauna to the spare room, then south again to the basement. Now, in the basement, the prompt suggests going north or west. The user is asking if they're on the right track and what their next move should be.

First, I need to check the current room: basement. The available directions are north and west. The previous moves were south twice, so maybe the next step is to explore west. But why? The original goal is the canteen. Maybe the basement is part of the path to the canteen. Alternatively, maybe the coin is in a different room. But the user hasn't found any coins yet. 

Wait, the original instructions said to go south, then south again, then west, then retrieve the coin. But in the current room (basement), the prompt says to try going west. So maybe the next step is west. But the user is asking if they're close. The user has been following the initial directions: south, south, west. But in the basement, the prompt says to try west. So perhaps the next move is west. However, the user is in the basement, and the next step is to go west. Let me check the previous steps again.

Original instructions: head south (from sauna to spare room), then attempt to travel south (from spare room to basement), then attempt to go west (from basement?), then retrieve the coin. But in the basement, the prompt says to try going west. So maybe the next step is west. But the user is in the basement, and the next direction is west. So the next action should be go west. But the user is asking if they're on the right track. The user has followed the initial directions, so maybe they are. Therefore, the next action is go west.
</think>go west

-= Bedchamber =-
You arrive in a bedchamber. A standard kind of place. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

-= Canteen =-
You find yourself in a canteen. A typical kind of place.

There is a coin on the floor.
