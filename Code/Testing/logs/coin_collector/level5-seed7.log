SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game and has reached the Parlor again after going south from the Bedroom. The goal was to recover the coin from the bedroom's floor and then proceed to win.

So far, the player has gone through several rooms: Washroom, Lounge, Dish-Pit, Parlor, Bedroom, and back to Parlor. In the Bedroom, they found the coin on the floor. The next step was to go south to get back to the Parlor. Now, they're back in the Parlor, and the prompt says to try going north again. But the user is asking if they're making the right moves and if they're close to the goal.

Wait, the original instruction said after getting the coin from the bedroom, they'd win. But in the current state, they're back in the Parlor. Maybe the coin was picked up when they were in the Bedroom. But the game's feedback says "You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south." So maybe the player needs to go north again from the Parlor to proceed further. But the user is confused because they already got the coin. However, in the game's context, maybe the coin is part of the solution, and the next steps involve moving through the rooms again. But the user's question is whether they're on the right track. Since they've successfully retrieved the coin from the Bedroom, that's the key step. The next steps might involve moving back to the Parlor and then to the next room, but the user needs to confirm if they've done everything correctly. The correct action here is to go north again from the Parlor to continue the journey. The user's previous action was going south from the Bedroom, which brought them back to the Parlor. Now, the next logical step is to go north again to proceed further. The user might be wondering if they need to do something else, but according to the game's structure, the correct next move is to go north.
