You are now playing a fast paced round of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First off, travel east. With that over with, venture east. And then, make an attempt to venture north. That done, take a trip west. With that accomplished, make an attempt to take a trip north. Following that, make an attempt to go to the north. And then, take a trip north. And then, pick-up the coin from the floor of the canteen. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Shower =-
You are in a shower. An ordinary kind of place. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Cookery =-
You are in a cookery. An ordinary kind of place. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

You are in a pantry. A typical one.



There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game where they have to navigate through different rooms and perform specific actions to win. The initial instructions mentioned going east, then north, west, north again, and finally picking up a coin in the canteen.

So far, the user has been in the Shower, then the Cookery, and now the Pantry. The current room is the Pantry, which has an unblocked exit to the north and a west exit. The user's next step should be to go north as per the original instructions. The user is asking if they're on the right track and if they're close to the goal. 

Looking at the path: Shower → Cookery → Pantry. The next step in the original plan was to go north from the pantry. Then, after that, they needed to go west, then north again, and finally pick up the coin. So, going north from the pantry makes sense. The user has already gone east twice, which matches the first part of the instructions. Now, moving north from the pantry would be the next logical step. The user is probably close because they've followed the initial directions correctly. The next steps after the pantry would be moving west and then north again, then collecting the coin. So the correct action here is to go north.
</think>go north

-= Parlor =-
Guess what, you are in a place we're calling a parlor. The room is well lit.



You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.



>                                                                                                                                -= Parlor =-0/4

-= Cookhouse =-
You've entered a cookhouse. You begin looking for stuff.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded.



>                                                                                                                                -= Cookhouse =-0/5

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game and has been moving through different rooms. The goal is to pick up a coin from the canteen and then win. So far, they've gone from the shower to the cookery, then to the pantry, parlor, and now the cookhouse.

The current room is the cookhouse. The clues here say there's an exit to the north and建议 going east. The user's previous action was going west from the parlor to the cookhouse. Now, they need to continue following the path towards the canteen. Since the original plan was to go east, then north, then west, then north again, maybe the next step is to go north from the cookhouse. But the prompt says to follow the original steps: after the cookhouse, the next was to take a trip north. Wait, the original instructions said after the cookhouse, make an attempt to go north. So the next action should be going north from the cookhouse. Let me check the previous steps again.

Original plan: go east (shower -> cookery), then north (cookery -> pantry), then west (pantry -> parlor), then north (parlor -> cookhouse?), then north again from cookhouse. Wait, maybe the path is a loop. But the user is now in the cookhouse. The next step according to the original plan was to take a trip north. So the next command should be "go north" again. But the cookhouse's description says there's an exit to the north. So that's the direction to go. Then, after reaching the next room, maybe the canteen is there. So the next action is go north.
</think>go north

-= Cellar =-
This is going to sound unbelievable, but you've just entered a cellar.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.



>                                                                                                                                -= Cellar =-0/6

-= Kitchenette =-
You find yourself in a kitchenette. A typical one. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.



>                                                                                                                                -= Kitchenette =-0/7
SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game where they have to navigate through different rooms and eventually pick up a coin in the canteen to win. The current room is the Kitchenette, and the instructions mention going north or south.

Looking back at the previous steps, the player has been moving east, then north, west, north again, and now in the Kitchenette. The goal is to reach the canteen, pick up the coin, and win. The user is asking if they're on the right track and close to the goal.

The Kitchenette's description says to try going north or south. The previous rooms included a pantry, parlor, cookhouse, cellar, and now kitchenette. The canteen hasn't been mentioned yet. The user needs to find the canteen, pick up the coin. So maybe the next step is to go north from the Kitchenette, as the instruction suggests. Alternatively, maybe south. But the user's previous actions have been mostly north. Let me check the path again.

From the Shower (east) -> Cookery (east) -> Pantry (north) -> Parlor (west) -> Cookhouse (north) -> Cellar (north) -> Kitchenette (now). So the path is moving through different areas. The canteen is probably in a different direction. The user needs to find the canteen. Since the original instructions mentioned going east, then north, west, north, etc., maybe the canteen is in the north from the Kitchenette. But the Kitchenette's description says north is unblocked. So perhaps go north again. Alternatively, maybe south. But the user's previous steps have been moving north a lot. Let me think. The original plan was to go east, then north, west, north, etc. So maybe the canteen is in the north from the Kitchenette. So the next action would be go north. But the user is asking if they're close. The current room is Kitchenette, and the next step is to go north or south. The user needs to reach the canteen. If the canteen is in the north, then go north. But the user might need to check. However, the user is supposed to follow the original plan. The original plan said after the initial steps, pick up the coin from the canteen. So the user needs to reach the canteen. The current room is Kitchenette. The next step is to go north or south. The user's previous steps have been moving north. So perhaps the next step is north again. But the user is in the Kitchenette, and the description says north is unblocked. So go north. Then maybe reach the canteen. Alternatively, maybe the canteen is in the south. But the user's path has been moving north. Maybe the canteen is in the north. So the next action is go north.

-= Canteen =-
You find yourself in a canteen. A typical one.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

There is a coin on the floor.
