SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text adventure game. Their goal is to navigate through various rooms, move in specific directions, and eventually pick up a coin in a vault. So far, they've moved from the closet south to the spare room, then east to the studio, north to the cellar, then north again to the cookhouse, south back to the cellar, and then north again to the cookhouse again. The current room is the cookhouse, and the prompt says to try going south or west.

The user is asking if they're making the right moves and if they're close to the goal. Let me recap the path. The original instructions were: move south, then east, then north, then north again, then west, then north, then pick up the coin. But the user's path so far has them looping between the cellar and cookhouse. Maybe they're getting stuck in a loop. 

Looking at the current room, the cookhouse, the exits are south and west. The user needs to get to the vault to pick up the coin. Maybe the vault is in a different direction. Let me check the previous rooms. The studio had exits north and west. The cellar had south and north. The cookhouse is now the current room. Maybe the vault is in the west direction from the cookhouse? Or perhaps the user needs to go west from the cookhouse. Let me think.

In the cookhouse, the user is told to try going south or west. If they go west, maybe that leads to another room. The user's previous moves have them going back and forth between cellar and cookhouse. Maybe they need to find a different path. Let's see, the original plan was after moving north, then west, then north again. But the user hasn't gone west yet. The current room is cookhouse, so maybe going west from here is the next step. Let's check the previous steps. 

In the cookhouse (room 5), the user was told to go south or west. The user's last action was going north to the cookhouse again (room 7). So now, the next step should be to go west from the cookhouse. That would be the next logical move to progress towards the vault. So the correct action here is to go west.
</think>go west
