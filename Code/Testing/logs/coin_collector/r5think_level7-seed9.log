SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in a sauna, and they tried to go south but couldn't. The previous actions were moving through different rooms: canteen, dish-pit, basement, bedchamber, and now the sauna. The goal is to lift the coin in the garage and win.

So, the current room is the sauna. The possible exits are north and west, as per the description. The user tried going south but it's blocked. The original plan was to go south, then west, then south again, then west, then south, then pick up the coin. But maybe the path is different.

Wait, the user's previous steps: they went south from the canteen, then south again to the dish-pit, then north to the basement, then south back to dish-pit, then west to bedchamber, then south to sauna. Now, in the sauna, they can't go south. So maybe the next step is to check the other exits. The sauna has an exit to the north and west. The user needs to find the garage where the coin is. Maybe the garage is connected through the west exit from the sauna? Or perhaps the coin is in a room that's accessible from the basement or bedchamber.

Alternatively, maybe the correct path is to go west from the sauna. Let's check the previous rooms. The bedchamber had a south exit to the sauna. The sauna's west exit might lead to another room. If the user goes west from the sauna, they might reach a room that's closer to the garage. Alternatively, going north from the sauna would take them back to the bedchamber. But the user needs to get to the garage. Maybe the garage is in the basement? But the basement had a west exit. Wait, the basement's west exit was mentioned as unblocked. Maybe the user needs to go west from the basement, but they were in the sauna. So perhaps the correct path is to go west from the sauna, then proceed through other rooms to reach the garage where the coin is.

So the next action should be to go west from the sauna. That's the only possible exit besides north, which would take them back. So the user should try going west.
