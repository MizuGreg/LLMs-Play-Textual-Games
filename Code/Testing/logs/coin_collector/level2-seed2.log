Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, you could, like, try to venture north. After that, recover the coin from the floor of the kitchen. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Bedchamber =-
You've entered a bedchamber. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north.

-= Kitchen =-
You've just sauntered into a kitchen. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.



You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a coin on the floor.
