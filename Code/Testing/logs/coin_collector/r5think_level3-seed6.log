I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, make an attempt to take a trip south. With that done, make an effort to venture east. Once you get around to doing that, pick-up the coin from the floor of the sauna. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Lounge =-
You arrive in a lounge. You begin looking for stuff.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

-= Basement =-
You've just walked into a basement.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Sauna =-
You've just sauntered into a sauna. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."



There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

There is a coin on the floor.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me figure out what to do next. The user is in the Sauna room. The goal is to pick up the coin and then win. The previous steps were going south to the Basement, then east to the Sauna. Now, in the Sauna, there's a coin on the floor. The user needs to pick it up.

The prompt says to pick up the coin from the floor of the sauna. So the next action should be to take the coin. The command would be "take coin" or "pick up coin". But in TextWorld, the correct command might be "take coin". Let me check the previous interactions. The user was told there's a coin on the floor, so the next step is to pick it up. The answer should be "take coin".
</think>take coin
