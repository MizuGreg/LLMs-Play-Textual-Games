I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, make an attempt to take a trip south. With that done, make an effort to venture east. Once you get around to doing that, pick-up the coin from the floor of the sauna. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Lounge =-
You arrive in a lounge. You begin looking for stuff.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.
