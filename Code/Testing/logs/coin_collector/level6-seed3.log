Welcome to TextWorld! First off, venture north. And then, take a trip east. Then, move east. After that, make an effort to take a trip south. Okay, and then, take a trip west. And then, pick up the coin from the floor of the laundromat. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Bar =-
You've entered a bar.



There is an unguarded exit to the north.

-= Basement =-
Ah, the basement. This is some kind of basement, really great normal vibes in this place, a wonderful normal atmosphere. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game called TextWorld. The goal seems to be to navigate through different rooms and eventually pick up a coin from the laundromat. The user has been moving north, then east, then east again, and now they're in the Kitchenette. The next steps mentioned in the initial instructions were to go south, then west, and then pick up the coin.

Looking at the current room, the Kitchenette has an exit to the south and west. The user's last action was "go east" from the Bedroom to get here. Now, according to the plan, after being in the Kitchenette, the next step should be to go south. But wait, the user is asking if they're on the right track and what their next move should be.

The user's current location is the Kitchenette. The exits here are south and west. The original plan was to go south from the Kitchenette. But the user is asking if they're close to the goal. Let me check the previous steps again. The initial instructions said: venture north, then east, then east, then south, then west, then pick up the coin. So after the Kitchenette, the next step should be south to return to the Basement, then west to the Bar, but wait, the user already went north from the Bar to the Basement. Hmm, maybe the path is a loop.

Wait, the user is in the Kitchenette. The exit to the south would take them back to the Basement. Then from the Basement, the exit to the west would take them back to the Bar. But the original plan was to go west after going south. But the user's current position is Kitchenette. So the next step should be south to go back to the Basement. Then from there, west to the Bar. But the user might have already been there. Alternatively, maybe the coin is in the laundromat, which is a different location. The user needs to find the laundromat, pick up the coin, and then stop.

But the current rooms are Bar, Basement, Bedroom, Kitchenette. The laundromat hasn't been mentioned yet. Maybe the user hasn't reached the laundromat yet. The initial instructions said to pick up the coin from the laundromat's floor. So perhaps the laundromat is another room that the user hasn't visited yet. The user's current path is going through the basement, bedroom, kitchenette. Maybe the next steps involve moving south from the Kitchenette to the Basement, then west to the Bar, but that's where they started. Alternatively, maybe there's another exit.

Wait, in the Kitchenette, the exits are south and west. The user needs to go south to the Basement. Then, in the Basement, the exits are east and south. Wait, the Basement's description says there's an unguarded exit to the east and south. So from the Basement, going south would take them to another room. But the user's initial steps were to go north from the Bar to the Basement, then east to the Bedroom, then east again to the Kitchenette. Now, from the Kitchenette, going south would take them back to the Basement. Then, from the Basement, going south again would take them to another room. But the user's goal is to reach the laundromat and pick up the coin. Maybe the laundromat is in a different part of the map.

Alternatively, perhaps the user needs to go west from the Kitchenette. The Kitchenette has a west exit. Going west from the Kitchenette would take them back to the Bedroom. Then, from the Bedroom, east or west. But the user's plan was to go south from the Kitchenette. But the user is asking if they're close to the goal. Since the coin is in the laundromat, which hasn't been visited yet, the user needs to find that room. The current path hasn't reached the laundromat yet. So maybe the next step is to go south from the Kitchenette to the Basement, then perhaps east or west to find the laundromat. Alternatively, maybe the laundromat is in the Bar or another room.

Wait, the initial instruction said to "pick up the coin from the floor of the laundromat." So the laundromat is a specific room. The user hasn't been there yet. The current path is through the Bar, Basement, Bedroom, Kitchenette. The laundromat might be a different room. The user needs to navigate to it. The next step is to go south from the Kitchenette to the Basement. Then, from the Basement, maybe go east to the Bedroom again, but that's where they came from. Alternatively, maybe from the Basement, go south to another room. But the Basement's description says there's an exit to the east and south. So going south from the Basement would take them to another room. Maybe that's where the laundromat is.

But the user's current position is the Kitchenette. The next step should be to go south to the Basement. Then, from the Basement, go south again to reach the laundromat. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action should be to go south from the Kitchenette. However, the user is asking if they're close to the goal. Since they haven't reached the laundromat yet, they might not be. So the correct next step is to go south from the Kitchenette to the Basement, then proceed further south to reach the laundromat. But according to the initial plan, after going east from the Kitchenette, the next step was to go south. Wait, the initial instructions said: after moving east twice, then take a trip south. So the user is in the Kitchenette, which is after two east moves. Then, the next step is to go south. So the user should go south from the Kitchenette to the Basement. Then, from the Basement, go west to the Bar, but that's where they started. Alternatively, from the Basement, go south to another room. But the user's plan was to go south, then west. So after going south from the Kitchenette, they would be in the Basement, then go west to the Bar. But the Bar is already visited. Maybe the laundromat is in a different part.

Alternatively, maybe the laundromat is in the Bedroom or Kitchenette. But the user hasn't found it yet. The user needs to proceed to the laundromat. So the next step is to go south from the Kitchenette to the Basement. Then, from the Basement, go south again to reach the laundromat. But the user hasn't done that yet. Therefore, the next action should be to go south.

-= Shower =-
You're now in the shower.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.
