Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to make an attempt to take a trip south. With that done, make an effort to venture east. Once you get around to doing that, go south. And then, go to the east. Then, make an effort to head north. And then, head east. And then, recover the coin from the floor of the kitchenette. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user has been moving through different rooms in the text-based game. The goal is to recover the coin from the kitchenette floor. So far, they've gone south from the recreation zone into the basement, then east to the sauna, south again to the cookhouse, and then east to the lounge. Now they're in the lounge, which has exits to the north and west.

The user is asking if they're on the right track and if they're close to the coin. The previous steps have taken them through various areas, but the kitchenette hasn't been mentioned yet. The coin is in the kitchenette, so they need to find that room.

Looking at the current location, the lounge has north and west exits. Let's check the previous rooms. The cookhouse had a north exit (which led to the lounge) and an east exit (which was taken to get to the lounge). The sauna had a south exit to the cookhouse. The basement had a north exit to the sauna. The recreation zone had a south exit to the basement.

So, to get to the kitchenette, maybe they need to go west from the lounge? But the lounge's west exit hasn't been explored yet. Alternatively, maybe the cookhouse has a different exit. Wait, the cookhouse had a north exit to the lounge and an east exit (which was used to get to the lounge). But the cookhouse might have other exits. However, the user hasn't checked the west or south from the cookhouse.

Alternatively, maybe the kitchenette is connected to the cookhouse or the basement. But the user hasn't checked those areas yet. Since the current location is the lounge, the next step would be to check the west exit. If they go west from the lounge, they might reach a different area. Alternatively, going north from the lounge would take them back to the cookhouse.

But the user's goal is the kitchenette. So perhaps the cookhouse is connected to the kitchenette. Let me think. The cookhouse was mentioned as a place where the user is now. If the user goes west from the lounge, maybe they can reach the cookhouse again, then check other exits. Alternatively, maybe the kitchenette is in the basement or another area.

Wait, the user's previous steps were: recreation zone (south) -> basement (east) -> sauna (south) -> cookhouse (east) -> lounge. So the cookhouse is now connected to the lounge. Maybe the cookhouse has a south exit leading to the kitchenette? Or perhaps the basement has a connection.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west from the lounge. Let's check the current room description again. The lounge has exits to the north and west. The user hasn't checked the west exit yet. If they go west, they might reach the cookhouse again. Then, from the cookhouse, maybe there's a south exit to the kitchenette. But the cookhouse's description said there's an exit to the north (which is the lounge) and an unguarded exit to the north. Wait, the cookhouse's description said: "There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded." So the cookhouse has a north exit to the lounge. But what about other directions? The user might need to check the south or west from the cookhouse.

Alternatively, maybe the kitchenette is in the basement. The basement had a north exit to the sauna. But the user hasn't checked the other directions from the basement. However, the user is now in the lounge, so perhaps the next step is to go west from the lounge to the cookhouse again, then check other exits.

But the user is asking if they're close. Since the coin is in the kitchenette, and the user hasn't reached that yet, they need to continue exploring. The next logical step would be to go west from the lounge to the cookhouse, then check other exits. Alternatively, maybe the kitchenette is connected to the cookhouse. So the user should go west from the lounge to the cookhouse, then check south or west from there.

But the user's next action should be based on the current room. The lounge has west and north exits. The user hasn't checked the west exit yet. So the next step would be to go west to the cookhouse again, then explore further. Alternatively, maybe the user should go north back to the cookhouse, but that's already been done.

Wait, the user is in the lounge. The previous step was going east to the lounge from the cookhouse. So the cookhouse is to the north of the lounge. So if the user goes west from the lounge, they would return to the cookhouse. Then, from the cookhouse, maybe there's a south exit to the kitchenette. But the cookhouse's description didn't mention that. The cookhouse's description said there's an exit to the north (unguarded) and an unblocked exit to the east (which was used to get to the lounge). So maybe the cookhouse has a south exit. But the user hasn't checked that yet.

So the next step would be to go west from the lounge to the cookhouse, then check the south exit. Alternatively, maybe the user should go north from the lounge to the cookhouse again, but that's already been done. Wait, the user is in the lounge, so going west would take them back to the cookhouse. Then, from the cookhouse, check south. If that leads to the kitchenette, then the user can proceed.

Alternatively, maybe the user should go north from the lounge to the cookhouse again, but that's already been done. The user's next action should be to go west from the lounge to the cookhouse, then check the south exit. So the next command would be "go west".

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game and has been moving around different rooms. The original goal was to take a trip south, then east, then south again, east again, then north, east again, and finally recover the coin from the kitchenette.

So far, the user has gone south from the recreation zone to the basement, then east to the sauna, south to the cookhouse, east to the lounge, west back to the cookhouse, and then east back to the lounge. The current location is the lounge again. The user is asking if they're on the right track and close to the goal.

Looking at the path: The initial directions were to go south, east, south, east, north, east, then get the coin. But in the current path, they've looped between the lounge and cookhouse. Maybe they need to check if the kitchenette is nearby. The coin is in the kitchenette's floor, so perhaps the user needs to find the kitchenette. 

The lounge has exits to north and west. The cookhouse has exits to east and north. Maybe the user needs to go north from the lounge to reach the cookhouse again, then find a way to the kitchenette. Alternatively, maybe the kitchenette is in a different part of the map. Since the user has been moving between these areas, perhaps they need to continue exploring north from the lounge. But the user's last action was going east from the cookhouse back to the lounge. Maybe the next step is to go north from the lounge to reach the cookhouse again, then check if there's a path to the kitchenette. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west from the lounge to the cookhouse again and then proceed further. But the user's goal is to get the coin, so they need to find the kitchenette. Maybe the kitchenette is in the cookhouse or connected through another path. The user might need to check the cookhouse's north exit, which was mentioned as unguarded. Alternatively, maybe the kitchenette is in the basement or sauna. But the user hasn't explored those areas yet. Wait, the original path included going south, east, south, east, north, east. So after the initial steps, the user might have reached a point where they can go north from the lounge to the cookhouse again, then east to the kitchenette. But the user is currently in the lounge, so going north would take them back to the cookhouse. Then from there, maybe east again? But the cookhouse's east exit leads to the lounge. Hmm, maybe there's a different path. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west from the lounge to the cookhouse, then north to the basement, but the basement's north exit is unguarded. But the original goal was to get the coin from the kitchenette. Maybe the user needs to find the kitchenette through the cookhouse or another area. Since the user is stuck looping between the lounge and cookhouse, perhaps they need to go north from the lounge to the cookhouse again, then check the north exit of the cookhouse. Wait, the cookhouse has an exit to the north. So from the cookhouse, going north would take them to the basement? But the basement's north exit is unguarded. Alternatively, maybe the kitchenette is in the cookhouse. The user needs to look for the coin in the kitchenette's floor. Maybe the user needs to check the cookhouse's areas. But the user hasn't found the coin yet. So perhaps the next step is to go north from the lounge to the cookhouse again, then check if there's a way to the kitchenette. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east from the cookhouse again, but that leads back to the lounge. This is a bit confusing. The user might need to continue exploring the cookhouse and check for the coin. But the coin is in the kitchenette, so maybe the user needs to find the kitchenette. Since the user is in the lounge, maybe the next step is to go north to the cookhouse, then check if there's a path to the kitchenette. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west from the lounge to the cookhouse again and then proceed. The user's next action should be to go north from the lounge to the cookhouse again, then check the north exit. But the user is currently in the lounge, so the next command would be "go north".

-= Workshop =-
I am required to announce that you are now in the workshop. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in this text-based game. Their goal is to eventually recover the coin from the kitchenette. Let me track their path so far.

Starting from the Recreation Zone, they went south to the Basement, then east to the Sauna, south again to the Cookhouse, east to the Lounge, west back to the Cookhouse, east to the Lounge again, then north to the Workshop. 

Now, in the Workshop, the提示 says to try going east or south. The user's next move would be to follow the path that leads towards the kitchenette. Since the original plan was to go south, then east, then north, then east again, maybe the Workshop is part of that path. 

But the user's goal is to get to the kitchenette's floor. The Workshop might be a part of the path leading towards the kitchen. So, the next step should be to go east from the Workshop, as that's the direction mentioned. Alternatively, maybe south, but the user's previous steps have been moving east and south in a pattern. 

Wait, the original instructions were: go south, then east, then south, then east, then north, then east. But the user has already done some of those steps. Now in the Workshop, the next logical step might be east to continue moving towards the kitchenette. Let me check the previous steps again. 

The user's path has them moving through various rooms, and the Workshop is a new area. The提示 says to try east or south. Since the user's goal is to reach the kitchenette, which is likely in a different part of the map, maybe east is the right direction. So the next action should be go east.

Well I'll be, you are in the place we're calling the kitchenette. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

There is a coin on the floor.
