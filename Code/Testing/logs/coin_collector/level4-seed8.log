Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. Your first objective is to go to the east. Following that, attempt to go south. After that, take a trip east. Then, pick up the coin from the floor of the attic. Got that? Good!

-= Study =-
Well, here we are in a study. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked.
