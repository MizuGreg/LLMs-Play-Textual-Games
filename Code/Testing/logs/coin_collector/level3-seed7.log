Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First step, go south. Next, make an attempt to venture east. And then, pick up the coin from the floor of the dish-pit. Got that? Good!

-= Washroom =-
You've entered a washroom.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

-= Lounge =-
Well, here we are in a lounge. Let's see what's in here.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go east

-= Dish-Pit =-
You are in a dish-pit. A typical one.



There is an unblocked exit to the west.

There is a coin on the floor.


>                                                                                                                                -= Dish-Pit =-0/3
SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me think through this. The user has been moving through different rooms in TextWorld. They started in the Washroom, went south to the Lounge, then east to the Dish-Pit. The current room is the Dish-Pit, where there's a coin on the floor. The task was to pick up the coin from the dish-pit.

So far, the user has followed the instructions correctly: first go south, then east, which led them to the Dish-Pit. The next step mentioned in the initial task was to pick up the coin. The user is now in the Dish-Pit, and the coin is on the floor. The prompt says to pick it up. The user hasn't done that yet. The previous actions were moving, so the next logical step is to pick up the coin. The response should be "pick up coin" to complete the task. The user is close to reaching the goal, so the next action is straightforward.
