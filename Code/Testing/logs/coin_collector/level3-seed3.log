Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an life changing round of TextWorld? You do! First step, venture north. And then, take a trip east. Then, retrieve the coin from the floor of the bedroom. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Kitchenette =-
I am sorry to announce that you are now in the kitchenette. You begin looking for stuff.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Basement =-
You find yourself in a basement. An usual kind of place.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

-= Bedroom =-
You find yourself in a bedroom. A typical kind of place. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."



There is an unguarded exit to the west.

There is a coin on the floor.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me figure out what to do next. The user is in the Bedroom scene. The goal is to retrieve the coin from the floor and then win. The current state says there's a coin on the floor and an unguarded exit to the west.

The user has already gone north from the Kitchenette to the Basement, then east to the Bedroom. Now, in the Bedroom, they need to pick up the coin. The next step would be to take the coin. But the command format needs to be in the form of a direction or action. Since the coin is on the floor, the correct action is to pick it up. However, in TextWorld-style games, sometimes you have to use specific commands like 'take coin' or 'get coin'. But the previous actions were 'go north' and 'go east', so maybe the expected command here is 'take coin' or 'get coin'. Alternatively, since the coin is on the floor, maybe the player needs to 'pick up the coin'. But the user's previous actions were directional, so perhaps the correct command here is 'take coin' or 'get coin'. Let me check the previous interactions. The user was told to "retrieve the coin from the floor of the bedroom." So the next action should be to take the coin. The correct command would be 'take coin' or 'get coin'. But in the context of the game, maybe 'take coin' is the right command. So the next action is to take the coin.
