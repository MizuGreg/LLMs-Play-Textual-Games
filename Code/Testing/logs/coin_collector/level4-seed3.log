Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an life changing round of TextWorld? You do! First step, venture north. And then, take a trip east. Then, move east. After that, retrieve the coin from the floor of the kitchenette. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Shower =-
You find yourself in a shower. An ordinary kind of place. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.



There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Basement =-
A well framed signboard tells you that you are now in the basement. Let's see what's in here.



There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

-= Bedroom =-
Well how about that, you are in the place we're calling the bedroom.



There is an unblocked exit to the east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.



>                                                                                                                                -= Bedroom =-0/3

-= Kitchenette =-
Ah, the kitchenette. This is some kind of kitchenette, really great normal vibes in this place, a wonderful normal atmosphere. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.



You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a coin on the floor.


>                                                                                                                                -= Kitchenette =-0/4
