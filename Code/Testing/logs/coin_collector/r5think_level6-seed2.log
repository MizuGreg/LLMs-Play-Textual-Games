Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First thing I need you to do is to try to venture north. After that, head east. That done, go to the east. Next, attempt to travel north. And then, travel west. That done, retrieve the coin from the floor of the bar. And once you've done that, you win!

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north.
