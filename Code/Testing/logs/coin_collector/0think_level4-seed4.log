Welcome to another profound episode of TextWorld! Your first objective is to travel east. With that over with, venture east. And then, make an attempt to venture north. That done, recover the coin from the floor of the parlor. That's it!

-= Shower =-
You've just sauntered into a shower.



There is an unguarded exit to the east.

>                                                                                                                                -= Shower =-0/1
AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go east
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Cookery =-
You've entered a cookery. You start to take note of what's in the room.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.



>                                                                                                                                -= Cookery =-0/2
AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go east
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Pantry =-
You've just walked into a pantry. You can barely contain your excitement.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.



>                                                                                                                                -= Pantry =-0/3
AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go north
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Parlor =-
You are in a parlor. An ordinary kind of place. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.



There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

There is a coin on the floor.


>                                                                                                                                -= Parlor =-0/4
AGENT -------------------------------------------------
pick up coin
