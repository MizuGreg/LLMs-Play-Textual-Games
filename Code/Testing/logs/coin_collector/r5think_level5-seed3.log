Welcome to TextWorld! First off, venture north. And then, take a trip east. Then, move east. After that, make an effort to take a trip south. Okay, and then, pick up the coin from the floor of the laundromat. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Shower =-
You've just shown up in a shower.



There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Basement =-
I am sorry to announce that you are now in the basement. You begin looking for stuff.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

-= Bedroom =-
You find yourself in a bedroom. An usual kind of place.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me think through this. The user has been moving through different rooms in TextWorld: first the shower, then the basement, and now the bedroom. The instructions mentioned venturing north, then east twice, then south, and picking up a coin in the laundromat. 

Wait, the current room is the bedroom. The user's next steps according to the initial instructions were after going east twice. Wait, the first move was north from the shower, then east from the basement, then the user is now in the bedroom. The next step in the original plan was to move east again. But in the bedroom, the available exits are east and west. The user's previous action was going east from the basement to get here. So maybe the next step is to go east again from the bedroom. But the user is asking if they're on the right track and if they're close to the goal. 

The original goal was to pick up the coin in the laundromat. So far, the user has moved through shower → basement → bedroom. The laundromat hasn't been mentioned yet. Maybe the next step is to go south from the bedroom, as per the initial instructions. Wait, the initial instructions said after moving east twice, then take a trip south. Wait, the user went north first, then east (basement to bedroom), then maybe another east? But in the bedroom, the east exit is unblocked. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go south from the bedroom. Let me check the room descriptions again.

In the bedroom, the prompt says: "You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west." So the user can go east or west. The initial plan was to go north, then east, then east again, then south. But after the first east (from basement to bedroom), the next step would be east again? But the user is now in the bedroom. If they go east from the bedroom, maybe they'll reach another room. Alternatively, maybe the user should go south from the bedroom. But the original plan said after moving east twice, then south. So perhaps the user needs to go east again from the bedroom, then south. But the user is asking if they're on the right track. 

Alternatively, maybe the laundromat is in a different location. The initial instruction mentioned picking up the coin from the laundromat. So perhaps the user needs to find the laundromat. But the current rooms are shower, basement, bedroom. Maybe the laundromat is in another area. The user's next move should follow the initial plan: after going east twice (from basement to bedroom), then move south. So from the bedroom, go south. Let me check the room descriptions again. The bedroom's description says that if you need an unblocked exit, go east. If you need an unguarded exit, go west. So maybe the south exit is blocked? Or maybe the user needs to go east again. Wait, the initial plan was to go north, then east, then east, then south. So after the first two moves (north, east), the user is in the basement. Then the next move was east to get to the bedroom. Then the next step in the plan is to move east again. But in the bedroom, the east exit is available. So going east from the bedroom would be the next step. Then, after that, the plan is to go south. So the user should go east again, then south. But the user is asking if they're close. So maybe the user is on the right track. The next action would be to go east again from the bedroom. But the user is in the bedroom now, and the next step according to the initial plan is to move east again. So the answer should be "go east".

-= Kitchenette =-
You find yourself in a standard kind of place. That is to say, you're in a kitchenette. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?



You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

I am sorry to announce that you are now in the laundromat.



There is an unblocked exit to the north.

There is a coin on the floor.
