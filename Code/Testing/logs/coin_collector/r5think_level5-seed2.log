It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First stop, try to venture north. After that, head east. That done, go to the east. Next, attempt to travel north. And then, pick up the coin from the floor of the bar. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Workshop =-
You find yourself in a workshop. An usual kind of place. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.



There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

-= Bedchamber =-
You arrive in a bedchamber. An usual one.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

-= Spare Room =-
Well, here we are in the spare room.



There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game and has been moving through different rooms: Workshop, Kitchen, Bedchamber, and now Spare Room. The goal mentioned earlier was to pick up a coin from the bar's floor after moving north, east, etc.

So far, the user has gone north from the workshop, then east to the kitchen, then east again to the bedchamber, and then east once more to the spare room. The current room is the Spare Room, which has an exit to the north and west. The user is asking if they're on the right track and if they're close to the goal.

Hmm, the original path mentioned was: go north (workshop to kitchen), then east (kitchen to bedchamber), then north again (maybe from bedchamber to somewhere else?), then pick up the coin in the bar. But the user's current location is the Spare Room. Maybe the next step is to go north from the Spare Room, which would take them to the next room. But the goal is to reach the bar and pick up the coin. So perhaps the user needs to check if the next room (north from Spare Room) is the bar or leads closer to it. Alternatively, maybe the coin is in the Spare Room, but the instruction said to pick it up from the bar's floor. So maybe the user needs to continue moving north from the Spare Room to reach the bar. The user should go north again.

-= Bar =-
You've just sauntered into a bar.



You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

There is a coin on the floor.
