Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an life changing round of TextWorld? You do! Here is your task for today. First thing I need you to do is to make an effort to move south. And then, retrieve the coin from the floor of the spare room. Alright, thanks!

-= Studio =-
You've just shown up in a studio. You start to take note of what's in the room.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

-= Spare Room =-
I am sorry to announce that you are now in the spare room. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.



There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

There is a coin on the floor.

You can't see any such thing.
