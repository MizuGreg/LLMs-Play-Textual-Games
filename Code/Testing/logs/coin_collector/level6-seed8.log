Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First off, go to the east. Following that, attempt to go south. After that, take a trip east. Then, attempt to move east. Okay, and then, make an attempt to go north. Once you manage that, retrieve the coin from the floor of the bedroom. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Study =-
I am sorry to announce that you are now in the study. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east.

You're now in a cubicle. You begin to take stock of what's here.



There is an unblocked exit to the south. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

Well, here we are in the office.



There is an unblocked exit to the east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.

You're not going to believe this, but you've just entered an attic.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game and has followed a set of instructions to move through different rooms. The goal is to eventually get the coin from the bedroom and win. So far, they've gone from the Study to the Cubicle, then to the Office, and then to the Attic. Each time, there's an exit in a certain direction, and the prompts suggest moving in those directions.

Now, the current room is the Attic. The prompt says there's an exit to the east, which is unguarded, and also mentions trying to go west, which is unblocked. The user's last action was "go east" from the Attic, but the next step would be to check the directions again. Wait, no—the user's last action was "go east" from the Attic, but the response didn't show a new room. Wait, looking back: the user's last input was "go east" from the Attic, and the response was the Attic's description again. So maybe the user is stuck in the Attic, or maybe the next step is to try moving west from the Attic. But the user's next action is to decide whether to go east again or west. 

The original instructions said after going east three times (Study → Cubicle → Office → Attic), then attempt to move east again. But the Attic's east exit is mentioned. So maybe the next step is to go east again from the Attic. However, the user is being asked if they think they're making the right moves and if they're close to the goal. The user is in the Attic, and the next step would be to go east again. But the original plan was to go east, then south, then east, then east, then north. Wait, let me check the original task again.

Original task: First, go east (Study → Cubicle). Then attempt to go south (from Cubicle to Office? Wait, the Cubicle's exit is south to the Office? Wait, the Cubicle's description says there's an unblocked exit to the south. So from Cubicle, going south leads to Office. Then, from Office, the exit is east. Then, take a trip east (from Office to Attic). Then attempt to move east again (from Attic, east is the next exit). Then, after that, make an attempt to go north. So after moving east from Attic, the next step would be to go north. But the user is now in the Attic, and the next action is to go east again. Wait, maybe the user is in the Attic and needs to go east again. But the Attic's east exit is unguarded, so going east from Attic would take them to another room. Then, after that, they need to go north. 

But the user is being asked if they think they're making the right moves. The user is in the Attic, and the next step is to go east again. However, the user might be confused. Alternatively, maybe the correct path is to go west from the Attic. But the original plan was to go east three times. Wait, the original instructions said: go east (Study → Cubicle), then attempt to go south (Cubicle → Office), then take a trip east (Office → Attic), then attempt to move east (Attic → ?), then go north. So after the Attic, moving east would be the next step. So the user is in the Attic, and the next action is to go east again. But the user's last action was "go east" from the Attic, and the response was the Attic's description again. That suggests that maybe the user is in a loop, or perhaps the Attic's east exit leads to another room. But the user hasn't moved east yet. Wait, maybe the user is supposed to go east from the Attic, which would take them to another room. Then, from there, they can go north. 

So the next action should be to go east from the Attic. But the user is being asked if they think they're making the right moves. The user is in the Attic, and the next step is to go east again. Therefore, the correct command is "go east".

You find yourself in a recreation zone. A standard kind of place. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.
