It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, you could, like, head south. With that accomplished, make an attempt to travel south. And then, recover the coin from the floor of the sauna. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Basement =-
You find yourself in a basement. A normal one. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.



There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Bedchamber =-
You have moved into the most normal of all possible bedchambers.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

-= Sauna =-
You arrive in a sauna. A standard kind of place. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a coin on the floor.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me think through this. The user is in the Sauna room, which is part of the TextWorld game. The goal is to recover the coin from the floor of the sauna and then win. So far, they've gone from the Basement to the Bedchamber and then to the Sauna. The Sauna has a coin on the floor.

The next step would be to pick up the coin. But the user's last action was "go south" which led them to the Sauna. Now, they need to interact with the coin. Since the coin is on the floor, the correct action would be to pick it up. However, in TextWorld, the commands are usually things like "take coin" or "get coin". But the user has been using "go south" to move between rooms. Wait, the problem says to only output the action, like "go north". So maybe the correct command here is "take coin" or "pick up coin". But I need to check the possible commands in the game. The user is in the Sauna, and the coin is on the floor. The game's description says "There is a coin on the floor." So the action should be to take the coin. But the user's previous actions were movement commands. However, the task says to recover the coin from the floor of the sauna. So the next step is to pick up the coin. Therefore, the correct command is "take coin" or "get coin". But I need to make sure that's the correct command in this context. Since the user is in the Sauna, and the coin is there, the next action should be to take it. So the answer is "take coin".
