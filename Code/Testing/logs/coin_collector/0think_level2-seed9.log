It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is how to play! Your first objective is to head south. With that accomplished, pick up the coin from the floor of the bedchamber. And once you"ve done that, you win!

-= Basement =-
You are in a basement. It seems to be pretty normal here. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.



You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

AGENT -------------------------------------------------

-= Bedchamber =-
A crooked placard tells you that you are now in the bedchamber.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north.

There is a coin on the floor.
