It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! First thing I need you to do is to go to the north. And then, go to the east. After that, go north. And then, venture west. And then, take a trip north. If you can manage that, make an effort to head east. Then, make an attempt to venture east. Then, venture south. With that accomplished, take a trip south. Next, travel east. If you can finish that, recover the frisbee from the floor of the closet. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Salon =-
You arrive in a salon. A standard one.

Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a portmanteau. A closed dresser, which looks typical, is right there by you. You can make out a desk. The desk appears to be empty. Hm. Oh well

There is an open hatch leading north. There is an open passageway leading south.

-= Cubicle =-
You've entered a cubicle. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."



There is an open hatch leading south. There is an unblocked exit to the east. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north.

There is a passkey on the floor.

-= Kitchen =-
This is going to sound unbelievable, but you've just entered a kitchen.

You make out a locked big freezer.

There is an unblocked exit to the east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

-= Dish-Pit =-
You arrive in a dish-pit. An usual kind of place. You begin looking for stuff.

You can see an opened refrigerator right there by you. The refrigerator is empty, what a horrible day! You can see a locked case in the room. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a bowl. However, the bowl, like an empty bowl, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You can see a shelf. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

There is an unblocked exit to the east. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in TextWorld according to the given instructions. They started by going north from the salon, then north again to the cubicle, then north to the kitchen, and back south to the dish-pit. Now they're back in the dish-pit, and the next step in their plan is to go west. But looking at the current room description, the exits mentioned are east and south. Wait, the user's previous action was going south from the kitchen to the dish-pit. Now, in the dish-pit, the exits are east and south. But the user's next step in the original instructions was to venture west. Hmm, maybe there's a mistake here. Let me check the room descriptions again.

In the dish-pit, the description says there's an unblocked exit to the east and a south exit. But the user's plan was to go west after being in the dish-pit. However, the current room doesn't mention a west exit. Maybe the user needs to look for other exits or perhaps there's a hidden path. Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to take a different route. Wait, the original instructions said after going north from the dish-pit, then venture west. But in the current room (dish-pit), the exits are east and south. So maybe the user needs to go east first, then find a way west from there. Alternatively, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the room layout.

Wait, the user's previous steps were: salon -> cubicle -> kitchen -> dish-pit (south from kitchen). Now, in the dish-pit, the exits are east and south. The user's next step in the plan was to go west. But since there's no west exit here, maybe they need to go east first. Let me check the original plan again. The user's plan was: go north, east, north, west, north, east, east, south, south, east, then find the frisbee in the closet. So after the dish-pit, the next steps would be to go east, then maybe north again, then west, etc. But in the current room (dish-pit), the user is at the dish-pit, and the exits are east and south. So the next step should be to go east. Then, from the east exit, maybe they can proceed further. The user's next action should be to go east. But the user's plan was to go west from the dish-pit. However, since there's no west exit here, maybe the user needs to go east first. Therefore, the correct next action is to go east.
