SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game called TextWorld, and they've been following a specific set of instructions to reach the goal. The goal mentioned earlier was to pick up the American latchkey, use it to unlock the American gate, and then proceed through the cubicle to the east, eventually getting the keycard from the workshop.

So far, the user has navigated through several rooms: the cubicle, bedchamber, spare room, lounge, shower, and studio. In the studio, they picked up the American latchkey. Now they're back in the cubicle, which is the starting point again. The current room has a closed American gate leading east, and exits to the north and west.

The next step according to the initial instructions was to unlock the American gate with the American latchkey. The user has the latchkey, so they need to try unlocking the gate. The gate is closed, so the action would be to use the latchkey on it. Once unlocked, they can go east through the gate. After that, they should proceed east to the workshop to pick up the keycard.

But wait, the user is currently in the cubicle. The gate is east, so they need to attempt to unlock it. The correct action here is to use the latchkey on the gate. The game might require the exact command "unlock American gate with American latchkey" or something similar. However, in the previous steps, the user was told to "unlock the American gate with the American latchkey" and then make the gate ajar. So the next step is to try unlocking it.

After unlocking, the gate would be open, allowing them to go east. Then they can proceed to the workshop, pick up the keycard, and complete the game. So the immediate next action is to unlock the gate with the latchkey they have.
