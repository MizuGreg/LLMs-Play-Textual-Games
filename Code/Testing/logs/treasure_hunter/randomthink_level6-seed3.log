Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First, it would be fantastic if you could venture west. If you can get through with that, travel west. With that accomplished, pick-up the broom from the floor of the basement. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Kitchenette =-
You've entered a kitchenette. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.



There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

>                                                                                                                                -= Kitchenette =-0/1

-= Bedroom =-
You are in a bedroom. A typical kind of place.



There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Basement =-
You arrive in a basement. A normal one.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a broom and a fly larva on the floor.


>                                                                                                                                -= Basement =-0/3
SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me figure out what to do next. The user is in the basement, and there's a broom on the floor. The goal is to pick up the broom and then win. The previous steps were going west from the kitchenette, then west again into the bedroom, and then west again to the basement. Now, in the basement, the directions mentioned are east and south. The user needs to get the broom, so maybe the broom is in the basement. The prompt says there's a broom and a fly larva on the floor. So the next step is to pick up the broom. But how? The commands available are probably 'take broom' or something similar. Wait, but the user has to move to the correct location first. Wait, the user is already in the basement. The basement has the broom. So the next action should be to take the broom. But the user's previous actions were moving west, so maybe the correct command here is 'take broom'. But the user has to check if that's allowed. The game's environment might require using 'take' or 'get' commands. Since the user is in the basement, and the broom is there, the next action is to pick it up. So the answer should be 'take broom'.
