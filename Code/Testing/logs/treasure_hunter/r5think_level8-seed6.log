Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, try to travel east. Then, travel east. With that over with, venture north. Then, pick up the cucumber from the floor of the lounge. Got that? Good!

-= Basement =-
You've come into a typical room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be typical. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the basement. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing a text adventure game. Their task was to first travel east twice, then north, and pick up the cucumber in the lounge. So far, they've been moving between the basement and sauna. Let me track their steps.

Starting in the basement, they went east to the sauna. Then they went west back to the basement. Then east again to the sauna. Now, the sauna's description mentions exits to east, north, and west. The user is in the sauna again, and the next step should be to go north as per the original task. But wait, the user's previous actions were going east and west repeatedly. Maybe they're getting confused between the rooms.

The original plan was: go east, go east again, then north. But after two easts, they should be in the sauna, then go north. However, the user's current position is in the sauna (after going east again). So the next step should be to go north from the sauna. But the user's last action was going east again, leading back to the sauna. So the next command should be 'go north' to proceed towards the lounge where the cucumber is. But the user's previous actions were oscillating between basement and sauna. Maybe they need to go north from the sauna. Let me check the sauna's description again. The sauna has an exit to the north which is unblocked. So going north from the sauna would take them to the next room, possibly the lounge. Then they can pick up the cucumber. So the correct next action is 'go north'.
</think>go north

-= Cookhouse =-
You find yourself in a cookhouse. An ordinary kind of place.



There is an unguarded exit to the east. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

There is a butterfly on the floor.

You can't go that way.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in TextWorld. Their goal is to pick up the cucumber from the lounge and put it in a place. So far, they've moved between the basement, sauna, and cookhouse. 

In the cookhouse, they tried to go north again but couldn't. The current room is the cookhouse, and there's a butterfly on the floor. The exits are east and south. The user needs to figure out the right path to reach the lounge where the cucumber is.

Since they can't go north from the cookhouse, maybe they should check other directions. The exit to the east is unguarded, so going east might be an option. Alternatively, going south could lead them back to a previous room. But the original task was to go east twice, then north. Maybe they need to go east again from the cookhouse. Let me check the previous steps.

Wait, the user's initial instructions were: travel east, then east again, then north. But after moving east twice, they ended up in the sauna, then went west back to basement, then east again. Now they're in the cookhouse. Maybe the path isn't straightforward. The user might need to explore the cookhouse's exits. Since they can't go north, perhaps going east from here would lead them to another room. Alternatively, going south might take them back to the basement. But the goal is to reach the lounge. Maybe the cookhouse is part of the path. The user needs to find the correct sequence of moves to get to the lounge where the cucumber is. The next step should be to go east from the cookhouse since that's an available exit. Let's try that.

-= Lounge =-
You are in an ordinary kind of place. That is to say, you're in a lounge.



There is an unblocked exit to the south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

There is a cucumber on the floor.
