Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! First of all, go to the north. With that done, make an attempt to take a trip east. With that done, pick up the latchkey from the pan. That's it!

-= Bathroom =-
You find yourself in a bathroom. A standard kind of place.

Were you looking for a board? Because look over there, it's a board. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is an open gateway leading north. There is an open gate leading south.

-= Cubicle =-
I am sorry to announce that you are now in the cubicle.

You see a coffer. You make out an opened trunk. The trunk is empty! What a waste of a day!

There is an open gateway leading south. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east.

-= Cookhouse =-
Wow! You're in a cookhouse. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You make out a pan. The pan is ordinary. On the pan you see a latchkey. You scan the room, seeing a bowl. However, the bowl, like an empty bowl, has nothing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the bowl.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

<think>
Okay, let me figure out what to do next. The user is in the Cookhouse, and they need to pick up the latchkey from the pan. The previous steps were going north to the Cubicle and then east to the Cookhouse. Now, in the Cookhouse, they see a pan with a latchkey on it. The goal was to pick up the latchkey.

So the next logical step is to take the latchkey from the pan. The user hasn't done that yet. The prompt says "pick up the latchkey from the pan." So the command should be "take latchkey from pan" or something similar. But in the game's context, maybe it's "take latchkey" or "pick up latchkey". The exact phrasing might matter. Let me check the previous commands. The user was told to "pick up the latchkey from the pan." So the correct command would be "take latchkey from pan" or "pick up latchkey from pan". But in TextWorld, sometimes the command is just "take latchkey" if it's on a nearby object. However, since the pan is mentioned, maybe specifying the pan is necessary. Let me see the current description again: "On the pan you see a latchkey." So the correct action is to take the latchkey from the pan. Therefore, the next command should be "take latchkey from pan".
