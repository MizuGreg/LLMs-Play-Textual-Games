Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, you could, like, head north. And then, make an attempt to take a trip east. And then, try to travel south. Once you accomplish that, make an attempt to venture east. And then, recover the latchkey from the floor of the spare room. Got that? Good!

-= Bar =-
You've entered a bar.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.
