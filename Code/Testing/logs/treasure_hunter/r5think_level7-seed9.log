Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First, it would be fantastic if you could make an effort to head east. With that done, make an attempt to go to the east. After that, go to the north. And then, retrieve the teapot from the floor of the canteen. That's it!

-= Bedchamber =-
You find yourself in a bedchamber. A standard kind of place.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Basement =-
You arrive in a basement. An ordinary kind of place.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

-= Spare Room =-
You've entered a spare room. The room is well lit.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game where they have to navigate through different rooms and retrieve a teapot. The current setup is that they've been moving between the bedchamber, basement, spare room, and back to the basement. The goal is to get the teapot from the canteen floor.

First, I need to track the user's progress. They started by going east from the bedchamber, then south to the spare room, then north back to the basement. Now they're back in the basement again. The next step would be to check if they're getting closer to the canteen. But the current rooms mentioned are basement, spare room, etc. The canteen hasn't been mentioned yet. 

Wait, the original instruction was to go east, then east again, then north, then retrieve the teapot from the canteen's floor. But the user's path so far has them moving between basement and spare room. Maybe the canteen is a different room. The user might need to find the canteen room, which could be accessible from the basement. 

In the basement, there's an exit to the east, south, and west. The user is currently in the basement again. The previous steps suggest that the user might be looping between rooms. The next logical step would be to check the exits again. Since the user is in the basement, maybe going west is the way to go, as there's an unguarded exit there. But the user's last action was going north, which brought them back to the basement. 

Alternatively, maybe the canteen is in the spare room. But the spare room's description doesn't mention a teapot. The user needs to find the canteen's floor. Perhaps the canteen is in the basement. But the basement's description doesn't mention a canteen. 

Wait, the original instruction said to retrieve the teapot from the floor of the canteen. So the user needs to find the canteen room. The current path hasn't reached that yet. The user is in the basement, so maybe they need to go east to the next room, which might be the canteen. But the basement's exit to the east is mentioned as unblocked. So the next step would be to go east from the basement. 

But the user's last action was going north, which brought them back to the basement. The next step should be to check the exits again. The user might need to go east from the basement to reach the canteen. Alternatively, maybe the canteen is in the spare room. But the spare room's description doesn't mention it. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go west from the basement. The basement has an unguarded exit to the west. So going west might lead to another room. But the user hasn't tried that yet. 

The user's current position is in the basement. The possible exits are east, south, and west. The user has already tried going south (to the spare room) and then north back to the basement. The next step might be to go west from the basement. Let's check the previous steps. The user was in the basement, then went south to the spare room, then north back to the basement. Now, the user is back in the basement. The next action should be to go west, as that's an unguarded exit. 

But the user's last message says they are in the basement again, and the options are east, south, west. The user's next move should be to go west to check if that leads to the canteen. Alternatively, maybe the canteen is east. But the user hasn't checked that yet. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go east from the basement. Let's think. The original goal was to go east, then east again, then north, then retrieve the teapot. But the user's path has them going east, south, north, back to basement. Maybe they need to go east again from the basement. 

But the user's current position is the basement. The exit to the east is unblocked. So the next step would be to go east. However, the user's previous steps have them moving between rooms, so maybe the correct path is to go east from the basement to reach the canteen. 

Alternatively, maybe the canteen is in the spare room. But the spare room's description doesn't mention it. The user needs to find the canteen's floor. 

Given the current state, the next logical step is to go east from the basement. So the answer should be "go east".

-= Sauna =-
You've just walked into a sauna. Let's see what's in here.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.



>                                                                                                                                -= Sauna =-0/5

-= Canteen =-
You've entered a canteen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.



You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.
