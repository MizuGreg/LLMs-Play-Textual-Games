It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, you could, like, travel west. And then, lift the latchkey from the floor of the workshop. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Spare Room =-
You find yourself in a spare room. An usual kind of place. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.



There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

-= Workshop =-
You've just sauntered into a workshop.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the north.

There is a gummy bear and a latchkey on the floor.

That's not a verb I recognise.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game where they need to navigate and complete certain tasks. The goal mentioned is to lift the latchkey from the workshop floor and then win. 

Looking at the previous interactions, the user first went west from the Spare Room into the Workshop. Then, they tried to "lift the latchkey," but the system responded that it's not a recognized verb. The user tried again, and the same error occurred. Now, the user is asking if they're making the right actions and if they're close to the goal.

First, I need to check the game's possible commands. In text adventures, common verbs are 'go', 'take', 'use', 'open', 'close', 'look', etc. The user tried 'lift', which might not be the correct verb here. Maybe the correct action is 'take' or 'pick up' the latchkey. Since the game's response says 'lift' isn't a verb, the user should use the correct command.

The user is in the Workshop, which has a gummy bear and a latchkey on the floor. The goal is to lift the latchkey. Since 'lift' isn't working, perhaps the correct command is 'take latchkey' or 'pick up latchkey'. The game might expect 'take' instead of 'lift'. 

The user's next action should be to take the latchkey. After that, they might need to exit through the north exit or another path. But according to the initial instructions, once the latchkey is lifted, they win. So the key is to correctly use the verb for taking the item.

Therefore, the correct next command is 'take latchkey' or similar. The user needs to use the right verb. Since the system rejected 'lift', the user should try 'take' instead.
