Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First off, move east. Then, go south. And then, make an attempt to go west. Then, attempt to venture west. And then, go west. Then, make an effort to travel south. Then, pick up the spork from the floor of the cookery. And once you've done that, you win!

Well, here we are in the cookhouse.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

There is an open gate leading south. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game and has been following a set of instructions to move in certain directions. The goal is to pick up the spork in the cookery and then win. So far, they've moved east, north, south, west, and then west again, ending up in the Playroom.

Now, the current location is the Playroom. The clues here mention an open gate south, exits east, north, and west. The user's next step should be to continue moving towards the cookery area. Since the original path required moving west from the cookhouse, and they're now in the Playroom, maybe the next step is to go south through the open gate. But wait, the user's goal is to get to the cookery to pick up the spork. The cookhouse was the starting point, and the cookery might be a different area. However, the user has already been in the cookhouse and closet, kitchenette, etc. Maybe the spork is in the cookery, which could be a room connected to the Playroom. 

Looking at the directions in the Playroom: there's an open gate south, so maybe that leads to the cookery. Alternatively, the user might need to go west from the Playroom since the previous directions mentioned west as unblocked. But the user's original plan was to go west multiple times. However, the current position is the Playroom, and the next step should be to check where the spork is. Since the user hasn't picked it up yet, they need to find the right path. The cookery is likely connected to the cookhouse, so maybe going south from the Playroom through the open gate would lead to the cookery. Alternatively, maybe the spork is in the kitchenette or closet. But the user hasn't checked those areas yet. 

Wait, the user's instructions said to move east, then south, then west, then west again, then south, then pick up the spork. So after moving west to the Playroom, the next step would be to go south through the open gate to reach the cookery. That makes sense because the cookery is part of the cookhouse area. So the next action should be to go south.

-= Cubicle =-
You are in a cubicle. A normal kind of place.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they need to follow a series of directions to reach the goal. The original instructions were to move east, then south, then west, then west again, then south, pick up the spork, and win.

So far, the user has gone through several rooms: Cookhouse, Closet, Kitchenette, back to Closet, Cookhouse, Playroom, Cubicle, Workshop, back to Cubicle, Basement, Office, Bedroom, and now Canteen. The current room is the Canteen, where there's a locked case and an open hatch west, unblocked exit east, and suggestion to go north.

The user's next action should be to go north, as per the提示 in the Canteen description. But I need to check if that's the correct path towards the spork. The goal is to pick up the spork from the cookery, which was mentioned in the initial instructions. The user has been moving through different rooms, but maybe the spork is in the Cookhouse or Closet. However, in the current Canteen, the next step is to go north. Let me make sure that's the right direction. The Canteen's description says to try going north. So the next command should be "go north".

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out what's going on here. The user is in a text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and eventually pick up a spork to win. The current room is the Cubicle, and the user has been moving around various locations like the Cookhouse, Closet, Kitchenette, Playroom, Workshop, etc.

Looking at the history, the user has been following a path that involves moving east, north, south, west, and back again. The goal is to pick up the spork from the cookery. The last few moves have the user oscillating between the Workshop and Cubicle. 

In the Cubicle, the description mentions a coffer and a desk. The user might need to interact with these objects. The original goal was to pick up the spork from the cookery, which is in the Cookhouse. However, the user has been moving away from the Cookhouse, entering the Closet, Kitchenette, Playroom, Workshop, and now the Cubicle again.

Wait, the initial instruction said to move east, then south, then west, then west again, then south, pick up the spork. But the user might have gotten lost in the maze of rooms. The key is to find the spork. The Cookhouse was the starting point, and the spork is in the cookery. But the user might have moved away from there.

Looking at the current room, the Cubicle, there's a coffer. Maybe the spork is in the coffer? Or perhaps the user needs to go back to the Cookhouse. The user needs to find the spork, which is in the cookery. The Cookhouse has an exit to the east, north, south, and west. The user might need to go back to the Cookhouse and check the cookery area.

But in the current room, the user is in the Cubicle. The exits are north, west, and east. The user has been going back and forth between Workshop and Cubicle. Maybe the spork is in the Cubicle's coffer. The user should check the coffer. But the game might require interacting with objects, not just moving. However, the user's previous actions were just moving, not interacting. The original goal was to pick up the spork, so maybe the spork is in the cookery area of the Cookhouse.

Wait, the initial instruction said to "pick up the spork from the floor of the cookery." So the spork is in the cookery area of the Cookhouse. The user needs to go back to the Cookhouse and pick it up. But the user has been moving away from the Cookhouse. The last move was to the Cubicle, so the user needs to go back to the Cookhouse.

Looking at the current room (Cubicle), the exits are north to Workshop, west to portal, and east to unguarded exit. The user should go east to the Workshop, then find a way back to the Cookhouse. Alternatively, go west through the portal. But the user needs to get back to the Cookhouse to pick up the spork.

Alternatively, maybe the spork is in the Cubicle's coffer. The user needs to check the coffer. But the game might require the user to open it. However, the user's previous actions were just moving, not interacting. The user might need to open the coffer to find the spork. But the game might not have that step yet.

Alternatively, the user might have missed the spork in an earlier room. The initial movement was to go east, then south, then west, then west again, then south. The user might have passed the spork in the Cookhouse. But the user is now in the Cubicle, so they need to find the path back to the Cookhouse.

The user's next action should be to go back to the Cookhouse. From the Cubicle, the unguarded exit is east to the Workshop. Then, from the Workshop, go north or south to get back to the Cookhouse. Alternatively, go west through the portal. But the user needs to find the path back.

Alternatively, the user might need to go west from the Cubicle through the portal. The portal leads west, so that's a possible path. Then, from the portal, maybe to the Playroom, then back to the Cookhouse.

But the user's goal is to pick up the spork in the Cookhouse's cookery. So the user needs to get back to the Cookhouse. The current room is Cubicle, so the user should go east to the Workshop, then find a way back.

But the user has been moving in a loop between Workshop and Cubicle. Maybe the user needs to go west from the Cubicle through the portal. Let's check the description again. In the Cubicle, there's an open portal leading west. So the user can go west through the portal. Then, from there, maybe to the Playroom, then to the Kitchenette, then to the Closet, then back to the Cookhouse.

Alternatively, from the Cubicle, go east to the Workshop, then north to the Workshop's north exit, which is unguarded. Then, from there, maybe back to the Cookhouse.

But the user needs to get back to the Cookhouse. The user's next action should be to go west through the portal in the Cubicle. That would be the correct move to get back towards the Cookhouse.

You're now in the study.

You make out a closed toolbox in the corner. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a locker. You see a mantle. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's an armchair. The armchair is normal. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open portal leading east. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.
