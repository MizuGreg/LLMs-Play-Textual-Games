Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First off, venture south. After that, try to go west. That done, lift the gummy bear from the floor of the chamber. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Study =-
Well I'll be, you are in a place we're calling a study. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a display.

There is an unguarded exit to the north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

go south

-= Cookhouse =-
Guess what, you are in the place we're calling the cookhouse.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

go west

-= Chamber =-
You've entered a chamber.

You make out a locker!

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

There is a gummy bear on the floor.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me figure out what to do next. The user is in the Chamber, and there's a gummy bear on the floor. The goal was to lift the gummy bear from the floor of the chamber. So the next step should be to pick up the gummy bear.

But wait, the previous actions were going south, then west. The current room is the Chamber. The description mentions a locker and exits in all directions except maybe east? Wait, the user is told that there's an unblocked exit to the north, east, and west. But the goal is to lift the gummy bear here. So the correct action is to take the gummy bear. The game's goal is to pick it up, so that's the next command.
</think>take gummy bear
