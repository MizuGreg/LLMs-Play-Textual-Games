Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First, it would be fantastic if you could make an attempt to go to the east. And then, try to head north. With that over with, retrieve the teapot from the floor of the canteen. That's it!

-= Basement =-
You arrive in a basement. An ordinary kind of place.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the west.
