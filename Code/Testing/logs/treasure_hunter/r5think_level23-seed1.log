SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game and has been moving through different rooms. The original goal was to head north, then east, then south, then east again, pick up the keycard from the workshop, and then head east. So far, the user has gone from the Spare Room to the Lounge, then East to the Shower, South to the Studio, South again to the Cubicle, and then East to the Laundromat.

Now, the current room is the Laundromat. The description mentions there's an open wooden gateway leading east and west. The user's next move would be to check if there's a path towards the workshop where the keycard is. Since the original plan was to go east again after the Cubicle, maybe the Laundromat is part of that path. But the user needs to find the workshop. Alternatively, maybe the keycard is in a room that's accessible from here. The user should check the possible exits. The Laundromat has east and west exits. The user was previously coming from the Cubicle (west) into the Laundromat. So maybe the workshop is east? But the user needs to follow the original steps: after going east from the Cubicle (which was the Laundromat), the next step was to pick up the keycard from the workshop. So perhaps the workshop is east of the Laundromat. But the user hasn't found it yet. The next action would be to go east again to check. Alternatively, maybe the workshop is west, but the user came from the west. Hmm. The user's next move should be to go east to continue towards the workshop. So the next command would be "go east".
</think>go east

-= Workshop =-

There is a keycard on the floor.
