Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First stop, make an attempt to go to the west. And then, make an attempt to venture north. After that, make an effort to venture west. Once you succeed at that, head south. And then, pick-up the chocolate bar from the floor of the chamber. Alright, thanks!

-= Bedroom =-
You arrive in a bedroom. An usual one.

You can see an opened box here. The box is empty! What a waste of a day! You see a coffer!

You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Cookhouse =-
Ah, the cookhouse. This is some kind of cookhouse, really great normal vibes in this place, a wonderful normal atmosphere. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.



There is an unguarded exit to the east. There is an unblocked exit to the north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

I just think it's great that you've just entered a kitchenette.

You can see a freezer.

There is an open hatch leading north. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Chamber =-
You make another one of your grand eccentric entrances into a chamber.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the north.

There is a chocolate bar on the floor.


>                                                                                                                                -= Chamber =-0/5
SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user has been moving through different rooms in the text-based game. The goal was to pick up the chocolate bar from the chamber. So far, they've gone west from the bedroom, then north to the cookhouse, west to the study, south to the kitchenette, and then west again to the chamber. Wait, no, the last move was go south from the kitchenette to the chamber. Now they're in the chamber, which has the chocolate bar on the floor.

The next step would be to pick up the chocolate bar. But the user's last action was moving south to the chamber. The current room is the chamber, and the chocolate is there. So the correct action now is to pick up the chocolate bar. However, in many text adventures, you can't pick up items unless you're interacting with them. The prompt says to pick-up the chocolate bar from the floor. So the next command should be "take chocolate bar" or "get chocolate bar". But the user's previous commands were all "go directions", so maybe the correct command here is "take chocolate bar". But I need to check the game's rules. Since the user is in the chamber and the chocolate is on the floor, the correct action is to pick it up. So the answer should be "take chocolate bar".
</think>take chocolate bar
