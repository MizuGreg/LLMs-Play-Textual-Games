You are now playing a profound game of TextWorld! First stop, attempt to take a trip east. After that, pick-up the fondue from the floor of the cookhouse. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Chamber =-
You're now in the chamber. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.
