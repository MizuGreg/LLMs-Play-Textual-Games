I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, make an attempt to go to the north. And then, make an attempt to travel east. If you can get through with that, travel south. After that, go to the east. Next, travel east. After that, make an effort to go to the east. And then, recover the candy bar from the floor of the laundry place. Alright, thanks!

-= Recreation Zone =-
You're now in the recreation zone.

You see a box.

There is an unguarded exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Bedchamber =-
You find yourself in a bedchamber. A typical one.

You can see a bed. The bed is usual. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. This always happens, here in TextWorld!

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Spare Room =-
Ah, the spare room. This is some kind of spare room, really great ordinary vibes in this place, a wonderful ordinary atmosphere. And now, well, you're in it. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You make out an opened crate nearby. The crate is empty! What a waste of a day! An open chest, which looks normal, is here. What a letdown! The chest is empty! You make out a shelf! The shelf is usual. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is an unblocked exit to the east. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

-= Canteen =-
I just think it's great that you've just entered a canteen.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Cookery =-
You arrive in a cookery. An usual kind of place.

Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a freezer. Now why would someone leave that there? You can make out a fridge. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a platter. The platter is standard. The platter appears to be empty.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game called TextWorld. Their task is to navigate through different rooms and eventually recover a candy bar from the laundry place. So far, they've moved from the Recreation Zone to the Bedchamber, then to the Spare Room, Canteen, and now the Cookery. The current room is the Cookery, which has a freezer, a fridge, and a platter. The user is asked if they think they're on the right track and if they're close to the goal.

First, I need to figure out the next logical step. The user's previous actions were going north, east, south, east. Now in the Cookery, the possible exits are east (unguarded) and west (unguarded). The goal is to get to the laundry place and retrieve the candy bar. The user hasn't mentioned the laundry place yet, so maybe they need to continue exploring.

Looking at the current room description, there's a fridge and a platter. The user might need to check if there's any item here, but the platter is empty. The fridge might have something, but the description doesn't mention it. However, the main goal is to get to the laundry place. So the next step would be to check the exits. The user was told to go east again, but the Cookery's east exit is unguarded. Alternatively, the west exit is unguarded. But the user's previous steps were moving east, so maybe continuing east is the way to go. However, the user is at the Cookery, and the next possible exits are east and west. The laundry place might be in a different direction. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west back to the Canteen or Spare Room, but that might not be the right path.

Wait, the original task was to go north, then east, then south, then east, then east again, and then recover the candy bar from the laundry place. So after the Cookery, the next step would be to go east again, as per the original plan. But the Cookery's east exit is unguarded. So the user should go east again. However, the user is in the Cookery, and the next room might be another area. Alternatively, maybe the laundry place is in a different direction. But according to the initial instructions, after going east from the Canteen, they arrived at the Cookery. Then the next step was to go east again, but the Cookery's east exit is unguarded. So the user should go east again. However, the user is now in the Cookery, and the next action would be to go east. But the user is being asked if they think they're close to the goal. The user hasn't found the candy bar yet, so maybe they need to continue moving towards the laundry place. The laundry place is probably in a different room. So the next step would be to go east again from the Cookery. Alternatively, maybe the laundry place is in the west direction, but that's not clear. The user needs to follow the original plan: after Cookery, go east again. So the next action should be go east.

-= Dish-Pit =-
Of every dish-pit you could have sauntered into, you had to saunter into a normal one. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You scan the room for a cabinet, and you find a cabinet. The cabinet is empty, what a horrible day!

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

-= Laundry Place =-
You are in a laundry place. A typical kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

You can see a trunk.

You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a candy bar on the floor.


>                                                                                                                                -= Laundry Place =-0/7

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Laundry Place, and there's a candy bar on the floor. The original goal was to recover the candy bar from the floor of the laundry place. So the next step should be to pick up the candy bar.

But wait, the user has been moving around the rooms, going east, south, etc. The current room is Laundry Place, and the candy bar is here. The command should be to take the candy bar. However, in TextWorld, sometimes you need to use specific commands like 'take' or 'get'. But the user's previous actions were just 'go north', 'go east', etc. Maybe the correct command here is 'take candy bar' or 'get candy bar'. But the user's instructions said to only output the action, like "go north". So perhaps the correct command is 'take candy bar' or 'get candy bar'. But I need to check if the game expects 'take' or 'get'. Since the user hasn't used any other commands besides movement, maybe 'take' is the right verb here. So the next action should be 'take candy bar'.
