Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First, it would be fantastic if you could make an effort to head east. With that done, make an attempt to go to the east. After that, go to the north. And then, retrieve the teapot from the floor of the canteen. That's it!

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through these rooms to reach the canteen and get the teapot. So far, they've gone east from the bedchamber into the basement, then south to the spare room, and back north to the basement again. The pattern seems to be moving between the basement and spare room.

The original goal was to go east, then north, and retrieve the teapot from the canteen. But the current location is the basement. The user might be stuck in a loop between the basement and spare room. The teapot is in the canteen, which hasn't been mentioned yet. Maybe the path to the canteen is through the basement exit to the east. But the user has been going south and north between the basement and spare room. 

Wait, in the basement, there's an exit to the east. The user was told to go east first. Maybe after getting to the basement, going east would be the next step. But the user has been going south from the basement to the spare room and back. Maybe they need to go east from the basement to reach the canteen. Let me check the previous steps again.

The initial instruction was to go east, then north, then get the teapot from the canteen. But the user's path has them moving between basement and spare room. Maybe the canteen is in the east direction from the basement. So after going east from the basement, they might reach the canteen. Then they can go north from there to get the teapot. But the user hasn't tried going east yet from the basement. The last action was going south from the basement to the spare room again. So the next step should be to go east from the basement to reach the canteen, then proceed north to get the teapot. But the user is at the basement again. So the correct next action is to go east.

You can't go that way.

Okay, let's try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and retrieve a teapot from the canteen. The current situation is that they're in the Basement, and the possible exits are East, South, and West. The previous attempts have been going back and forth between the Basement and Spare Room, but they haven't found the canteen yet.

The original goal was to go east, then north, and retrieve the teapot from the canteen's floor. But the user has been moving between rooms without clearly progressing towards the canteen. The challenge is to find the right path that leads to the canteen where the teapot is located.

Looking at the room descriptions, the Basement has an exit to the east, south, and west. The Spare Room has a north exit. The user tried going east from the Spare Room, but that was blocked. Then they went north again, which brought them back to the Basement. Now, they need to find a way to get to the canteen. 

Since the canteen is mentioned as a place where the teapot is on the floor, maybe the canteen is a different room. The user needs to find the correct path that leads to the canteen. Perhaps the canteen is accessible from the Basement via the east exit? Or maybe through the west exit? The user has been trying to go south from the Basement, which leads back to the Spare Room, but that doesn't seem to be helping.

Alternatively, maybe the canteen is in a room that's connected via the east exit from the Basement. The user should try going east from the Basement to see if that leads to the canteen. But earlier, when they tried going east from the Spare Room, it was blocked. However, from the Basement, the east exit is unblocked. So perhaps the canteen is east of the Basement. Let me check the previous steps again.

The user started in the Bedchamber, went east to the Basement, then south to the Spare Room, then north back to the Basement. Now, they need to try going east from the Basement to see if that leads to the canteen. If that's blocked, maybe the west exit is the way, but the west exit is unguarded. Alternatively, maybe the canteen is in the Spare Room? But the Spare Room is well lit, and the canteen is a different place. 

Wait, the original instruction was to go east, then north, then retrieve the teapot from the canteen. So maybe after going east and north, the user should be in the canteen. But the current position is the Basement. So perhaps the correct path is to go east from the Basement, then proceed further. Let me try that. The next action should be to go east from the Basement.

-= Sauna =-
You've just walked into a sauna. Let's see what's in here.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.



>                                                                                                                                -= Sauna =-0/8

-= Canteen =-
You've entered a canteen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.



You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a keycard and a teapot on the floor.

Okay, let's see. The user's goal is to retrieve the teapot from the floor of the canteen. So far, they've navigated through the bedchamber, basement, spare room, and sauna to get to the canteen. In the canteen, they noticed a keycard and a teapot on the floor. The next logical step would be to pick up the teapot. Since the teapot is on the floor, the command should be "take teapot" or something similar. The environment mentions the teapot is on the floor, so taking it would fulfill the goal. Let me check the previous commands to ensure consistency. The user has been moving around, so the correct action here is to take the teapot.
