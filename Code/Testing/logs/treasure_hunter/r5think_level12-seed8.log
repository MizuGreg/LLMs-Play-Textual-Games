Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an exciting round of TextWorld? You do! First, it would be fantastic if you could ensure that the passageway is open. Then, travel east. After that, recover the nest of earwigs from the floor of the attic. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Cubicle =-
You are in a cubicle. A standard one. The room is well lit.

You can see a safe. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You can make out a table. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is a closed passageway leading east. There is an open portal leading north. There is an open hatch leading west. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this TextWorld game. The current scenario is in a cubicle with a closed passageway east, an open portal north, open hatch west, and exit south. The previous actions were "go east" which wasn't possible because the passageway was closed. Then they tried "open passageway", which worked.

Now, the user is asking if they're making the right actions and if they're close to the goal. The original goal was to ensure the passageway is open, travel east, recover the earwigs from the attic, then stop. So far, they've opened the passageway, so the next step is to go east. But the user is asking if they're on the right track. Since they've opened the passageway, the next logical step is to go east. Then, after that, they need to find the attic and get the earwigs. But maybe there's a trick here. Wait, the initial instruction said to first ensure the passageway is open, then travel east, then recover the earwigs. So after opening the passageway, going east is next. So the next action should be "go east". The user's current location is the cubicle, and after opening the passageway, they can go east. Then, perhaps the next room is the attic? Or maybe another area. But the user hasn't reached the attic yet. So the next step is definitely go east. The user is on the right track. So the answer is "go east".

-= Attic =-
You've stumbled into an usual room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be usual. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the attic.

You make out a workbench. The workbench is typical. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is an open passageway leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

There is a nest of earwigs on the floor.

Okay, let me think through this. The user is playing a text adventure game called TextWorld. The goal is to open the passageway, go east, recover the earwigs' nest from the attic, and then stop.

So far, the player started in the cubicle, opened the passageway, went east to the attic. Now, in the attic, there's a nest of earwigs on the floor. The next step should be to recover that nest. But how? The user needs to pick it up or maybe just collect it. The available commands here are moving directions, but since the nest is on the floor, maybe the player needs to take it. However, in text adventures, sometimes you just pick up items by using a command like 'take' or 'pick up'. But the user's previous actions were 'go east' and 'open passageway', which are movement commands. The current room is the attic, and the nest is there. So the next logical step is to take the nest. But the user's last action was 'go east', which led them to the attic. Now, they need to interact with the nest. The instruction says to recover the nest from the floor of the attic. So the correct command here would be to take the nest. But the user's previous commands were movement commands. However, in TextWorld, you might need to use 'take' or 'get' to pick up items. But the user's previous actions didn't include any such command. Wait, the initial instructions said to "recover the nest of earwigs from the floor of the attic." So maybe the player needs to pick it up. But the user's last action was 'go east', which led them to the attic. Now, they need to take the nest. So the next command should be 'take nest of earwigs' or something similar. However, in TextWorld, the exact phrasing might matter. Let me check the current room description again. The attic has a nest of earwigs on the floor. So the correct command is to take the nest. But the user's previous actions were movement. The user is supposed to say the next action. The user's last action was 'go east', which brought them to the attic. Now, the next step is to take the nest. So the answer should be 'take nest of earwigs' or 'take earwigs' or similar. But the exact command depends on the game's verbs. Since the user is in the attic and the nest is there, the correct action is to take it. So the next command is 'take nest of earwigs'.
