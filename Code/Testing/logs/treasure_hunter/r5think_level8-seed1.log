Welcome to TextWorld! Here is how to play! Your first objective is to venture east. And then, go north. And then, travel north. With that over with, pick up the passkey from the floor of the cookery. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Dish-Pit =-
Well, here we are in the dish-pit. You start to take note of what's in the room.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Okay, let me think through this. The user is in a text-based game where they need to follow specific directions to reach the passkey in the cookery. So far, they've gone east from the dish-pit, then north into the cookhouse, and then north again into the studio. The current room is the studio, and the next step according to the original instructions was to travel north again. But looking at the studio's description, the exits are north, south, and west. The user's previous action was going north from the cookhouse to the studio. Now, the next step in the original plan was to go north again from the studio. However, the user is being asked if they think they're making the right moves and if they're close to the goal.

Wait, the original goal was to go east, then north, then north again, then pick up the passkey from the cookery. But the user is now in the studio. The cookery is probably a different room. Let me check the previous steps again. The first objective was to venture east (from the dish-pit), then go north (to cookhouse), then travel north again (to studio). Then, pick up the passkey from the floor of the cookery. Wait, the cookery might be a different room. Maybe the cookhouse is part of the cookery? Or maybe the passkey is in the cookhouse. But the user is now in the studio. So perhaps the next step is to go south from the studio back to the cookhouse, then collect the passkey. But the original plan said to go north again from the studio. However, the user is being asked if they're on the right track. The user might have made a mistake in the direction. Let me check the directions again.

In the studio, the exits are north (unblocked), south (unguarded), and west (unblocked). The original plan said after the studio, pick up the passkey from the cookery. But the user is in the studio. Maybe the cookery is the cookhouse. So perhaps the user needs to go south from the studio back to the cookhouse, then collect the passkey. But the original instructions said to go north again from the studio. Wait, maybe the user is supposed to go north from the studio to reach the cookery. But the cookery might be a different room. Alternatively, maybe the passkey is in the cookhouse, which is where the user came from. But the user is in the studio now. So perhaps the correct path is to go south from the studio back to the cookhouse, then check the floor for the passkey. However, the original plan said to go north again from the studio. But the user is being asked if they are close. The user might have taken the wrong turn. Alternatively, maybe the cookery is the studio. But the original goal was to pick up the passkey from the floor of the cookery. So if the user is in the studio, maybe that's the cookery. But the original plan said to go east, then north, then north again. So the user is now in the studio, which is the third step. Then the next step is to pick up the passkey. But the user hasn't done that yet. So perhaps the user needs to check the floor of the studio for the passkey. But the original instructions said the passkey is in the cookery. So maybe the cookery is the cookhouse. Therefore, the user needs to go back to the cookhouse (south from studio) and pick up the passkey. But the user is being asked if they are making the right moves. The user's previous action was going north from the cookhouse to the studio. So the next step should be to go south back to the cookhouse. But the user is being asked if they think they're close. The user might have made a mistake by going north again, but the correct path is to go south. However, the original plan said to go north again. Wait, maybe the cookery is the studio. The original goal was to pick up the passkey from the cookery. So if the user is in the studio, then that's the cookery. So the next step is to pick up the passkey. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the user should check the floor of the studio. But the user's next action would be to pick it up. However, the user is being asked to say the next action. The user is in the studio, and the next step is to pick up the passkey. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the correct action is to pick up the passkey. But the user is supposed to go north again. Wait, the original instructions said: "venture east. And then, go north. And then, travel north. With that over with, pick up the passkey from the floor of the cookery." So after going north twice, the user is in the studio. Then, the next step is to pick up the passkey from the cookery. But the cookery might be the studio. So the user should check the floor here. Therefore, the next action is to pick up the passkey. But the user is in the studio, and the passkey is on the floor. So the correct action is to pick it up. However, the user is being asked to say the next action. The user is in the studio, and the next step is to pick up the passkey. Therefore, the answer is to pick it up. But the user's previous actions were going north, so maybe the next step is to go south back to the cookhouse. But the original plan says after going north twice, pick up the passkey. So the user is in the studio, which is the cookery. Therefore, the next action is to pick up the passkey. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the answer is to pick it up. However, the user is being asked to say the next action. The user is in the studio, and the passkey is on the floor. So the correct action is to pick it up. Therefore, the answer is "pick up passkey".

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game called TextWorld. The goal is to venture east, then north, then north again, pick up the passkey from the cookery, and win.

So far, the user has gone from the Dish-Pit east to the Cookhouse, then north to the Studio. Then they tried to pick up the passkey but couldn't see it. Then they went south back to the Cookhouse. Now, in the Cookhouse again, the options are north and west.

The user is asking if they're making the right moves and if they're close to the goal. Let me think about the path. The original plan was: start at Dish-Pit, go east to Cookhouse, then north to Studio, then north again. But in the Studio, they tried to pick up the passkey but couldn't. Maybe the passkey is in the Cookhouse? Or maybe they need to go west from the Cookhouse?

Wait, the initial instructions said to pick up the passkey from the floor of the cookery. So maybe the passkey is in the Cookhouse. But when the user was in the Studio, they tried to pick it up but couldn't. So perhaps they need to go back to the Cookhouse and look for it there.

In the current state, the user is in the Cookhouse again. The options are to go north (unblocked) or west (unguarded). If they go west, maybe they can find the passkey. Alternatively, maybe they need to go north again from the Cookhouse to the Studio, but that's where they were before. But the passkey is in the cookery, which is the Cookhouse. So perhaps the user needs to check the Cookhouse's floor for the passkey. But in the previous step, when they were in the Studio, they couldn't see it. So maybe they need to go back to the Cookhouse and look for it there.

So the next action should be to go west from the Cookhouse to check if the passkey is there. Alternatively, maybe the passkey is in the Cookhouse, and the user just needs to pick it up once they are in the Cookhouse. But in the first visit to the Cookhouse, they didn't pick it up. So maybe they need to go west to another area where the passkey is located.

Wait, the initial instructions said to pick up the passkey from the floor of the cookery. So the Cookhouse is the cookery. So maybe the user needs to go west from the Cookhouse to reach the area where the passkey is. But the options in the Cookhouse are north and west. So going west might lead to the passkey. So the next action should be to go west.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

If you're wondering why everything seems so standard all of a sudden, it's because you've just shown up in the spare room.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

There is a keycard on the floor.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text adventure game. Their goal is to pick up the passkey from the floor of the cookery and then reach the original goal. So far, they've moved through the Dish-Pit, Cookhouse, Studio, and now they're in the Spare Room.

In the Spare Room, there's a keycard on the floor. The original goal mentioned picking up the passkey from the cookery. Wait, but here in the Spare Room, there's a keycard. Maybe that's the passkey they need? The user hasn't picked it up yet. The prompt says to pick up the passkey from the cookery, but maybe in this room, the keycard is the passkey. The user is in the Spare Room now, so the next logical step would be to pick up the keycard here. The directions mention that there's an unguarded exit to the south, so maybe they can go back to the Cookhouse, but the key is here. So the correct action would be to pick up the keycard. But the user's previous action was going north to get here. Now, in the Spare Room, they need to pick up the keycard on the floor. The command should be "pick up keycard" or "pick up passkey". The game might refer to it as a keycard instead of passkey. Let me check the previous messages. The original goal said "pick up the passkey from the floor of the cookery." But here, in the Spare Room, the keycard is on the floor. So maybe that's the passkey. Therefore, the user should pick it up now. The next action is to pick up the keycard.
