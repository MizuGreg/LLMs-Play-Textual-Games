Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, venture east. If you can accomplish that, lift the nest of earwigs from the floor of the attic. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Cubicle =-
You are in a cubicle. A standard one. The room is well lit.

You can see a safe. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You can make out a table. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is an open passageway leading east. There is an open portal leading north. There is an open hatch leading west. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Attic =-
You've stumbled into an usual room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be usual. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the attic.

You make out a workbench. The workbench is typical. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is an open passageway leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

There is a nest of earwigs on the floor.

That's not a verb I recognise.

Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and perform specific actions. The goal is to lift the nest of earwigs from the attic.

First, the user started in the Cubicle, went east to the Attic. The Attic has a nest of earwigs on the floor. The user tried to "lift the nest of earwigs from the floor of the attic," but the system said that's not a recognized verb. Hmm, maybe the correct command is just "lift the nest" or "pick up the nest"? The game might expect a simpler command without the extra description.

Wait, in text adventures, sometimes you have to use specific verbs. Maybe "take" instead of "lift"? Or maybe "lift" is allowed but the syntax is different. The user's previous attempt was "lift the nest of earwigs from the floor of the attic." The game might not accept that because it's too wordy or the exact phrasing is wrong. Maybe just "lift nest" or "lift the nest"?

Also, the user is asked if they think they're making the right actions and if they're close to the goal. Since they're in the Attic and the nest is there, lifting it should be the next step. But the game isn't accepting the command. Maybe the correct command is just "lift nest" without specifying the floor or the attic. Or perhaps "take the nest of earwigs"?

Alternatively, maybe the game expects the player to use the verb "lift" with the object, so "lift nest" is sufficient. Let me check the possible commands again. The user tried "lift the nest of earwigs from the floor of the attic," which was rejected. Maybe the game expects a more concise command. Let's try "lift nest" next.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to complete the game where they need to go east, then lift the nest of earwigs in the attic. The problem is that when they tried "lift the nest of earwigs from the floor of the attic," the system said that's not a recognized verb. Then they tried "lift nest," which also didn't work.

Hmm, maybe the correct command is just "lift nest" without specifying the location, but the system is strict. Alternatively, maybe the game expects a different phrasing. The original instruction was to "lift the nest of earwigs from the floor of the attic." But the system might not accept that exact phrase. Perhaps the game wants a simpler command like "lift" or "take nest."

Wait, the user is supposed to only output the action, like "go north." So maybe the correct command is "lift" or "take nest." But the game might require specifying the object. Let me check the previous interactions. The user tried "lift the nest of earwigs from the floor of the attic," which was rejected. Then "lift nest" was also rejected. Maybe the game expects "lift nest" without the description. But the system still says it's not a verb. Alternatively, maybe the correct action is "take nest" or "pick up nest."

Alternatively, perhaps the game uses a different verb, like "remove" or "pick." But the user's previous attempts were "lift" related. Since the system is not accepting "lift," maybe the correct command is "take nest" or "pick up nest." But the user has to follow the exact command format. The original instruction was to "lift the nest," so maybe the game expects "lift nest" even though it's not a verb. But the system is strict. Alternatively, maybe the game allows "lift" as a verb, but the user needs to specify the object. Wait, the user's previous attempt was "lift nest," which the system rejected. So maybe the correct command is "take nest" or "pick up nest." But the user is supposed to only output the action, so maybe "take nest" is the right command. Alternatively, maybe the game expects "remove nest." But I'm not sure. The user needs to try different verbs. Since the system is not accepting "lift," maybe the correct action is "take" or "pick up." But the user has to follow the exact command. Let me think again. The original goal is to lift the nest. The game might have a specific verb for that. Maybe "lift" is acceptable, but the user needs to use the correct syntax. Alternatively, maybe the game expects "lift the nest" but the system is not recognizing it. But the user tried that and it was rejected. So perhaps the correct command is "take nest." Let me try that.
