Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First stop, take a trip west. And then, attempt to travel south. Once you accomplish that, make an attempt to go to the east. And then, retrieve the key from the floor of the dish-pit. Got that? Good!

-= Washroom =-
Guess what, you are in a place we're calling a washroom.



You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game called TextWorld. Their task is to navigate through different rooms and retrieve a key from the dish-pit. So far, they've moved west, south, north, and east, ending up back in the washroom. The current room is the washroom again, with options to go south or west.

The user's question is whether they're making the right moves and if they're close to the goal. The original task was to go west, then south, then east, and retrieve the key from the dish-pit. Let me track their path:

1. Start in Washroom, go west to Parlor.
2. From Parlor, go south to Lounge.
3. In Lounge, go north back to Parlor.
4. From Parlor, go east back to Washroom.

So they're looping between the washroom and parlor. The key is in the dish-pit, which might be in the Lounge or another room. The user hasn't picked up the key yet. In the Lounge, there was a keycard on the floor. Wait, in the Lounge, the user was told there's a keycard on the floor. But the user went north back to the Parlor and didn't pick it up. So maybe they need to go back to the Lounge to pick up the key.

But the current room is the Washroom again. The user needs to go back to the Lounge. From the Washroom, they can go south to the Lounge. Then pick up the keycard. Then maybe proceed to the dish-pit. But the dish-pit isn't mentioned yet. The original task was to retrieve the key from the floor of the dish-pit. So maybe the keycard is in the Lounge, and the dish-pit is another room.

So the next step would be to go south from the Washroom to the Lounge, pick up the keycard, then find the dish-pit. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the correct next action is to go south from the Washroom to the Lounge. But the user is currently in the Washroom, and the available exits are south and west. The user's last action was go east, which brought them back to the Washroom. So the next step should be to go south to the Lounge again to pick up the keycard. Then proceed to the dish-pit. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the answer should be to go south again.

Wow! You're in a dish-pit.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unblocked exit to the south. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

There is a key on the floor.
