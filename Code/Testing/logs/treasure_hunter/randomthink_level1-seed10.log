Hey, thanks for coming over to TextWorld! Please lift the carrot from the floor of the chamber.

-= Chamber =-
Okay, so you're in a chamber, cool, but is it usual? You better believe it is. You begin looking for stuff.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a carrot on the floor.
