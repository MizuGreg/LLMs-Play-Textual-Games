You are now playing a life changing game of TextWorld! First stop, ensure that the gateway is open. After that, make an effort to move east. Then, open the portal. Then, try to take a trip south. After that, make sure that the passageway is ajar. After opening the passageway, make an effort to travel east. After that, pick-up the nest of earwigs from the floor of the attic. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Bedroom =-
You arrive in a bedroom. An ordinary kind of place. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You see a box. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The box contains a burger, so there's that.

There is a closed gateway leading east. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

-= Recreation Zone =-
You find yourself in a recreation zone. A standard kind of place. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You make out a suitcase. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a locked locker close by. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a shelf. But the thing is empty.

There is a closed portal leading south. There is an open gateway leading west. There is an unguarded exit to the east.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they need to follow specific steps to progress. The current location is the Recreation Zone. The previous actions were opening the gateway and moving east, which led here.

The user has to make sure they're following the correct sequence: open the gateway, move east, open the portal, go south, ensure the passageway is open, move east again, pick up the earwigs, and then stop. So far, they've opened the gateway and moved east, which is correct. Now, in the Recreation Zone, there's a locked locker, a shelf, a closed portal south, an open gateway west, and an unguarded exit east.

The next step according to the instructions is to open the portal. The user has to open the portal leading south. So the next action should be "open portal". But wait, the user might need to check if the portal is accessible. However, the prompt says to follow the steps: after moving east, open the portal, then go south. So the next step is to open the portal. The user is in the Recreation Zone, and the portal is closed, so they need to open it. Then proceed south. So the correct command here is "open portal".

-= Cubicle =-
You are in a cubicle. A standard one. The room is well lit.

You can see a safe. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You can make out a table. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is a closed passageway leading east. There is an open portal leading north. There is an open hatch leading west. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps given in the initial instructions. They started by opening the gateway in the bedroom, then moved east to the recreation zone, opened the portal, went south to the cubicle. Now, in the cubicle, they need to proceed according to the original plan.

The original steps after opening the passageway were to travel east again. The current room is the cubicle, which has a closed passageway leading east. So the next logical step would be to go east. The user has been methodically following each step, so continuing with "go east" makes sense here. The passageway is closed, so they might need to open it next, but according to the original plan, after opening the passageway (which they did in the previous step?), they were supposed to travel east. Wait, looking back, the user opened the portal in the recreation zone, then went south to the cubicle. The cubicle has a closed passageway east. So the next action should be to go east. The user's next move should be "go east" to proceed.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game, and they've been following the steps given. The current scenario is in a Cubicle room. The user tried to go east but was told they need to open the passageway first.

So, the previous actions were: open the gateway in the bedroom, go east to the Recreation Zone, open the portal, go south to the Cubicle. Now, in the Cubicle, they need to open the passageway leading east before they can proceed. The user's next step should be to open that passageway. The game's structure requires each action to be taken in order, ensuring that each obstacle is cleared before moving on. The user is on the right track, following the initial instructions step by step. The next logical command is to open the passageway.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps given in the initial instructions. They started by opening the gateway in the bedroom, then moved east to the recreation zone, opened the portal, went south to the cubicle, opened the passageway, and then moved east again. Now, they're in the cubicle, having opened the passageway leading east. The next step according to the original plan was to pick up the nest of earwigs from the attic. But the current location is the cubicle. Wait, the user hasn't mentioned the attic yet. Let me check the previous steps again.

The original plan was: open gateway, go east, open portal, go south, open passageway, go east, pick up the nest of earwigs. So after opening the passageway in the cubicle, the next action should be to go east into the passageway. But the user just did that, and the system responded with "You have to open the passageway first." Wait, no, the user already opened the passageway. Wait, the user's last action was opening the passageway, and the system's response was "You open passageway." Then the user's next command was "go east," which is allowed now. But the system's response was "You have to open the passageway first." That seems conflicting. Wait, maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Let me retrace.

In the cubicle, after opening the passageway, the user tried to go east. The system's response was "You have to open the passageway first." But the user had just opened the passageway. That seems like a mistake. Wait, maybe the system is indicating that the passageway is closed again? Or perhaps the user made a mistake in the previous step. Wait, the user's previous action was "open passageway," which was successful. Then they tried to "go east," which is allowed because the passageway is now open. But the system's response says "You have to open the passageway first," which is confusing. Maybe there's a bug in the system's response. But regardless, the user's next action should be to go east into the passageway. However, according to the system's message, they need to open the passageway again. But that's not logical. Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to pick up the earwigs from the attic, which is a different location. Wait, the original plan was after opening the passageway, go east, then pick up the nest. But the current location is the cubicle. So maybe the passageway leading east is the one to the attic. So after opening it, the user can go east into the attic. But the system's response is confusing. However, the user's last action was "open passageway," and the system says "You open passageway." Then the user's next command is "go east," which should be allowed. But the system says "You have to open the passageway first." That's conflicting. Maybe the system is indicating that the passageway is closed again. But the user just opened it. This is confusing. However, the user's next action should be to go east into the passageway. So the correct command is "go east."

-= Attic =-
You've stumbled into an usual room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be usual. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the attic.

You make out a workbench. The workbench is typical. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is an open passageway leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

There is a nest of earwigs on the floor.
