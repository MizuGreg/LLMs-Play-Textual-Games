Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Your task for today is to pick-up the latchkey from the floor of the workshop.

-= Workshop =-
You've just sauntered into a workshop.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the north.

There is a gummy bear and a latchkey on the floor.
