Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First stop, make an effort to go west. And then, lift the carrot from the floor of the chamber. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Bedchamber =-
Well, here we are in the bedchamber.



There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

-= Chamber =-
Okay, so you're in a chamber, cool, but is it usual? You better believe it is. You begin looking for stuff.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a carrot on the floor.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, the user is stuck in the game because they're trying to "lift the carrot" but the system says that's not a recognized verb. Let me check the previous interactions.

First, the user was in the Bedchamber, went west to the Chamber, and there's a carrot on the floor. The task was to lift the carrot. But the system keeps rejecting "lift the carrot". Maybe the correct verb is "take" instead of "lift"? In many text adventures, "take" is the standard command for picking up items. Let me confirm the game's possible commands. Since the user has tried "lift" multiple times and it's not working, the next logical step is to try "take the carrot". That should be the correct verb here. So the next action should be "take the carrot".
