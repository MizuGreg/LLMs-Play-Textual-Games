It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! First step, make an effort to travel south. If you can get through with that, lift the stick of butter from the floor of the cubicle. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Bedroom =-
You've moved into an usual room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be usual. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the bedroom. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.



There is an open gateway leading south. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to solve this text-based game. The goal is to lift the stick of butter in the cubicle. The user first went south, which led them to the cubicle. Then they tried to lift the stick of butter, but the system said that's not a recognized verb. They tried "lift the butter" again, which also didn't work. Now they're asking if they're making the right actions and if they're close to the goal.

Hmm, the problem might be with the command syntax. The game might expect a specific verb. In many text adventures, the correct command would be "take" instead of "lift". So maybe the user should try "take the stick of butter" or "take the butter". Let me check the previous interactions. The user tried "lift the stick of butter" and then "lift the butter". The game didn't accept those. So perhaps the correct verb is "take".

Also, the user is in the cubicle, and the stick of butter is on the floor. The correct action would be to pick it up. Since "lift" isn't working, switching to "take" might be the solution. The user needs to use the right command syntax. So the next action should be "take the butter" or "take the stick of butter". Since the game might accept "take" as the verb, that's the right move. The user is on the right track, just needs to use the correct command.
