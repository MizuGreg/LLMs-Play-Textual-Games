Welcome to TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, you could, like, attempt to go to the south. Then, head west. Then, lift the carrot from the floor of the chamber. That's it!

-= Attic =-
You have entered an attic. Not the attic you'd expect. No, this is an attic. The room is well lit.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

There is a latchkey on the floor.

-= Bedchamber =-
Well, here we are in the bedchamber.



There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

go west

-= Chamber =-
Okay, so you're in a chamber, cool, but is it usual? You better believe it is. You begin looking for stuff.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a carrot on the floor.

That's not a verb I recognise.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me figure out what to do next. The user tried to lift the carrot, but the game said that's not a recognized verb. Hmm, maybe "lift" isn't the correct command here. Let me check the available actions.

In the Chamber, the user is supposed to lift the carrot from the floor. But the game might expect a different verb. Maybe "take" instead of "lift"? Or perhaps "pick up"? Wait, the user tried "lift" and it didn't work. So maybe the correct command is "take the carrot" or just "take" if the carrot is in the inventory.

Wait, the game's previous messages mention that the user needs to "lift the carrot from the floor of the chamber." But the system rejected "lift." Maybe the correct action is "take the carrot" or "get the carrot." Alternatively, maybe the game expects the user to use "pick up" instead. Let me think about common command verbs in text adventures. Typically, "take" is the standard verb for picking up items. So maybe the correct command is "take the carrot."

But the user's previous attempt was "lift the carrot," which didn't work. So perhaps the correct command is "take the carrot." Let me try that. Alternatively, maybe the game is case-sensitive, so "Lift" with a capital L? But the user used lowercase. Alternatively, maybe the game expects "pick up the carrot." But the user was told to "lift the carrot," so maybe the game is expecting "lift" but it's not working. Maybe there's a typo or a different verb.

Alternatively, maybe the game is expecting the user to just "take" without specifying the object. But the carrot is on the floor, so the user needs to pick it up. Since "lift" didn't work, perhaps the correct command is "take the carrot." Let me try that. So the next action should be "take the carrot."
