Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First, it would be fantastic if you could travel north. Next, venture east. With that over with, travel east. With that accomplished, pick-up the bug from the floor of the kitchenette. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Shower =-
I am sorry to announce that you are now in the shower.



There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

-= Basement =-
You arrive in a basement. A normal one.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a broom on the floor.

You are in a bedroom. A typical kind of place.



There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text adventure game, and they've been given a series of commands to follow. The goal is to travel north, then east, then east again, pick up the bug from the kitchenette, and win.

So far, the user has gone north from the shower into the basement, then east into the bedroom. Now they're in the bedroom. The next step according to the original instructions was to travel east again. The current room is the bedroom, which has an unblocked exit to the east and an unguarded exit to the west. 

Wait, the original instructions said after going east twice, they should pick up the bug in the kitchenette. But the user is now in the bedroom. Maybe the kitchenette is another room they need to reach. But the current room is the bedroom. The exits here are east and west. The user needs to go east again to proceed. Let me check the previous steps again.

Original steps: go north (shower -> basement), then east (basement -> bedroom), then east again (bedroom -> ?). The next room after the bedroom east would be... Well, the user hasn't been there yet. So the next logical step is to go east again from the bedroom. That would take them to the next room, which might be the kitchenette where the bug is. So the correct next action is to go east again. The user's next move should be "go east".

-= Kitchenette =-
You've entered a kitchenette. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.



There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

There is a bug on the floor.

That's not a verb I recognise.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to complete the game. They've gone north, then east, then east again, ending up in the Kitchenette. The goal was to pick up the bug and then win. The user tried "pick-up bug" but the system said that's not a recognized verb.

Hmm, maybe the correct command is "pick up" without the hyphen. Let me check the previous interactions. The user wrote "pick-up bug", but the game might expect "pick up". So the correct action is to pick up the bug using the correct verb form.

After picking up the bug, the user should win. So the next step is to correct the command to "pick up bug" and then proceed. Since the user is asking if they're close, they probably need to do that action again with the right wording.
