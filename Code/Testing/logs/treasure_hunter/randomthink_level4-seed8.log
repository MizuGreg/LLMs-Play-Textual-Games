Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an fast paced round of TextWorld? You do! Here is your task for today. Your first objective is to make an effort to move east. Okay, and then, recover the shoe from the floor of the attic. Alright, thanks!

-= Cubicle =-
You are in a cubicle. An ordinary one. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

-= Attic =-
Well, here we are in the attic.



There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

There is a latchkey and a shoe on the floor.
