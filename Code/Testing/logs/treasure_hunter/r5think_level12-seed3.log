Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to make an effort to go south. With that done, head west. And then, lift the worm from the floor of the kitchenette. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Bar =-
You've entered a bar. You can barely contain your excitement.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

A well framed board tells you that you are now in the kitchenette.

You smell a sickening smell, and follow it to a saucepan. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

There is a worm on the floor.

That's not a verb I recognise.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game called TextWorld. The goal seems to be to pick up the worm from the kitchenette and put it in a place, but the user has already tried lifting the worm and got an error.

First, the user followed the instructions: go south from the bar, then west to the laundromat, then west again to the kitchenette. In the kitchenette, there's a worm on the floor. The user tried to "lift the worm," but the game said that's not a recognized verb. So maybe the correct command is different.

In text adventures, common verbs are "take," "pick up," "get," "put," "drop," etc. Since "lift" didn't work, maybe "take" is the right verb here. The worm is on the floor, so the player needs to pick it up. The error message suggests that "lift" isn't a valid command, so the correct action is probably "take the worm" or "pick up the worm."

The user's next step should be to use the correct verb. The game might expect "take" instead of "lift." So the next action should be "take the worm." After that, the user might need to put it in a specific location, like the laundromat or the bar, but according to the initial instructions, the goal was to lift the worm and stop. So once the worm is picked up, the user can stop.

Wait, the original instructions said: "Once that's all handled, you can stop!" So after lifting the worm, the user can end the game. But the user might need to confirm that the worm was successfully picked up. However, the game's response to "lift the worm" was an error, so the correct command is "take the worm."

So the next action is "take the worm." Then, the user can stop. The user should check if that's the correct command. Since the game didn't accept "lift," "take" is the right choice.
