Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First, it would be great if you could make an attempt to travel west. With that over with, take a trip north. That done, try to move north. And then, pick-up the knife from the floor of the cookhouse. Alright, thanks!

-= Pantry =-
You are in a pantry. A typical kind of place.



There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

There is a sock on the floor.
