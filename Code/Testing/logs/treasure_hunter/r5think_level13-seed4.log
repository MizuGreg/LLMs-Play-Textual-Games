It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! First thing I need you to do is to venture east. If you can get around to doing that, attempt to travel south. Following that, travel south. Then, retrieve the napkin from the floor of the scullery. Alright, thanks!

-= Shower =-
You find yourself in a shower. A typical kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

You can see a closed box in the room. You make out a locked safe.

There is an open door leading east. There is an unguarded exit to the south. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

-= Cookery =-
You are in an usual kind of place. That is to say, you're in a cookery.

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a table. On the table you can make out a stick of butter. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now.

There is an open portal leading south. There is an open door leading west.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text adventure game, and they've been moving through different rooms: shower, cookery, canteen. Their goal seems to be to retrieve a napkin from the scullery.

First, the initial instructions said to go east, then south, then south again, and finally get the napkin from the scullery. So far, they've gone east from the shower into the cookery, then south to the canteen. The next step would be to go south again from the canteen. The canteen has an unguarded exit to the south, so that's probably the way to go. 

The user is now at the canteen. The next action should be to go south. The response should just be "go south" again. The user might be confused if they think they need to do something else, but according to the plan, after the canteen, the next step is to head south again. Then, once they reach the scullery, they can pick up the napkin. So the correct next command is "go south".
</think>go south

-= Scullery =-
You arrive in a scullery. A standard one.

You make out a closed refrigerator here.

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

There is a napkin on the floor.
