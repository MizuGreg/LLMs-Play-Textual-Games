It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First off, try to go east. After that, ensure that the portal inside the spare room is open. After that, venture north. Then, doublecheck that the gate is open. After that, make an effort to go to the east. Then, recover the stick of butter from the floor of the cubicle. Got that? Good!

-= Bedchamber =-
You are in a bedchamber. A normal one.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Spare Room =-
You arrive in a spare room. A standard kind of place.

You make out a toolbox. The toolbox is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a coffer. Oh, great. Here's a display. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. This always happens!

There is a closed portal leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

There is a passkey on the floor.

-= Attic =-
Well, here we are in the attic.

You see a safe. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can see a shelf. However, the shelf, like an empty shelf, has nothing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

You have to open the portal first.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in the Spare Room again after going west and then back to the Spare Room. The main goal mentioned earlier was to ensure the portal inside the spare room is open. The user tried going north, but the portal is closed. So the next step should be to open the portal.

Looking at the items in the Spare Room, there's a passkey on the floor. The passkey might be needed to open the portal. The user hasn't picked it up yet. So the logical action would be to pick up the passkey first. Then, use it to open the portal leading north. 

Wait, the user's previous action was "go north", but the system responded that the portal is closed. So the user needs to find a way to open it. The passkey is present here, so picking it up is necessary. Then, maybe use the passkey to open the portal. But the command format requires a single action. Since the passkey is on the floor, the first step is to take it. Then, after having the passkey, try opening the portal. But according to the instructions, each turn is a single command. So the next action should be to pick up the passkey. Let me check the previous messages. The user is in the Spare Room again, and the passkey is on the floor. So the correct next step is to take the passkey. Then, after that, use it to open the portal. But the user's next action should be "take passkey" or "pick up passkey". However, in the game's context, the available commands might be more limited. The user has to interact with the environment. Since the passkey is on the floor, the correct command is to take it. Then, after that, use it to open the portal. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action is to take the passkey.
