Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an profound round of TextWorld? You do! Here is your task for today. First thing I need you to do is to go to the south. If you can finish that, make an effort to take a trip south. And then, try to venture east. Once you finish that, make an attempt to head north. Following that, head north. After that, attempt to travel east. Then, pick up the latchkey from the pan. Alright, thanks!

-= Dish-Pit =-
Well I'll be, you are in a place we're calling a dish-pit. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.



There is an open door leading north. There is an open passageway leading south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Laundry Place =-
You have walked into a laundry place. Not the laundry place you'd expect. No, this is a laundry place. You begin looking for stuff.

You can see an opened cabinet, which looks ordinary, in the corner. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You make out a table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

There is an open portal leading east. There is an open hatch leading north.

Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game called TextWorld, and they've been given a series of directions to move through different rooms. The goal seems to be to reach a certain point, maybe to pick up an item or exit the game.

First, the user started in the Dish-Pit, went south to the Recreation Zone, then south again to the Laundry Place. Now, they're in the Laundry Place, which has an open portal east and a hatch north. The user's last action was going south from the Recreation Zone to the Laundry Place. The current room is the Laundry Place.

The user's next step is to decide whether to go east or north. The original instructions mentioned going south, then east, then north, then north again, then east, and finally pick up the latchkey from the pan. But the user is now in the Laundry Place. Let me check the directions again.

In the Laundry Place, there's an open portal east and an open hatch north. The user's previous moves were south, south. The next steps in the original plan were to go east, then north, then north, then east. But maybe the user needs to follow the path that leads to the latchkey. The user is supposed to pick up the latchkey from the pan, which might be in a different room.

Looking at the rooms so far: Dish-Pit (south to Recreation Zone, then south to Laundry Place). From Laundry Place, going east would take them through the portal, and north would take them back through the hatch. The original plan says after going south twice, they should venture east. So maybe the next step is to go east from the Laundry Place. But the user is supposed to go east, then north, then north, then east. However, the user is now in the Laundry Place, so the next action should be to go east. But the user's last move was south, so they need to go east next. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go north first, but that would take them back to the Recreation Zone.

Wait, the original instructions said: after going south twice, try to venture east. So from the Laundry Place, go east. The user's next action should be to go east. But the user is in the Laundry Place, so the command would be "go east". However, the user's last move was going south, so the next step is to go east. Let me check the current room's description again. The Laundry Place has an open portal east and an open hatch north. So going east is possible. Therefore, the next action should be "go east".

-= Bedroom =-
Guess what, you are in a place we're calling a bedroom. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.



There is an open gate leading north. There is an open portal leading west.

There is a loaf of bread on the floor.


>                                                                                                                                -= Bedroom =-0/4

-= Bathroom =-
You find yourself in a bathroom. A standard kind of place.

Were you looking for a board? Because look over there, it's a board. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is an open gateway leading north. There is an open gate leading south.

-= Cubicle =-
I am sorry to announce that you are now in the cubicle.

You see a coffer. You make out an opened trunk. The trunk is empty! What a waste of a day!

There is an open gateway leading south. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east.



>                                                                                                                                -= Cubicle =-0/6

Okay, let's see. The user is playing a text adventure game, and they've been moving through different rooms: Dish-Pit, Recreation Zone, Laundry Place, Bedroom, Bathroom, and now Cubicle. The original task was to go south, then east, north, north, east, and pick up the latchkey from the pan. But so far, the user has followed the path: south, south, east, north, north, and now they're in the Cubicle.

In the Cubicle, the description mentions a coffer and an opened trunk that's empty. The user is told to try going east. The previous actions have been moving north and south, but the goal is to find the latchkey. The user hasn't picked up anything yet. The current room is Cubicle, and the available exits are south and east. The user's next move should be east, as per the hint in the room description. But wait, the user's last action was going north again. So maybe the next step is to go east from the Cubicle. However, the user's task was to pick up the latchkey from the pan. The pan wasn't mentioned in the Cubicle description. Maybe the latchkey is in another room. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check the coffer or trunk, but they're empty. The user might need to backtrack. But according to the instructions, after the Cubicle, the next step is to go east. So the correct action here is to go east.

-= Cookhouse =-
Wow! You're in a cookhouse. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You make out a pan. The pan is ordinary. On the pan you see a latchkey. You scan the room, seeing a bowl. However, the bowl, like an empty bowl, has nothing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the bowl.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.
