Welcome to TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First step, attempt to go north. After that, try to take a trip north. After that, pick-up the passkey from the floor of the cookery. That's it!

You arrive in a cookhouse. A typical one.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.
