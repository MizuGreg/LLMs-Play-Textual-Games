Welcome to TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, attempt to travel west. Once you accomplish that, pick-up the worm from the floor of the kitchenette. Alright, thanks!

-= Laundromat =-
You are in a laundromat.



There is an unguarded exit to the north. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Kitchenette =-
A well framed board tells you that you are now in the kitchenette.

You smell a sickening smell, and follow it to a saucepan. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

There is a worm on the floor.
