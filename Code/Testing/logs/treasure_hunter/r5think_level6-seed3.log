Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First, it would be fantastic if you could venture west. If you can get through with that, travel west. With that accomplished, pick-up the broom from the floor of the basement. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Kitchenette =-
You've entered a kitchenette. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.



There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

>                                                                                                                                -= Kitchenette =-0/1
AGENT -------------------------------------------------

GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Bedroom =-
You are in a bedroom. A typical kind of place.



There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an unguarded exit to the west.



>                                                                                                                                -= Bedroom =-0/2
AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go west
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Basement =-
You arrive in a basement. A normal one.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a broom and a fly larva on the floor.


>                                                                                                                                -= Basement =-0/3
SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me figure out what to do next. The user is in the basement, and there's a broom on the floor. The goal is to pick up the broom and then win. The previous steps were going west from the kitchenette, then west again into the bedroom, and now the basement. The current room is the basement, and the user needs to get the broom.

In the basement description, there's a broom and a fly larva. The user needs to pick up the broom. But the commands available are directions: east, south, west, or north. Wait, the user hasn't picked up the broom yet. So maybe the next step is to pick up the broom. But how? The game might require using a command like 'take broom' or something similar. However, the user's previous commands were just 'go west' and 'go west' again. The user might need to use a different command to pick up the broom. But the instructions said to only output the action, like "go north". So maybe the correct action here is to pick up the broom. But the user hasn't been told that they can pick up items. Wait, in TextWorld games, usually, you can pick up items by using the 'take' command. But the user's previous actions were moving, so maybe the next step is to take the broom. However, the user's last message says to only output the command, so maybe the answer is 'take broom'. But the user is in the basement, and the broom is on the floor. So the correct action is to take the broom. But I need to check the previous steps again. The user was told to pick up the broom from the basement. So the next step is to take the broom. But the user's previous commands were moving, so maybe the next command is 'take broom'. However, the user might have to be in the correct position. Since the user is already in the basement, the broom is there. So the next action is to take the broom. Therefore, the answer should be 'take broom'.
