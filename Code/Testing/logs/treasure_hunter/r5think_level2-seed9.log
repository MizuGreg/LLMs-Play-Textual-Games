Hey, thanks for coming over to TextWorld! Please recover the teapot from the floor of the canteen.

-= Canteen =-
You've entered a canteen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.



You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a keycard and a teapot on the floor.
