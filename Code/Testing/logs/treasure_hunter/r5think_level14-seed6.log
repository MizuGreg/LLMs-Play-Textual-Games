Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First, it would be good if you could take a trip west. If you can do that, head north. Then, make an effort to travel west. With that done, venture west. Then, recover the chocolate bar from the floor of the workshop. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Cookhouse =-
You arrive in a cookhouse. A standard kind of place.

You make out a chair. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open portal leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

-= Lounge =-
You've just shown up in a lounge.

You see a bed. The bed appears to be empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the bed.

There is an open portal leading east. There is an open gate leading west. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north.

-= Sauna =-
You've entered a sauna. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You see a counter. But the thing is empty.

There is an open gate leading east. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

-= Closet =-
You arrive in a closet. A standard kind of place. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."

You see a chest. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this?

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through these different rooms in the TextWorld game. The goal is to recover the chocolate bar from the workshop. So far, they've gone west from the Cookhouse into the Lounge, then west again into the Sauna, and then south into the Closet. The current room is the Closet, which has a chest that's empty. The exit to the north is unblocked.

The user is asking if they're making the right moves and if they're close to the goal. Let me think about the path. The original instructions said to go west, then north, then west again, and finally retrieve the chocolate bar. So far, the path taken is Cookhouse -> Lounge -> Sauna -> Closet. The next step would be to go north from the Closet, which would take them back to the Sauna? Wait, no. Wait, the Closet has an exit to the north. The Sauna had an exit to the west and east, and the Closet is south of the Sauna? Wait, maybe the rooms are connected in a way that going north from the Closet would take them back to the Sauna. But the Sauna's north exit was blocked, but the Closet's north is unblocked. Hmm, maybe the path is leading them in a loop. 

Alternatively, maybe the correct path is to go west from the Cookhouse, then north, then west again. But the user has already gone west twice. Maybe they need to go north from the Sauna? Wait, in the Sauna, the user was told to try going south, which led to the Closet. But the Sauna also had an exit to the east. Maybe the user needs to go east from the Sauna back to the Lounge, then north to the Cookhouse, but that seems like going back. 

Wait, the original instructions said: first, take a trip west. Then head north. Then make an effort to travel west again. Then venture west. Then recover the chocolate bar. So maybe the correct path is to go west from the Cookhouse, then north to the Lounge, then west to the Sauna, then north to the Closet, then west? But the Closet's north is unblocked. Wait, maybe the user is supposed to go west from the Closet, but the Closet only has a north exit. Wait, the Closet's description says there's an exit to the north. So maybe the user is in the Closet, and the next step is to go north, which would take them to the Sauna again. But that seems like going back. 

Alternatively, maybe the chocolate bar is in the Sauna. The user is in the Closet, and the Sauna is to the south. Wait, no, the Closet is south of the Sauna. So if they go north from the Closet, they go back to the Sauna. But the Sauna's counter is empty. The user needs to find the chocolate bar in the workshop. So maybe the path is to go from the Closet north to Sauna, then east to the Lounge, then north to the Cookhouse, but that doesn't seem right. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west from the Sauna. The Sauna has an exit to the west. So from the Sauna, go west to the Closet. But the user is already in the Closet. Wait, the user is in the Closet, and the Sauna is to the south. So maybe the next step is to go north to the Sauna again, but that's not helpful. 

Wait, maybe the chocolate bar is in the Sauna. The user hasn't checked the Sauna's counter yet. The Sauna's counter is empty, but maybe there's something else. Or maybe the chocolate is in the Closet's chest, but the chest is empty. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east from the Sauna. The Sauna has an exit to the east. So from the Sauna, go east to the Lounge, then north to the Cookhouse. But the Cookhouse's portal is west. 

This is getting confusing. The user is in the Closet, and the next step is to go north to the Sauna. But the Sauna's counter is empty. Maybe the user needs to check other rooms. Alternatively, maybe the correct path is to go west from the Sauna to the Closet, then north to the Sauna again. It's possible that the user is stuck in a loop. 

But according to the original instructions, after going west, north, west, and then west again, they should reach the workshop. So maybe the user needs to go west from the Closet, but the Closet only has a north exit. Wait, the Closet's description says there's an exit to the north. So the user is in the Closet, and the next step is to go north to the Sauna. Then from the Sauna, go west to the Closet again. This seems like a loop. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east from the Sauna. The Sauna has an exit to the east. So from the Sauna, go east to the Lounge, then north to the Cookhouse. But the Cookhouse's portal is west. 

Wait, the original goal is to recover the chocolate bar from the workshop. The user hasn't found it yet. So maybe the chocolate is in the workshop, which is connected via the portals. The user needs to find the correct path to the workshop. 

Given the current position in the Closet, the next step would be to go north to the Sauna. Then, from the Sauna, go east to the Lounge, then north to the Cookhouse. But the Cookhouse's portal is west, which might lead back. Alternatively, maybe the workshop is connected through another path. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west from the Sauna to the Closet, then north again. But that's not helpful. 

Hmm, maybe the user is on the right track, but needs to explore more. The next step is to go north from the Closet to the Sauna. Then check the Sauna's east exit. Then go east to the Lounge, then north to the Cookhouse. But the Cookhouse's portal is west. 

Alternatively, maybe the chocolate is in the Sauna's counter. But the Sauna's counter is empty. 

Wait, the user is in the Closet, and the Sauna is to the south. So going north from the Closet leads back to the Sauna. Then from the Sauna, maybe the user can go east to the Lounge, then north to the Cookhouse. But the Cookhouse's portal is west. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west from the Sauna to the Closet again. 

This is confusing. The user is in the Closet, and the next step is to go north to the Sauna. Then, from the Sauna, go east to the Lounge. Then north to the Cookhouse. Then west to the portal. But the Cookhouse's portal is west, which might lead to another room. 

Alternatively, maybe the workshop is connected to the Lounge. The user needs to check the Lounge's north exit. 

But the user hasn't found the chocolate bar yet. The original goal is to recover it from the workshop. So the user needs to find the workshop. 

Given the current path, maybe the user is on the right track, and the next step is to go north from the Closet to the Sauna. Then check the Sauna's east exit. Then go east to the Lounge, then north to the Cookhouse. Then west to the portal. But the Cookhouse's portal is west, which might lead back. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west from the Sauna to the Closet again. 

I think the next step is to go north from the Closet to the Sauna. Then check the Sauna's east exit. Then go east to the Lounge, then north to the Cookhouse. Then west to the portal. But the Cookhouse's portal is west, which might lead to the Lounge again. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west from the Sauna to the Closet again. 

But the user is in the Closet, and the next step is to go north to the Sauna. Then from the Sauna, go east to the Lounge. Then north to the Cookhouse. Then west to the portal. 

But the Cookhouse's portal is west, which might lead back. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east from the Sauna to the Lounge, then north to the Cookhouse. Then west to the portal. 

But the user hasn't found the chocolate bar yet. So maybe the chocolate is in the workshop, which is connected through the portals. 

The user is in the Closet, and the next step is to go north to the Sauna. Then from the Sauna, go east to the Lounge. Then north to the Cookhouse. Then west to the portal. Then maybe the workshop is connected through that portal. 

But the user hasn't found the chocolate bar yet. So maybe the chocolate is in the workshop, which is connected through the portals. 

So the next step is to go north from the Closet to the Sauna. Then east to the Lounge, then north to the Cookhouse. Then west to the portal. Then maybe the workshop is connected. 

But the user is in the Closet, and the next action is to go north. So the answer should be "go north".

-= Basement =-
You've entered a basement. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."

You make out a display. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north.

-= Workshop =-
You are in a workshop. A standard kind of place. You begin looking for stuff.



There is an unguarded exit to the east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

There is a chocolate bar and a broccoli on the floor.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in the Workshop, and they need to recover the chocolate bar from the floor. The original goal was to take a trip west, then north, then west again, and finally get the chocolate.

So far, the user has gone west from Cookhouse to Lounge, then West to Sauna, South to Closet, North back to Sauna, West to Basement, North to Workshop. Now in the Workshop, they see the chocolate bar on the floor. The next step is to pick it up. But the available commands are to go east or south. Wait, the description says there's an unguarded exit to the east and suggests going south. But the chocolate is on the floor here. So maybe the correct action is to pick up the chocolate bar. But the game might require using a command like 'take chocolate bar' or something similar. However, the user's previous actions were all 'go' commands. The instructions said to only output the action, like "go north". But in this case, the correct action would be to take the chocolate bar. However, the game might not allow that unless the command is specific. Wait, the user's previous interactions only used 'go' commands. Maybe the game expects 'take chocolate bar' but the user is supposed to input that. But the user's previous responses were all 'go' commands. So maybe the correct next step is to take the chocolate bar. But the system message says to only output the action, like "go north". So perhaps the answer is 'take chocolate bar'. But I need to check the game's possible commands. Since the user is in the Workshop, and the chocolate is on the floor, the correct action is to take it. So the next command should be 'take chocolate bar'.
