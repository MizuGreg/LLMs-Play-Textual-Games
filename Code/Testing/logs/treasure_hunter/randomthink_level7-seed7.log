Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First stop, take a trip west. And then, attempt to travel south. Once you accomplish that, make an attempt to go to the east. And then, retrieve the key from the floor of the dish-pit. Got that? Good!

-= Washroom =-
Guess what, you are in a place we're calling a washroom.



You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they have to navigate through different rooms and complete tasks. The goal mentioned was to first go west, then south, then east, retrieve the key from the dish-pit, and presumably reach the original goal, which might be escaping or reaching a specific location.

So far, the user has moved through the following rooms: Washroom (started here), then Parlor, then Lounge, back to Parlor, and then back to Washroom. The current room is Washroom again. The user is at step 0/5, which might indicate that they have completed 5 steps out of some total, but the exact goal isn't clear. However, the original task was to take a trip west, then south, then east, then get the key from the dish-pit.

Looking at the current room (Washroom), the user is told there's an unguarded exit to the west and south. The previous moves were: go west (from Washroom to Parlor), then south (to Lounge), then north (back to Parlor), then east (back to Washroom). Now, the user is back in the Washroom. The key was found in the Lounge, but the user hasn't picked it up yet. The original task was to retrieve the key from the dish-pit, which might be in the Lounge or another room.

Wait, in the Lounge, there was a keycard on the floor. The user hasn't picked it up yet. So the next step would be to pick up the keycard. But the current room is Washroom. The user needs to get to the Lounge again to pick up the key. However, the user is in the Washroom now. The exits from Washroom are south and west. Going south would take them back to the Parlor, then maybe east to the Lounge again. Alternatively, maybe the key is already in the Washroom? But the key was mentioned in the Lounge.

So the user needs to go from Washroom to Parlor (south), then east to Lounge, pick up the key, and then proceed. But the user hasn't done that yet. The current step is 0/5, which might be a count of the original tasks. The original task was to go west, then south, then east, then get the key. The user has done west (to Parlor), then south (to Lounge), then east (back to Washroom). So maybe the next step is to go north from the Lounge to get the key. But the user is in the Washroom now. So the user needs to go back to the Lounge.

So the next action would be to go south from Washroom to Parlor, then east to Lounge to pick up the key. But the user is in the Washroom, so the immediate next step is to go south to Parlor. Then from Parlor, go east to Lounge. Then pick up the key. Then proceed further. But the user's current position is Washroom, so the next action is to go south to Parlor. But the user is at step 0/5, which might indicate that they have not yet completed the required steps. The user needs to retrieve the key from the dish-pit, which is in the Lounge. So the next action is to go south to Parlor, then east to Lounge, then pick up the key. But the user is in the Washroom, so the next move is to go south.

-= Dish-Pit =-
Wow! You're in a dish-pit.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unblocked exit to the south. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

There is a key on the floor.
