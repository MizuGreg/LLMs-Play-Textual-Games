Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First stop, go to the north. And then, move west. If you can succeed at that, head south. Then, head south. Then, move east. After that, doublecheck that the wooden passageway inside the cubicle is ajar. Then, head east. Then, make an attempt to travel east. Following that, lift the keycard from the floor of the workshop. And once you've done that, you win!

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game and has followed a series of directions to navigate through different rooms. The goal was to eventually lift the keycard from the floor of the workshop and then win. So far, they've moved through the studio, shower, lounge, spare room, bedchamber, cubicle, and laundromat. 

In the laundromat, they found an open wooden passageway leading west and east. The next step in the original instructions was to "doublecheck that the wooden passageway inside the cubicle is ajar," which they did by opening it. Then they were supposed to go east again. After that, they needed to lift the keycard from the workshop floor.

Wait, the current location is the laundromat. The user's last action was going east from the cubicle, which led them to the laundromat. Now, the laundromat has passageways west and east. The next step in the original plan was to "make an attempt to travel east" after checking the passageway. So maybe they need to go east from the laundromat. But the user is asking if they're close to the goal.

Looking at the current room, the laundromat has an open wooden passageway west and east. The original plan was to go east from the cubicle (which they did), then check the passageway, then go east again. But after opening the passageway in the cubicle, they went east to the laundromat. Now, maybe the next step is to go west back through the passageway or east again. But the user's next action should be to go east from the laundromat. However, the user is asking if they're close. The keycard is in the workshop, so they need to find the workshop. Maybe the laundromat is part of the path to the workshop. The user needs to continue moving east to reach the workshop where the keycard is. So the next action would be to go east again from the laundromat. But the user is asking if they're close. The answer is yes, because they've navigated through several rooms and are approaching the workshop. The next step is to go east from the laundromat to reach the workshop. So the correct command is "go east".

-= Workshop =-
You are in a workshop. A standard kind of place. The room is well lit.



There is an open stone gate leading east. There is an open wooden gateway leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked.

There is a keycard on the floor.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to complete the game's objectives. They've followed the steps: go north, west, south, south, east, open the passageway, then east again to reach the workshop. Now, in the workshop, they found a keycard on the floor. The original instruction was to lift the keycard and then win.

But the user keeps getting an error saying "That's not a verb I recognise" when trying to lift the keycard. Wait, maybe the correct command is "pick up keycard" instead of "lift"? Or maybe "take keycard"? The game's vocabulary might use different verbs. Let me check the previous commands. The user tried "lift keycard" multiple times, but the system doesn't recognize it. So perhaps the correct verb is "take" or "get". Alternatively, maybe the keycard is already in the inventory, so the action is just "use keycard" or something else. But the instruction says to "lift the keycard from the floor of the workshop." So the correct action should be "lift keycard". But the system is rejecting it. Maybe the game expects "take keycard" instead. Alternatively, maybe the keycard is not on the floor but somewhere else. Wait, the current room description says "There is a keycard on the floor." So the user needs to pick it up. Since "lift" isn't working, maybe the correct verb is "take". Let me try that. The next action should be "take keycard".
