Welcome to another exciting session of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, make an attempt to head north. Okay, and then, go to the north. Okay, and then, go to the east. If you can finish that, pick up the latchkey from the pan within the cookhouse. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Bedroom =-
Guess what, you are in a place we're calling a bedroom. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.



There is an open gate leading north. There is an open portal leading west.

There is a loaf of bread on the floor.

-= Bathroom =-
You find yourself in a bathroom. A standard kind of place.

Were you looking for a board? Because look over there, it's a board. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is an open gateway leading north. There is an open gate leading south.

-= Cubicle =-
I am sorry to announce that you are now in the cubicle.

You see a coffer. You make out an opened trunk. The trunk is empty! What a waste of a day!

There is an open gateway leading south. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east.

-= Cookhouse =-
Wow! You're in a cookhouse. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You make out a pan. The pan is ordinary. On the pan you see a latchkey. You scan the room, seeing a bowl. However, the bowl, like an empty bowl, has nothing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the bowl.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.



>                                                                                                                                -= Cookhouse =-0/4
SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in the Cookhouse now. The goal is to pick up the latchkey from the pan within the cookhouse and then win. The previous steps were going north from the Bedroom, then to the Bathroom, then to the Cubicle, and now to the Cookhouse.

In the Cookhouse description, there's a pan with a latchkey on it. The user needs to pick that up. The next step should be to pick up the latchkey. But the game's response says "You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west." But the user is already in the Cookhouse, and the pan is here. So maybe the correct action is to pick up the latchkey. However, the game might require moving first. Wait, the user's last action was "go east" to get here. Now, in the Cookhouse, the available actions are probably to pick up the latchkey or go west. Since the goal is to pick up the latchkey, the next command should be to take the latchkey from the pan. But the game might have specific commands. The user needs to pick it up. So the next action is "take latchkey from pan" or something similar. But the user's previous commands were "go north", "go north", "go east". Now, in the Cookhouse, the correct action is to pick up the latchkey. So the next command should be "take latchkey from pan".
