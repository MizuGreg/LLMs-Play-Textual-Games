Welcome to TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First, it would be a great idea if you could venture south. And then, go east. And then, travel north. With that over with, make an effort to go north. With that done, pick-up the passkey from the floor of the cookery. Got that? Good!

-= Spare Room =-
If you're wondering why everything seems so standard all of a sudden, it's because you've just shown up in the spare room.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

There is a keycard on the floor.

-= Cookery =-
You arrive in a cookery. A normal kind of place. You can barely contain your excitement.



You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a passkey on the floor.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game called TextWorld. Their task is to follow specific directions: first venture south, then east, then north, and then pick up the passkey from the cookery. So far, the user has gone south from the spare room to the dish-pit, then east to the cookhouse, then north to the studio, and then north again to the cookery. Now they're in the cookery, and the passkey is on the floor.

The user is asking if they're making the right moves and if they're close to the goal. The next step is to pick up the passkey. The current room is the cookery, and the passkey is there. So the correct action is to pick it up. The game's instructions mention that after going north three times, they should pick up the passkey. Since they're in the cookery now, that's the right place. The next command should be "take passkey" or "get passkey". But in TextWorld, the command might be "take passkey" or "pick up passkey". The user's previous actions were all "go directions", so maybe "take passkey" is the correct command here. The user needs to pick up the passkey from the floor. So the answer should be "take passkey".
