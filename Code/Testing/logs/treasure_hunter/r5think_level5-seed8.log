Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an fast paced round of TextWorld? You do! Here is your task for today. Your first objective is to make an effort to move east. Okay, and then, go to the east. Then, recover the shoe from the floor of the attic. Alright, thanks!

Well, here we are in a study.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked.
