Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First stop, make an attempt to move east. Then, try to move east. Then, move north. With that done, take a trip west. And then, recover the passkey from the floor of the bar. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Chamber =-
You find yourself in a chamber. A standard one. The room is well lit.



There is an unguarded exit to the east.

AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go east
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Laundromat =-
You find yourself in a laundromat. An ordinary kind of place.



There is an unguarded exit to the east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Bar =-
You are in a bar. A normal one.



There is an unblocked exit to the east. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

There is a passkey on the floor.

<think>
Okay, let me figure out what to do next. The user mentioned several steps: move east, then east again, then north, then west, and finally recover the passkey from the bar's floor.

So far, the user has moved from the Chamber to the Laundromat (east), then to the Bar (north). The next step according to the instructions was to take a trip west. But in the Bar, the exit to the east is unblocked, and the passkey is on the floor. The user needs to recover the passkey. 

Looking at the current location, the Bar has an exit to the east and a passkey on the floor. The user's next action should be to pick up the passkey. But the user's previous action was moving north to the Bar. The next step is to get the passkey. So the correct command here is to pick up the passkey. However, in TextWorld, the command would be "take passkey" or "get passkey". But the user's previous actions were movement commands. Wait, the user's last instruction was to "recover the passkey from the floor of the bar." So the next action should be to pick it up. 

But the user's last input was in the Bar, and the passkey is on the floor. So the correct command is to take the passkey. However, the user's previous actions were movement commands. The user might need to check if the passkey is on the floor. The current description says "There is a passkey on the floor." So the next action is to pick it up. Therefore, the correct command is "take passkey" or "get passkey". But in the game's context, maybe "take passkey" is the right command. However, the user's previous actions were movement commands, so maybe the next step is to pick up the passkey. The user's next action should be to take the passkey. But the user's last message says "Once that's all handled, you can stop!" so after getting the passkey, the game is done. So the next action is to take the passkey.
