Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an fast paced round of TextWorld? You do! First stop, make an attempt to travel north. And then, pick up the knife from the floor of the cookhouse. That's it!

-= Shower =-
This might come as a shock to you, but you've just moved into a shower. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.
