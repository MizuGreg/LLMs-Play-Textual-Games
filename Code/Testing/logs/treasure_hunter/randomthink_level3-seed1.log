Welcome to TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First, it would be a great idea if you could attempt to travel north. And then, pick up the passkey from the floor of the cookery. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Studio =-
This might come as a shock to you, but you've just entered a studio.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Cookery =-
You arrive in a cookery. A normal kind of place. You can barely contain your excitement.



You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a passkey on the floor.
