Welcome to TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, you could, like, attempt to go to the south. Then, head west. Then, lift the carrot from the floor of the chamber. That's it!

-= Attic =-
You have entered an attic. Not the attic you'd expect. No, this is an attic. The room is well lit.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

There is a latchkey on the floor.

go south

-= Bedchamber =-
Well, here we are in the bedchamber.



There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

go west
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Chamber =-
Okay, so you're in a chamber, cool, but is it usual? You better believe it is. You begin looking for stuff.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a carrot on the floor.

That's not a verb I recognise.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game called TextWorld. The goal is to lift the carrot in the Chamber. So far, they've gone south, then west, and now they're in the Chamber. The carrot is on the floor, but when they tried to lift it, the system said "That's not a verb I recognise." Wait, maybe the correct command is different. In text adventures, sometimes you have to use specific verbs like 'take' instead of 'lift'. Let me check the previous messages.

The user wrote "lift the carrot", but the system rejected it. Maybe the correct verb is 'take' or 'pick up'. The game's response didn't mention any other verbs, but maybe the system expects 'take'. Let me try that. So the next action should be 'take the carrot'. But the user is supposed to only output the action, nothing else. So the answer should be 'take the carrot'. But wait, the user's last attempt was 'lift the carrot', which was rejected. So maybe the correct verb is 'take'. Let me confirm. In many text adventures, 'take' is the standard verb for picking up items. So the correct command here is probably 'take the carrot'. Therefore, the next action should be that.
</think>take the carrot
