Welcome to another life changing round of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to make an attempt to venture north. That done, move north. Then, take a trip west. Following that, make an effort to head west. Then, take the paper towel from the safe. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Office =-
You are in an office. An ordinary one.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Study =-
You've just sauntered into a study.

As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a case. A closed box, which looks ordinary, is in the corner.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and complete certain tasks. The current room is a Study, and they've tried going west multiple times but can't. The original task was to go north, then west, then west again, take a paper towel from a safe, and stop.

First, the user started in the Office, went north to the Study. Now, they're in the Study. The initial instructions said to move north, then west, then west again. But when they tried going west, it said "You can't go that way." So maybe there's a mistake in the direction they're trying to go.

Looking at the Study description: the user can go north (since the exit is unguarded), south (unblocked), and there's a case in the corner. The exit to the west is unblocked, but maybe the user is trying to go west when they can't. Wait, the user's previous action was "go west" but it's not allowed. Maybe the Study doesn't have a west exit? Or maybe the user is in a position where west is blocked.

Wait, the Study's description says: "You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked." So the exits are north and south. The user tried going west but it's not possible. So maybe the user's next step after the Study is to go north again? But the original plan was to go north, then west, then west. But in the Study, going west is blocked. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the order of directions.

Wait, the original task was: first, go north (from Office to Study), then take a trip west (from Study?), then make an effort to head west again, then take the paper towel from the safe. But maybe the Study doesn't have a west exit. So perhaps the user needs to go north again from the Study, then find another way.

Alternatively, maybe the user is in the Study and needs to go north again to reach another room, then find the west direction from there. But the Study's description says there's an exit to the north. So maybe the next step is to go north again, then check the west direction from that new room.

But the user's last action was trying to go west in the Study, which is blocked. So the next possible action is to go north again. Then, perhaps from the next room (maybe a library or another area), they can go west. Then, after that, proceed to take the paper towel from the safe.

So the correct next action would be to go north from the Study, then proceed west from there. But the user is currently in the Study and can't go west. So the next step is to go north again. Then, from the next room, maybe they can go west. Then, after that, proceed to take the paper towel.

So the answer should be to go north again.
