Welcome to TextWorld! Here is how to play! First of all, make an effort to head north. With that accomplished, ensure that the passageway is open. After that, make an effort to move east. Then, lift the nest of earwigs from the floor of the attic. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Laundry Place =-
This might come as a shock to you, but you've just stumbled into a laundry place. You begin looking for stuff.

You can make out a board. You wonder idly who left that here. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Sometimes, just sometimes, TextWorld can just be the worst.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north.

You are in a cubicle. A standard one. The room is well lit.

You can see a safe. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You can make out a table. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is a closed passageway leading east. There is a closed portal leading north. There is an open hatch leading west. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

<think>
Okay, let me think through this. The user is in a text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and complete specific tasks to win. So far, they started in the Laundry Place, went north into a Cubicle. The Cubicle has a closed passageway east, a closed portal north, an open hatch west, and an exit south. The user tried to go east but was told they need to open the passageway first.

The user is now asking if they're making the right actions and if they're close to the goal. The original goal was to lift the nest of earwigs from the attic. But in the current room (Cubicle), there's a safe, some scurrying movement, a table with nothing on it, and the passageway east is closed. The user's previous action was going east, which wasn't allowed until the passageway is opened.

So, the user needs to figure out how to open the passageway. The possible actions here would be to interact with the safe, check the hatch west, or the exit south. The scurrying might be a hint, maybe the safe is a clue. Alternatively, the hatch west might lead to another part of the game. Since the passageway east is closed, maybe there's a way to open it through another means, like using an object in the room.

The user's next step should be to check the safe or the hatch west. The safe might have a key or something that can open the passageway. Alternatively, the hatch west could lead to a different area where they can find a way to open the east passageway. The exit south might be a dead end, but maybe it leads to another room with more clues.

Considering the game's structure, the user needs to open the passageway east. Since they can't go east yet, they should look for items or ways to open it. The safe might be a good place to check. So the next action should be to open the safe. That makes sense because the safe is a common element in such games that might contain a key or tool needed to proceed.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game, and they've been given some directions. The original goal was to go north, open the passageway, then east, lift the earwigs from the attic, and win. 

First, they started in the Laundry Place, went north to the Cubicle. The Cubicle has a safe, a passageway east that's closed, a portal north, a hatch west, and an exit south. The user tried going east, but it said they had to open the passageway first. Then they opened the safe, which worked.

Now, the question is whether they're on the right track and what the next action should be. The user is asking if they're close to the goal. Let me think about the steps again. The original plan was: go north (which they did), open the passageway (east?), then go east, then lift the earwigs.

But in the Cubicle, after opening the safe, maybe there's something else they need to do. The passageway east is closed, but maybe opening it is the next step. Alternatively, maybe the safe contains a key or something needed to open the passageway. But the user just opened the safe, and the next step might be to check what's inside. However, the game's feedback after opening the safe didn't mention anything else, so maybe the next step is to go east again after opening the passageway.

Wait, the user tried going east before, but it was blocked. Now that they've opened the safe, maybe the passageway is now open? Or maybe opening the safe is a red herring. The original instruction said to open the passageway first. But the user tried going east and was told to open the passageway. Then they opened the safe, which might not be related. So maybe the next step is to try opening the passageway again, or check the portal north.

Alternatively, maybe the safe has a key to open the passageway. But since the game's response after opening the safe didn't mention anything, perhaps the next step is to go east again, assuming the passageway is now open. But the user was told to open the passageway first. So maybe the correct next action is to open the passageway east, but how? Maybe there's a way to open it through the safe? Or maybe the safe is just a distraction.

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go north through the portal. But the original goal was to go north first, then east. So after opening the passageway east, then go east. But the user is in the Cubicle now. The passageway east is closed, so they need to open it. But how? Maybe the safe's contents can be used to open it. But since the game didn't indicate that, maybe the next step is to try opening the passageway again. However, the user already tried going east and was told to open the passageway. So perhaps the correct next action is to open the passageway east, even though the game didn't explicitly say how. But the user's previous action was opening the safe, which might not be the right step. Wait, the user's last action was opening the safe, and the game didn't give any feedback other than that. So maybe the next step is to go east again, assuming that the passageway is now open. But the user was told to open it first. So perhaps the correct next action is to open the passageway east. But how? Maybe there's a key in the safe. But the user hasn't checked the safe's contents. So maybe the next step is to check the safe's contents, but the game doesn't allow that. Alternatively, the user might need to use the key from the safe to open the passageway. But since the game's responses don't mention that, maybe the next step is to go east again, even though it's closed. But the game would block that. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go west through the hatch. But the original goal was to go north, then east. So maybe the correct next step is to go north through the portal. But the user is in the Cubicle, and the portal north is closed. Wait, the Cubicle has a closed portal leading north. So maybe the user needs to open that. But the original instructions didn't mention that. This is confusing. The user's previous action was opening the safe, which might not be the right step. The original plan was to go north, open the passageway, then east. But the user is in the Cubicle, and the passageway east is closed. So maybe the next step is to open the passageway east, but how? Maybe the safe is a red herring, and the user needs to find another way. Alternatively, maybe the user should check the portal north. But the original goal was to go north first. So perhaps the correct next action is to go north through the portal, but it's closed. So the user needs to open it. But how? The game doesn't mention any tools. This is tricky.

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to lift the earwigs from the attic, but that's in the original goal. The user is in the Cubicle, so maybe they need to go north, open the portal, then proceed. But the user is stuck in the Cubicle. The next logical step is to open the passageway east, but the user hasn't done that yet. So perhaps the correct next action is to open the passageway east. But the user tried going east and was told to open it. So maybe the user needs to find a way to open it. Since the safe was opened, maybe the key is in there. But the game didn't indicate that. So maybe the next step is to check the safe's contents, but the game doesn't allow that. Alternatively, the user might need to go west through the hatch. But that's not part of the original plan. 

Hmm, this is a bit confusing. The user is in the Cubicle, and the next step after opening the safe is unclear. The original goal was to go north, open the passageway, then east. So maybe the user should try going east again, assuming that the passageway is now open. But the game's feedback said they had to open the passageway first. So maybe the user needs to open the passageway east. But how? Maybe the safe has a key. But the user hasn't checked. Since the game allows only specific commands, maybe the next action is to open the passageway east. But the user can't do that unless there's a way. Alternatively, the user might need to go north through the portal. But the portal is closed. 

Wait, the user's previous action was opening the safe. Maybe that's a mistake. The original plan was to go north, then open the passageway east. But the user went east first, which was blocked. Then they opened the safe. Maybe that's not the right path. So perhaps the correct next step is to go north through the portal, but it's closed. So the user needs to open it. But how? Maybe there's a way to open it with the key from the safe. But the game doesn't mention that. 

Alternatively, maybe the user should go west through the hatch. But that's not part of the original plan. The original plan was to go north, then east. So maybe the user is on the wrong path. 

This is a bit of a puzzle. The user is in the Cubicle, and the next step should be to open the passageway east. But since they tried going east and were told to open it, maybe the correct action is to open it. But how? Maybe the safe is a red herring, and the user needs to find another way. Alternatively, the user should go north through the portal. But the portal is closed. 

I think the correct next action is to go east again, assuming that the passageway is now open. But the game might block it. However, the user was told to open the passageway first. So maybe the user needs to open it. But the game doesn't provide a command for that. Maybe the user needs to use the key from the safe. But since the game doesn't mention that, perhaps the next action is to go east again. 

Alternatively, the user might need to check the portal north. But the original goal was to go north first. So maybe the correct next action is to go north through the portal. But the portal is closed. 

I'm a bit stuck. But based on the original instructions, the user should go north, open the passageway, then east. So after going north to the Cubicle, the next step is to open the passageway east. But the user tried going east and was told to open it. So maybe the correct next action is to open the passageway east. But the game doesn't have a command for that. So maybe the user should try going east again. 

Alternatively, the user might need to check the safe's contents. But the game doesn't allow that. 

In this case, the user's last action was opening the safe. The next step might be to go east again, even though it's closed, but the game would block it. However, the user is supposed to open the passageway first. So maybe the correct next action is to open the passageway east. But since the game doesn't have a command for that, maybe the user is supposed to go east again. 

Alternatively, maybe the user should go west through the hatch. But that's not part of the original plan. 

I think the correct next action is to go east again, assuming that the passageway is now open. So the user should try going east again.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game, and they've been trying to navigate through different rooms. The goal is to lift the nest of earwigs from the attic and win. So far, they started in the Laundry Place, went north to the Cubicle, tried moving east but had to open the passageway first. Then they opened the passageway, and now they're in the Cubicle again.

The current room is the Cubicle, and the user's last action was opening the passageway. The next step would be to check what's available now. The description mentions a safe, a table, and exits in different directions. The user has already opened the passageway east, so maybe they need to explore further. But the original goal is to get to the attic and lift the earwigs. 

Wait, the initial instructions said after moving east, lift the nest. But in the Cubicle, there's a safe. Maybe opening the safe is part of the process? Or perhaps the passageway leads to another area. The user tried going east again after opening the passageway. The system responded that they have to open the passageway first, but they already did. Maybe the next step is to check the safe or the table. But the user's previous action was opening the passageway, so maybe they need to move east again now that it's open. Alternatively, maybe the safe needs to be opened. But the user just opened the passageway, so perhaps the next logical step is to go east into the passageway. But the user tried that and got the message again. Wait, maybe the passageway is now open, so they can go east. But the system said they have to open it first, but they already did. Maybe the user needs to move east again. Let me check the previous steps.

The user's last action was "open passageway", and the response was "You open passageway." Then the next prompt is to decide the next action. The user is in the Cubicle, with a closed passageway east, a closed portal north, open hatch west, and exit south. After opening the passageway, maybe the east passage is now open. So the next step would be to go east. But the user tried that again and got the same message. Wait, maybe the passageway is a different thing. Maybe the user needs to open the passageway first, which they did, so now they can go east. But the system's message says "You have to open the passageway first" again, which is confusing. Maybe there's a misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps the user needs to check the safe or the table. But the original goal is to lift the earwigs from the attic. So maybe after moving east through the passageway, they'll reach the attic. But the user hasn't moved east yet after opening the passageway. So the next action should be "go east" again. But the system says they have to open the passageway first, but they already did. Maybe the system is confused, but the user should proceed to go east. So the next command is "go east".

-= Attic =-
You've stumbled into an usual room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be usual. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the attic.

You make out a workbench. The workbench is typical. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is an open passageway leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

There is a nest of earwigs on the floor.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to play this text-based game. They've gone through several rooms: the Laundry Place, a Cubicle, and now the Attic. The goal is to lift the nest of earwigs from the attic's floor and win.

In the Attic, they noticed the nest of earwigs on the floor. The previous attempt was to "lift nest of earwigs," but the system said that's not a recognized verb. So, maybe the correct command is different. In text adventures, sometimes you have to use specific verbs like "take" or "pick up" instead of "lift." Let me check the possible commands again.

The user is in the Attic, and the nest is on the floor. The correct action here would likely be "take" or "pick up" the nest. Since the game might expect a specific verb, perhaps "take" is the right choice. The user tried "lift," which didn't work, so switching to "take" might work. Let me confirm: in many text games, "take" is the standard verb for picking up items. So the next action should be "take nest of earwigs."
