It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! First, it would be great if you could try to head east. With that done, go east. With that over with, try to go south. With that over with, take a trip west. Okay, and then, pick-up the worm from the floor of the kitchenette. Alright, thanks!

-= Basement =-
You are in a basement. An ordinary one. You begin to take stock of what's here.

Oh, great. Here's a workbench. The workbench appears to be empty. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

-= Bedroom =-
You're now in a bedroom. You begin looking for stuff.

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a box. You shudder, but continue examining the room.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the north. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

-= Shower =-
You are in a shower. A typical kind of place.

You can see a closed dresser in the room. You can make out a basket. You can see a bench. The bench is ordinary. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a rack. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The rack is typical. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

-= Sauna =-
You have fallen into the most standard of all possible saunas.

You make out a board. The board is ordinary. However, the board, like an empty board, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Kitchenette =-
A well framed board tells you that you are now in the kitchenette.

You smell a sickening smell, and follow it to a saucepan. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

There is a worm on the floor.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game and has been moving through different rooms. The goal mentioned earlier was to pick up the worm from the floor of the kitchenette. So far, they've gone through the basement, bedroom, shower, sauna, and back to the shower, then finally reached the kitchenette.

In the kitchenette, the worm is on the floor. The user's last action was going east, which led them to the kitchenette. Now, the prompt says there's a worm on the floor. The next logical step would be to pick up the worm. But the user needs to check if they can interact with it. Since the game is text-based, the command would likely be "take worm" or "pick up worm". However, the user's previous actions were all about moving, so maybe the game expects a specific command here. The user is also asked if they think they're close to the goal, which suggests that picking up the worm is the final step. So the correct action here is to pick up the worm.
</think>pick up worm
