I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! First of all, you could, like, venture west. And then, open the gate inside the garage. After that, head south. And then, travel south. Then, make an attempt to travel south. And then, lift the chocolate bar from the floor of the chamber. And if you do that, you're the winner!

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game and has followed certain steps. The goal mentioned earlier was to lift the chocolate bar from the chamber and then win. Let me track their current progress.

Starting from the Bedchamber, they went west to the Garage. Opened the crate (found a grape), then opened the gate and went south to the Dish-Pit. Then they went south again to the Kitchenette. Now, in the Kitchenette, there's a freezer, and exits north, east, and south. 

The original plan was to go west, open the gate in the garage, then go south twice, then lift the chocolate. But so far, they've reached the Kitchenette. The next step would be to check if there's a way to proceed towards the chamber where the chocolate is. The Kitchenette has an exit to the east. Maybe that's a path towards the chamber. Alternatively, maybe the freezer has something inside? But the user hasn't interacted with it yet. However, the goal is the chocolate bar in the chamber. So perhaps they need to continue moving south from the Kitchenette? Wait, the Kitchenette has an exit to the south. But the user is already in the Kitchenette, so going south from there would take them back to the Dish-Pit. But the Dish-Pit had a hatch leading south, which might be a different path. Alternatively, maybe the east exit leads to another area. 

Wait, the user's previous steps were: Bedchamber -> Garage -> Dish-Pit -> Kitchenette. The next step would be to check the east exit. But the original plan was to go south twice from the Garage. Wait, maybe the user is off track. Let me check the original instructions again. The user was told to venture west (to the garage), open the gate, then go south, then travel south again, then lift the chocolate. So after opening the gate in the garage and going south to the Dish-Pit, then going south again would take them to the Kitchenette. Then, from there, maybe they need to go east? But the original plan didn't mention that. Alternatively, maybe the Kitchenette is part of the path towards the chamber. But the user hasn't found the chocolate yet. 

Alternatively, maybe the freezer in the Kitchenette has the chocolate? But the user hasn't checked it. However, the original plan was to lift the chocolate from the chamber. So perhaps the user needs to continue moving towards the chamber. Maybe from the Kitchenette, going east leads to the chamber. But the user needs to check. Since the user is in the Kitchenette, the next action would be to go east. But the user's last action was going south to the Kitchenette. So the next step would be to check the east exit. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go north from the Kitchenette back to the Dish-Pit and then proceed further. But the original plan was to go south twice from the Garage. Wait, maybe the user is confused. Let me retrace:

Original steps: 

1. Go west (to Bedchamber) → then open gate in garage (but the user was already in the garage after going west from bedchamber). Wait, the initial instruction said: "venture west. And then, open the gate inside the garage. After that, head south. And then, travel south. Then, make an attempt to travel south. And then, lift the chocolate bar from the floor of the chamber."

So the sequence is: West (to garage), open gate, then go south (to dish-pit), then travel south again (to kitchenette?), then travel south again? But in the current state, the user is in the Kitchenette. So maybe from there, they need to go south again? But the Kitchenette has an exit to the south, which would lead back to the Dish-Pit. But the Dish-Pit has a hatch leading south. So maybe that's the path. However, the user hasn't found the chocolate yet. Alternatively, maybe the chamber is east of the Kitchenette. But the user needs to check. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go east from the Kitchenette. The Kitchenette has an exit to the east. So the next action would be to go east. But the user hasn't done that yet. The user's last action was going south to the Kitchenette. So the next step would be to check the east exit. But the user's goal is to lift the chocolate bar from the chamber. So perhaps the chamber is east of the Kitchenette. Therefore, the next action should be to go east. But the user needs to confirm. Since the user is in the Kitchenette, the possible exits are north, east, south. The user needs to proceed towards the chamber. Since the original plan was to go south twice from the garage, but that led to the Kitchenette. Maybe the chamber is east of the Kitchenette. Therefore, the next action is to go east. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the answer should be to go east.
