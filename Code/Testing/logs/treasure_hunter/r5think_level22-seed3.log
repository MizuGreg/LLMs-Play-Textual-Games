Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, you could, like, venture east. Following that, travel south. With that accomplished, head south. With that over with, travel south. And then, pick up the shadfly from the floor of the laundromat. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Canteen =-
You're now in a canteen.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

-= Lounge =-

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the south. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

-= Laundromat =-
You arrive in a laundromat. A standard one. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."



There is an unblocked exit to the north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

There is a shadfly on the floor.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they need to follow a series of directions to pick up the shadfly from the laundromat and win. So far, they've gone east, south, south, and south again, ending up in the laundromat. The current room is the laundromat, and they've already found the shadfly on the floor.

The next step according to the initial instructions was to pick up the shadfly. But the user hasn't done that yet. The prompt mentions that in the laundromat, there's a shadfly on the floor. So the next action should be to pick it up. However, the user's previous actions were all about moving through the rooms. Now, they need to interact with the environment to pick up the shadfly.

Looking at the current room description, the user is told there's a shadfly on the floor. The available exits are north and west. But the main goal is to pick up the shadfly. Since the user has already reached the laundromat, the next logical step is to pick up the shadfly. The game might require using a command like "pick up shadfly" or "take shadfly" to complete the task. However, the user's previous commands were all movement commands. The game might expect a specific action here.

Wait, the user's last action was "go south" to reach the laundromat. Now, the next step is to pick up the shadfly. The game's feedback says that the shadfly is on the floor, so the user needs to pick it up. The correct command here would be to pick up the shadfly. But the user's instructions mention that they should only output the action, like "go north". So the next action should be "pick up shadfly".

But I need to check if the game allows that action. The previous rooms had exits, but in the laundromat, the user is told there's a shadfly on the floor. So the correct action is to pick it up. Therefore, the next command should be "pick up shadfly".
</think>pick up shadfly
