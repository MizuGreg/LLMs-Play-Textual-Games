Welcome to TextWorld! First off, venture south. If you can get around to doing that, attempt to travel south. Following that, lift the napkin from the floor of the scullery. Alright, thanks!

-= Cookery =-
You are in an usual kind of place. That is to say, you're in a cookery.

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a table. On the table you can make out a stick of butter. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now.

There is an open portal leading south. There is an open door leading west.
