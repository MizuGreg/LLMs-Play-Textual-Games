Welcome to another exciting session of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to make an attempt to venture south. After that, attempt to take a trip south. And then, attempt to take a trip east. With that over with, make an effort to go to the east. And then, lift the keycard from the floor of the workshop. Alright, thanks!

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game called TextWorld. The goal seems to be to reach the original goal, which might be something like finding the keycard in the workshop or escaping the area.

Looking at the current environment, the user is in a cubicle. The description mentions an open wooden passageway leading east and exits to the north and west. The previous steps were going south from the shower to the studio, then south again to the cubicle. The user's task was to go south, then take a trip south, then east, and finally lift the keycard from the workshop floor.

Wait, the current location is the cubicle. The user needs to go east, as per the instructions. The passageway east is mentioned, so maybe that's the way to go. The keycard is in the workshop, so perhaps the cubicle is part of the path leading to the workshop. The user needs to move east from the cubicle to proceed. The next action should be to go east. Then, after moving east, they might find the workshop and lift the keycard. Let me check the previous steps again to make sure. The user was told to go south, then take a trip south, then east, then go east again, and lift the keycard. So after the cubicle, going east would be the next step. The answer should be "go east".
