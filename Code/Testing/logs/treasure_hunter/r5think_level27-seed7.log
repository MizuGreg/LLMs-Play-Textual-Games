Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First stop, head west. That done, try to head south. Following that, venture south. Then, go east. And then, go north. Then, make an attempt to go to the east. If you can do that, take a trip east. Following that, make an attempt to head north. And then, take a trip east. And then, move south. After that, move south. That done, travel west. After that, go west. With that accomplished, take the keycard from the saucepan within the scullery. And if you do that, you're the winner!

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text adventure game, and their goal is to find the keycard in the scullery. So far, they've moved through several rooms: Washroom, Parlor, Lounge, Kitchen, Cookery, Dish-Pit, Vault, Cubicle, and now Cookhouse. The current room is Cookhouse, and there's a garlic clove on the floor.

The user's previous actions followed a specific path: west, south, south, east, north, east, east, and now east again. The next step was to go east from the Cookhouse, but the user is now at Cookhouse and needs to decide the next move. The instructions mention that after reaching the Cookhouse, they should try to go east again, then north, then east, then south, and so on. But the user is asking if they're on the right track and if they're close to the goal.

Looking at the rooms they've visited, the scullery hasn't been mentioned yet. The keycard is in the scullery, so they need to find that. The current room is Cookhouse. The exits from Cookhouse are north, south, and west. The user's next action should be to check those directions. However, the user's previous steps have been moving east, so maybe they need to backtrack or find a different path.

Wait, the user's original plan was: after moving west, south, south, east, north, east, east, then go east again. But in the Cookhouse, going east might not be possible. The description says that in Cookhouse, you can go north, south, or west. So maybe the next step is to go north from Cookhouse. But the user's plan was to go east again. However, the user is now in Cookhouse, and the next step might be to go north to reach the scullery.

Alternatively, maybe the scullery is in a different direction. Let me check the previous rooms. The Vault had exits to east, south, and west. The Cubicle had exits to east, north, south, west. The Cookhouse is a new room. The user needs to find the scullery. The scullery is mentioned in the initial instruction as where the keycard is. So maybe the scullery is connected to the Kitchen or another room.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west from Cookhouse to reach the scullery. Let me think. The user's path so far has them moving through various rooms, but the scullery hasn't been encountered yet. The keycard is in the scullery, so the user needs to find that room. The user's next move should be to check the exits from Cookhouse. The exits are north, south, west. Let's see:

- Going north from Cookhouse: the description says "You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded." So that's possible.

- Going south from Cookhouse: "There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked."

- Going west: "There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded."

So maybe the user should try going west from Cookhouse to reach the scullery. Alternatively, maybe the scullery is in the north. But the user's original plan was to go east again. However, the user is now in Cookhouse, and the next step might be to go west to reach the scullery. Alternatively, maybe the scullery is in the south direction. But the user needs to check.

Alternatively, maybe the user should go north from Cookhouse to reach the scullery. But I need to think about the possible connections. The user's goal is to get to the scullery and take the keycard from the saucepan. So, the user needs to find the scullery. Since the user hasn't been there yet, they need to find the correct path.

In the current room (Cookhouse), the user can go north, south, or west. Let's check the previous rooms. The user was in the Vault, then Cubicle, then Cookhouse. The Vault had an exit to the east (Cookhouse?), so maybe the scullery is connected through another path. Alternatively, maybe the scullery is in the south direction from Cookhouse. But the user needs to check.

Alternatively, maybe the user should go west from Cookhouse to reach the scullery. Let me think. The user's original path was to go west, south, south, east, north, east, east, then east again. But in the Cookhouse, going east might not be possible. The user is now in Cookhouse, and the next step is to go west, north, or south. The user's plan was to go east again, but that might not be possible. So perhaps the user needs to go west from Cookhouse to reach the scullery.

Alternatively, maybe the scullery is in the north direction. But without more information, the user needs to explore the exits. The user's next action should be to go west from Cookhouse, as that's one of the exits. Alternatively, the user could go south. But the user's original plan was to go east again, but that's not possible here. So the user needs to choose between the available exits.

Given that the user is close to the goal, perhaps the next step is to go west from Cookhouse to reach the scullery. Alternatively, maybe the scullery is in the south direction. But the user needs to check. The user's next move should be to go west, as that's one of the exits. So the correct command would be "go west".
