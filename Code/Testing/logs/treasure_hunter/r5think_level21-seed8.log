Welcome to TextWorld! First, it would be good if you could take a trip west. If you can accomplish that, try to move south. Then, retrieve the spork from the floor of the cookery. That's it!

-= Cubicle =-
You are in a cubicle. A normal kind of place.

You can make out a coffer. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. What's that over there? It looks like it's a desk. The desk is normal. However, the desk, like an empty desk, has nothing on it.

There is an open gate leading north. There is an open portal leading west. There is an unguarded exit to the east. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

go west

-= Study =-
You're now in the study.

You make out a closed toolbox in the corner. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a locker. You see a mantle. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's an armchair. The armchair is normal. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open portal leading east. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

-= Cookery =-
You find yourself in a cookery. A typical kind of place.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked.

There is a spork on the floor.
