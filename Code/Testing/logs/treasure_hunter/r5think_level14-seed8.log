Welcome to TextWorld! Here is how to play! First of all, look and see that the portal is ajar. And then, make an effort to head south. With that accomplished, ensure that the passageway is open. After that, make an effort to move east. Then, lift the nest of earwigs from the floor of the attic. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Recreation Zone =-
You find yourself in a recreation zone. A standard kind of place. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You make out a suitcase. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a locked locker close by. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a shelf. But the thing is empty.

There is a closed portal leading south. There is an open gateway leading west. There is an unguarded exit to the east.

-= Cubicle =-
You are in a cubicle. A standard one. The room is well lit.

You can see a safe. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You can make out a table. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is a closed passageway leading east. There is an open portal leading north. There is an open hatch leading west. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Okay, let me think through this. The user is playing a text-based game and has reached the Cubicle room. They've opened the portal to the south and the passageway to the east. The goal is to lift the nest of earwigs from the attic and win.

In the Cubicle, there's a safe, a table with nothing on it, and passages in all directions. The user just opened the passageway east, so the next step would be to move east into that passageway. The original instructions mentioned moving east after opening the portal, then lifting the earwigs. 

But the user is now in the Cubicle. The next logical step is to go east into the newly opened passageway. The user might be close to the attic since the next step after the Cubicle is the attic. So the correct action is to go east again. Wait, but the user just opened the passageway east, so they need to move into it. The previous action was opening the passageway, so the next command should be "go east" to enter that passage. That would lead them towards the attic where the earwigs are. 

Yes, that makes sense. The user is on the right track. The next action is to go east into the passageway.

-= Attic =-
You've stumbled into an usual room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be usual. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the attic.

You make out a workbench. The workbench is typical. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is an open passageway leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

There is a nest of earwigs on the floor.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to play this text-based game. The goal is to lift the nest of earwigs in the attic and then win. But the system is saying that "lift nest of earwigs" isn't a recognized verb.

Hmm, maybe the correct command is different. Let me check the previous interactions. The user tried "lift nest of earwigs" multiple times, and each time it's rejected. So perhaps the game expects a different phrasing. Maybe "pick up" instead of "lift"? Or maybe "take"?

Wait, in some text adventures, the verbs are more specific. Like "take" is often used for picking up items. Let me think. The user is in the attic, and there's a nest of earwigs on the floor. The original instruction said to "lift the nest of earwigs from the floor of the attic." So maybe the correct command is "take nest of earwigs" or "pick up nest of earwigs"?

But the system keeps rejecting "lift". Maybe the game uses "take" as the correct verb. Let me try that. The user might have to use "take" instead of "lift". Alternatively, maybe the item is called something else, like "earwig nest" instead of "nest of earwigs".

Wait, the game's feedback says "That's not a verb I recognise." So the problem is the verb. The user used "lift", which isn't accepted. So the correct verb might be "take" or "pick up". Let me try "take nest of earwigs" next. But the user has to input the exact command. Since the system is strict, maybe the correct command is "take" followed by the item name. Alternatively, maybe the game expects "lift" but the item is not properly named.

Alternatively, maybe the game requires the user to use the exact phrasing as in the initial instruction. The original instruction said "lift the nest of earwigs from the floor of the attic." So perhaps the correct command is "lift nest of earwigs" but the game is case-sensitive or has a typo. Wait, the user has tried that multiple times, and it's still rejected. So maybe the game uses a different verb.

Alternatively, maybe the game is expecting "open" or another action. But the user's goal is to lift the nest. Since the system keeps rejecting "lift", perhaps the correct verb is "take". Let me try that. The next action should be "take nest of earwigs". But the user has to input that. So the answer should be "take nest of earwigs".
