Welcome to TextWorld! Here is how to play! Your first objective is to venture east. And then, go north. And then, travel north. With that over with, pick up the passkey from the floor of the cookery. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Dish-Pit =-
Well, here we are in the dish-pit. You start to take note of what's in the room.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

-= Cookhouse =-
You arrive in a cookhouse. A typical one.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

-= Studio =-
This might come as a shock to you, but you've just entered a studio.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Cookery =-
You arrive in a cookery. A normal kind of place. You can barely contain your excitement.



You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a passkey on the floor.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me think through this. The user is in a text-based game where they need to follow specific steps to pick up the passkey and win. So far, they've gone east from the dish-pit, then north into the cookhouse, then north again into the studio, and now they're in the cookery. The cookery has the passkey on the floor.

The original goal was to venture east, then north, then north again, pick up the passkey, and that's it. The user has already done the first three steps: east, north, north. Now they're in the cookery, which is the fourth step. The next thing to do is pick up the passkey. The prompt says to pick it up from the floor. So the next action should be to pick up the passkey. But wait, the game might require the player to check the floor or interact with it. However, the user's previous actions were moving directions, and the last message says "There is a passkey on the floor." So the correct command here is to pick it up. But in some text games, you have to use a specific command like 'take passkey' or 'get passkey'. However, the user's previous commands were all 'go directions', so maybe the game expects 'take passkey' or 'pick up passkey'. But the user's instruction says to only output the action, like "go north". So the correct action here is to pick up the passkey. Let me check the previous steps again. The user's last message was in the cookery, and the passkey is on the floor. So the next step is to pick it up. The answer should be 'take passkey' or 'pick up passkey'. But the user's previous actions were all 'go directions', so maybe the game expects 'take passkey' as the command. However, the user's instruction says to only output the action, so the correct answer is 'take passkey' or 'pick up passkey'. But in the game's context, maybe the correct command is 'take passkey'. Alternatively, maybe the game requires the player to just pick it up by moving, but since it's on the floor, the command is 'take passkey'. So the next action is to take the passkey.
