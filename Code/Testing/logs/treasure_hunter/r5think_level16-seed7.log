Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First step, go to the south. Okay, and then, go to the east. If you can finish that, make an effort to take a trip north. And then, try to venture north. Once you finish that, make an attempt to head east. Following that, recover the latchkey from the pan in the cookhouse. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Recreation Zone =-
You've entered a recreation zone.



There is an open passageway leading north. There is an open hatch leading south.

-= Laundry Place =-
You have walked into a laundry place. Not the laundry place you'd expect. No, this is a laundry place. You begin looking for stuff.

You can see an opened cabinet, which looks ordinary, in the corner. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You make out a table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

There is an open portal leading east. There is an open hatch leading north.

-= Cubicle =-
I am sorry to announce that you are now in the cubicle.

You see a coffer. You make out an opened trunk. The trunk is empty! What a waste of a day!

There is an open gateway leading south. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in a TextWorld game and has been moving through different rooms: Recreation Zone, Laundry Place, Bedroom, Bathroom, and now Cubicle. The original goal was to go south, then east, north, east again, and then recover the latchkey from the pan in the cookhouse.

So far, the user has followed the initial directions: went south from Recreation Zone to Laundry Place, then east to Bedroom, north to Bathroom, and then north again to Cubicle. Now, in the Cubicle, they need to figure out the next step. The current room has a coffer and an opened trunk, both empty. The directions are south and east. The user is supposed to eventually get to the cookhouse to retrieve the latchkey.

The user is asking if they're on the right track and if they're close to the goal. From the path taken, they've been moving north and east, but the cookhouse hasn't been reached yet. The next logical step might be to check the east direction from the Cubicle, as there's an open gateway leading east. The trunk is empty, but maybe there's something else in the east direction. Alternatively, maybe they need to go south from the Cubicle back to the Bathroom and then find another path. However, the user's previous moves have been to go north and east, so following that pattern, going east from Cubicle makes sense. The next action should be to go east.
</think>go east

-= Cookhouse =-
Wow! You're in a cookhouse. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You make out a pan. The pan is ordinary. On the pan you see a latchkey. You scan the room, seeing a bowl. However, the bowl, like an empty bowl, has nothing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the bowl.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.
