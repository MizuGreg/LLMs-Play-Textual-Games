Welcome to TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First, it would be a great idea if you could venture south. And then, go east. And then, travel north. With that over with, make an effort to go north. With that done, pick-up the passkey from the floor of the cookery. Got that? Good!

-= Spare Room =-
If you're wondering why everything seems so standard all of a sudden, it's because you've just shown up in the spare room.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

There is a keycard on the floor.
