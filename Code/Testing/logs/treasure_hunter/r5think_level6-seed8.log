Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an fast paced round of TextWorld? You do! Here is your task for today. Your first objective is to make an effort to move east. Okay, and then, go to the east. Then, recover the shoe from the floor of the attic. Alright, thanks!

-= Study =-
Well, here we are in a study.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Cubicle =-
You are in a cubicle. An ordinary one. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

Well, here we are in the attic.



There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

There is a latchkey and a shoe on the floor.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user has been moving through different rooms in the game. The goal is to recover the shoe from the attic. So far, they've gone from the study, through the cubicle, recreation zone, back to the cubicle, and now they're in the attic. The attic has a latchkey and a shoe on the floor.

The next step would be to pick up the shoe. But the game might require specific commands. Since the user is in the attic, they need to take the shoe. The previous actions were moving directions, so the next logical command is to take the shoe. But I need to check if the game allows that. The description mentions the shoe is on the floor, so using 'take shoe' should work. Alternatively, maybe 'get shoe' is the correct command. But in TextWorld, common commands are 'take' or 'get'. Let me confirm. The user has been using 'go' commands, so maybe 'take shoe' is the right action here. The answer should be 'take shoe'.
