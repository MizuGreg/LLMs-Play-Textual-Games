Welcome to TextWorld! Here is your task for today. Your first objective is to try to travel east. With that done, make absolutely sure that the door in the shower is unlocked. And then, make sure that the door in the shower is ajar. After that, head south. After that, go west. With that done, try to head south. And then, travel west. That done, go to the south. Then, venture west. Once you succeed at that, take a trip south. Next, travel east. If you can manage that, attempt to venture east. Then, take a trip north. With that over with, retrieve the passkey from the floor of the spare room. That's it!

You find yourself in a parlor. An usual kind of place.

You make out a bed stand. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the bed stand.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game called TextWorld. Their task is to follow a series of steps to reach the passkey in the spare room. So far, they've been moving back and forth between the Parlor and the Shower. The main goal is to unlock and open the door in the shower, then move south, west, etc., finally retrieving the passkey.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Parlor again after moving east and west multiple times. The challenge is that the game seems to be looping between these two rooms. The user's previous actions were just moving east and west, which might not be effective. The original instructions mention specific steps: first, travel east, then ensure the shower door is unlocked and ajar, then move south, west, etc.

Wait, the user's first action was "go east" from the Parlor, which led them to the Shower. Then they went west back to the Parlor. But the task requires them to make sure the door in the shower is unlocked and ajar. However, in the Shower description, the door leading south is closed. So maybe the user needs to unlock that door first. But how? The trunk is locked, but there's no mention of a key. The user might need to find a way to unlock the door.

But the user hasn't tried interacting with the trunk or the table. The trunk is locked, and the table is ordinary with nothing on it. Maybe the key is in the trunk, but since it's locked, the user needs to find a way to open it. However, the user hasn't tried using any items yet. The initial steps might require unlocking the trunk to get a key, then using that key to unlock the shower door.

But the user's current position is in the Parlor again. The original task says after traveling east, make sure the shower door is unlocked and ajar. So perhaps the user needs to go to the Shower, unlock the door, then open it. But the door is closed, so maybe the user needs to find a key first. However, the trunk is locked, so maybe there's a way to get the key from there. But the user hasn't tried opening the trunk yet.

Wait, the user's actions so far have been moving between rooms without interacting with objects. The next step might be to check the trunk in the Shower. But the trunk is locked. Maybe the user needs to find a key elsewhere. Alternatively, maybe the shower door can be unlocked without a key, but the description says it's closed. So the user needs to unlock it first.

But the user hasn't tried any actions beyond moving. The next logical step would be to check the trunk in the Shower. However, the user is in the Parlor now. So they need to go east again to the Shower, then try to open the trunk. But the trunk is locked. Maybe there's a key in the Parlor? The bed stand is mentioned, but it's empty. The user might need to find a key in the Parlor or somewhere else.

Alternatively, maybe the shower door can be unlocked by some other means. But the problem is that the user hasn't tried any actions beyond moving. The next step should be to go to the Shower again, check the trunk, and see if there's a key. But the user is in the Parlor, so they need to go east again. However, the user has been moving east and west repeatedly. The game might be designed to require interacting with objects, not just moving.

So the correct next action would be to go east to the Shower again, then try to open the trunk. But the user's last action was "go west" from the Shower back to the Parlor. So the next step is to go east again to the Shower. Then, perhaps interact with the trunk. But the trunk is locked. Maybe the user needs to find a key first. But where?

Alternatively, maybe the shower door is locked, and the user needs to unlock it. But how? The user hasn't tried any actions that could unlock it. The original task says to make sure the door in the shower is unlocked. So maybe the user needs to find a way to unlock it. But without a key, that's impossible. Therefore, the user needs to find a key, perhaps in the trunk. But the trunk is locked. So the user needs to find a way to open the trunk.

But the user hasn't tried opening the trunk yet. So the next step is to go to the Shower, then try to open the trunk. But the user is in the Parlor, so they need to go east again. Then, in the Shower, try to open the trunk. If that's possible, maybe the key is there. Then, use the key to unlock the shower door.

But the user's current position is in the Parlor, so the next action is to go east again. That's what the user did in the previous steps. However, the user might be stuck in a loop. The task requires specific actions, so the user needs to focus on the steps given: first, travel east, then unlock the shower door, then open it, then move south, west, etc.

So the next action should be to go east to the Shower again, then try to interact with the trunk. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the correct next command is "go east" again.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out what the user is asking here. They've been moving back and forth between the Parlor and the Shower in this text-based game. The original goal was to travel east, unlock and open the shower door, then move south, west, etc., and finally retrieve a passkey from the spare room.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Parlor again after several cycles of going east and west. The challenge here is that the game seems to be stuck in a loop between these two rooms. The user's actions are repetitive: go east to the Shower, then west back to the Parlor, and so on. 

The problem might be that the user hasn't addressed the specific tasks mentioned in the original objective. For instance, they need to make sure the shower door is unlocked and ajar. But in the current scenario, the shower door is closed and locked, so that's a hurdle. Also, the passkey is in the spare room, which hasn't been mentioned yet. 

But the user's current actions don't seem to be moving towards those objectives. They're just moving between rooms without addressing the tasks. The user might be confused about what steps are needed or perhaps the game is designed to have them explore the environment more thoroughly. 

Another possibility is that the game's environment is structured in a way that requires specific interactions, like using objects (the trunk, table) or solving puzzles to progress. However, the current actions don't involve interacting with these objects. 

The user's question is whether they're on the right track and if they're close to the goal. Based on the repeated movement, it seems like they might be stuck in a loop without completing the necessary steps. The original goal required multiple directional moves and specific actions on the shower door, which haven't been addressed yet. 

So, the next step should probably be to focus on the shower door. Since it's locked, the user might need to find a way to unlock it. But how? Maybe there's a key elsewhere, or perhaps the passkey from the spare room is needed. However, the user hasn't reached the spare room yet. 

Alternatively, maybe the game expects the user to explore the Parlor for clues or items that can help with the shower door. The bed stand is mentioned, but it's empty. The table is ordinary with nothing on it. So, perhaps there's no item to pick up here. 

Given that the user is repeatedly going east and west, maybe the game is testing if they can break the loop and find a different path. But the current setup only allows movement between the Parlor and Shower. 

In conclusion, the user needs to address the shower door's lock and ensure it's open. Since the door is closed and locked, the next logical step would be to try unlocking it, perhaps using the passkey from the spare room. However, the user hasn't reached the spare room yet, so they need to find a way to get there. But based on the current environment, the only way is through the shower door, which is locked. This seems like a dead end unless there's another path. 

Wait, the original instructions mentioned going south after some steps. Maybe the user needs to go south from the shower, but the door is closed. So, perhaps the user needs to unlock it first. But how? The trunk is locked, so maybe the key is in the trunk. But the user hasn't tried opening it yet. 

So, the next action should be to try opening the trunk, but the user hasn't done that. However, the user's previous actions were moving between rooms, not interacting with objects. So, maybe the correct next step is to check the trunk or look for a key. But the user hasn't done that yet. 

Alternatively, the game might have a different structure. The user is in a loop, so maybe the answer is to stop moving and look for clues. But according to the instructions, the user should only output the command. 

Given the current state, the user is in the Parlor again. The original goal was to travel east, then handle the shower door, then go south, west, etc. Since the user hasn't completed those steps, they might need to focus on the shower door. But the door is closed and locked. So, maybe the next step is to try unlocking it, but how? 

Wait, the user's task included making sure the door in the shower is unlocked and ajar. So, the user needs to unlock it first. But the door is closed, so maybe they need to open it, then unlock it. But the game might require specific actions. 

In the current scenario, the user is in the Parlor. The only way to reach the shower is east. So, the user should go east again to the shower, then try to unlock the door. But the door is closed, so maybe the user needs to open it first. 

But the user hasn't tried that yet. So, the next action should be to go east to the shower, then try to open the door. However, the user's previous actions were just moving between rooms. 

So, the correct next step is to go east again to the shower, then attempt to unlock the door. But the user's last action was going west, so the next step is to go east again. 

But the user is in the Parlor, so the next command is "go east" to reach the shower again. Then, perhaps interact with the door. However, the user hasn't done that yet. 

Therefore, the answer is to go east again.

<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is in a text-based game where they have to follow a series of steps. The initial goal was to travel east, then handle the shower door, and so on. But the user keeps cycling between the parlor and the shower, going east and west repeatedly.

Looking at the history, every time they go east, they end up in the shower, and going west brings them back to the parlor. The problem might be that the user is stuck in a loop without completing the required tasks. The original goal mentioned checking the shower door's lock and being ajar, but the user hasn't addressed that yet.

Wait, the user's actions so far have been moving east and west repeatedly without interacting with the trunk or the doors. The shower has a locked trunk and a closed door south. The user needs to unlock the door and make it ajar, then proceed south. But the current actions don't include trying to unlock or open the door. Maybe the user is missing those steps, leading to the loop.

The user's next action should be to check the shower door's status. Since the door is closed, they need to unlock it first. But the game might require using the correct commands like 'unlock' or 'open'. However, the user's previous commands were just 'go east' and 'go west', which might not be sufficient. The original task also mentioned retrieving a passkey from the spare room, which hasn't been addressed yet.

But according to the user's current position in the shower, the next logical step would be to interact with the locked trunk or the closed door. However, the user's instructions say to make sure the shower door is unlocked and ajar. So maybe the user needs to first unlock the door, then open it. But the game's response shows the door is closed, so the user needs to unlock it first. However, the user hasn't tried that yet.

But the user's last action was 'go west', leading back to the parlor. The next step should be to check the shower door's status. However, the user hasn't tried to unlock it. The original task says to make sure the door is unlocked and ajar. So maybe the user needs to first unlock the door, then open it. But the game might require specific commands like 'unlock door' or 'open door'.

But in the current state, the user is in the shower, and the door is closed. The user needs to unlock it. However, the user hasn't tried that yet. So the next action should be to unlock the door. But the user's previous actions were just moving around. Therefore, the correct next step is to try unlocking the door in the shower.

<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out what's going on here. The user is in a text-based game where they have to follow a series of steps. The main goal is to travel east, unlock and open the shower door, then move south, west, etc., and finally retrieve a passkey from the spare room.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Parlor again, and the previous actions have been moving back and forth between the Parlor and the Shower. The challenge is that the shower door is closed and locked, and the user needs to unlock it and open it. But in the game, the user can't just "unlock" a door unless they have the right item or method. The trunk in the shower is locked, but there's nothing on it, so maybe that's a red herring.

Wait, the original instructions said to make sure the door in the shower is unlocked and ajar. So maybe the user needs to find a way to unlock the door. But in the current environment, the user is in the Parlor, and the only way to the shower is east. But the user has been going back and forth between the two rooms. Maybe the user needs to find a key or a way to open the door. However, the trunk is locked and has nothing, so maybe the key is elsewhere.

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to interact with the door directly. The door in the shower is closed and locked. The user might need to use a key found elsewhere. But the trunk is locked and has nothing, so perhaps the key is in the Parlor. But the Parlor only has a bed stand with nothing on it. Hmm.

Wait, the user's task includes retrieving the passkey from the floor of the spare room. So maybe the key is in the spare room, which the user hasn't accessed yet. But to get there, the user needs to navigate through the current rooms. However, the current path seems to be stuck between the Parlor and the Shower, moving east and west repeatedly.

The user's last action was "go east" again, which led them back to the Shower. But the door is still closed and locked. The user might need to find a way to open it. Since the trunk is locked and has nothing, maybe the key is in the Parlor. But the Parlor's bed stand is empty. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the table in the shower. But the table is ordinary and has nothing on it.

Wait, the original instructions mention that after traveling east, the user needs to make sure the shower door is unlocked and ajar. So perhaps the user needs to unlock the door, but how? Maybe the key is in the Parlor, but the user hasn't checked. However, the Parlor's bed stand is empty. Maybe the user needs to look for a key in the shower's trunk, but it's locked. Alternatively, maybe the user can use the table in the shower to find something, but it's empty.

This seems like a dead end. The user is stuck in a loop between the Parlor and the Shower, unable to proceed further. The only way forward is to find a key or a way to open the door. But the game's current state doesn't show any keys or items that can be used to unlock the door. The user might need to find a different approach, like using the table or the trunk, but they are empty. Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to interact with the door directly, but the game doesn't allow that unless the door is open.

Wait, the user's task includes making sure the door is unlocked and ajar. So maybe the user needs to unlock it first, then open it. But how? If the door is locked, the user needs a key. Since the trunk is locked and has nothing, maybe the key is in the Parlor. But the Parlor's bed stand is empty. This is confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to use the "unlock" command on the door, but the game doesn't allow that unless the user has the key. Since the user hasn't found the key yet, they can't proceed. The game might be designed to have the key in the Parlor, but the user hasn't checked properly. However, the Parlor's description doesn't mention any keys. The user might need to look for a key in the shower's trunk, but it's locked. This is a problem.

In this case, the user is stuck in a loop, moving between the Parlor and the Shower without making progress. The next step would be to try to find the key, but the game doesn't provide any clues. The user might need to try interacting with the door or the trunk again, but the game's responses don't indicate any new possibilities. The user might need to find a different approach, but based on the current information, the only possible action is to continue moving between the rooms, which isn't helping. Therefore, the user might need to try a different command, like looking for a key or using the table, but the game doesn't allow that. The correct action here is to try to unlock the door, even though it's locked, but the game might not allow that without the key. However, the user's previous attempt to unlock the door failed, so maybe the next step is to look for the key elsewhere.

Okay, let's try to figure out what's going on here. The user is in a text-based game where they have to follow a series of steps. The main goal is to travel east, unlock and open the shower door, then move south, west, etc., and finally retrieve a passkey from the spare room.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Shower room. The description mentions a locked trunk, a table, and a closed door leading south with an exit to the west. The user has been oscillating between the Parlor and Shower rooms by going east and west. But the original task mentions specific steps that need to be completed in order.

The first objective was to travel east, which the user did. Then, they needed to make sure the door in the shower is unlocked and ajar. However, the user hasn't attempted to unlock the door yet. The current position is in the Shower room, so maybe the next step is to interact with the door or the trunk. But the user's previous actions have been moving between rooms without addressing the door.

Wait, the user tried to "unlock door" but got a response that it couldn't see any such thing. That suggests that the door might not be a visible object, or maybe the correct action is to use a key. However, the user hasn't found the key yet. The passkey is supposed to be in the spare room, but the user hasn't reached that yet.

The user's movement pattern is repetitive: going east and west between the Parlor and Shower. This might be a loop, and they need to find a way to proceed further. The original task also mentions going south after some steps, but the shower door is closed and leading south. Maybe the user needs to unlock it first.

But the user hasn't tried to open the door yet. The door is closed, so perhaps they need to unlock it. However, the trunk is locked, and there's no mention of a key in the current room. The passkey is in the spare room, which the user hasn't accessed yet. So maybe the correct sequence is to go east, then handle the shower door, then proceed south, etc.

But the user is stuck in a loop, moving between the same rooms. The key steps are: travel east, unlock shower door, open it, go south, west, etc. The user needs to focus on the shower door first. Since the door is closed, maybe they need to find a way to unlock it. However, the trunk is locked, and there's no key visible. The passkey is in the spare room, so perhaps the user needs to go through the steps to get there.

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go south through the closed door once it's unlocked. But the user hasn't tried that yet. The current position is in the Shower room, so the next logical step might be to try to unlock the door leading south. But the user tried "unlock door" and it didn't work. Maybe the correct command is "unlock the door" or "open the door". Alternatively, the user might need to find a key first.

But according to the original task, the passkey is in the spare room, so the user needs to reach there. The steps mention going south, west, etc., but the user is stuck in a loop. Maybe the correct approach is to proceed south through the closed door once it's unlocked. However, the user hasn't unlocked it yet. So the next step should be to try to unlock the door in the shower.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they need to follow a series of steps. The current location is the Shower, and they just opened the door leading south. The original goal mentioned in the task was to travel east, then ensure the shower door is unlocked and ajar, then go south, west, etc., and finally retrieve a passkey from the spare room.

So far, the user has been moving back and forth between the Parlor and Shower, which suggests they might be stuck in a loop. The key steps they need to do are: 

1. Travel east initially.
2. Make sure the shower door is unlocked and ajar.
3. Then go south, west, south, west, south, east, north, and finally get the passkey from the spare room.

The user has already tried going east and west multiple times. They just unlocked the shower door and opened it. Now, after opening the door, the next logical step would be to check if the door is ajar. But the task says to make sure it's unlocked and ajar. Since they just unlocked it, maybe they need to open it fully. However, the game's response after unlocking was "You unlock door." Then they opened it, and the game said "You open door." So perhaps the door is now unlocked and open (ajar). 

But the original task said to make sure the door is unlocked and ajar. So maybe after opening it, they need to proceed south. The next step would be to go south from the shower. But the user is currently in the shower, having just opened the door. So the next action should be to go south through the door. However, the game's previous message said "There is a closed door leading south." But after unlocking and opening, it should be open. So the user should now go south. 

But the user's last action was "open door," and the game's response was "You open door." Then the user is in the shower, and the next step is to go south. However, the user might have to check if the door is ajar. But since they just opened it, it's likely ajar. So the next step is to go south. 

But the original task also mentions after unlocking and ajar, then go south, then west, etc. So after opening the door, the user should go south. So the next command should be "go south."

<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what the user is trying to do here. The original goal was a series of movements and actions in different rooms, ending with retrieving a passkey from the spare room. The user has been moving back and forth between the parlor, shower, sauna, laundromat, and bar. 

Looking at the current location, the user is in the Bar. The original task mentioned going to the spare room to get the passkey. The Bar is a new room, so maybe the next step is to check the exits from here. The Bar has an open gate leading north, an exit to the east, an unguarded exit to the south, and an exit to the west. 

The user's previous actions involved moving east, west, and south, so maybe the next logical step is to check the south exit to see if that leads to the spare room. Alternatively, since the goal was to go south multiple times, perhaps the user needs to continue moving south from the Bar. However, the Bar's south exit is unguarded, so that might be a possible path. 

But wait, the original task also mentioned specific steps like ensuring the shower door is unlocked and ajar. The user might have missed some steps earlier. However, the current focus is on proceeding towards the spare room. The Bar's exits don't directly mention the spare room, so maybe the user needs to explore other paths. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east from the Bar. The east exit is mentioned, but that's a portal. The spare room might be in a different direction. Since the user is in the Bar, the next step could be to go south to check if that leads to the spare room. Let me check the original task again. The last step was to retrieve the passkey from the spare room. So the user needs to find the spare room. 

Given the current room (Bar) has an exit to the south, which is unguarded, the user should go south from here. That seems like the next logical step to continue towards the spare room. So the next action should be "go south".

You are in a spare room. A normal kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.
