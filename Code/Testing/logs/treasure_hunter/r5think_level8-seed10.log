I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, head east. Then, make an effort to travel south. After that, attempt to go west. And then, retrieve the carrot from the floor of the chamber. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Spare Room =-
You find yourself in a spare room. A typical one.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

-= Attic =-
You have entered an attic. Not the attic you'd expect. No, this is an attic. The room is well lit.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

There is a latchkey on the floor.

-= Bedchamber =-
Well, here we are in the bedchamber.



There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me figure out what to do next. The user is in the Bedchamber, which is room 3. The previous steps were going east from the Spare Room to the Attic, then south to the Bedchamber. The goal is to retrieve the carrot from the floor of the chamber and win.

Looking at the current room description: the Bedchamber has an unblocked exit to the north and west. The user needs to find the carrot. But the current room's description doesn't mention a carrot. Wait, maybe the carrot is in a different room. The original task said to go east, then south, then west, then get the carrot. So far, they've done east, south. Next would be west. But the Bedchamber has a west exit. So maybe going west from here would lead to the room with the carrot?

But the user's next action should be to go west. However, the user is asking if they're making the right actions and if they're close. The user might be confused because the carrot isn't in the current room. But according to the task, after going west, they should retrieve the carrot. So the next step is to go west from the Bedchamber. Then, in the next room, there might be the carrot on the floor. So the correct next action is to go west.
</think>go west

-= Chamber =-
Okay, so you're in a chamber, cool, but is it usual? You better believe it is. You begin looking for stuff.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a carrot on the floor.
