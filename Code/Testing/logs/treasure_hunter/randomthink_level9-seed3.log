Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, travel north. With that accomplished, attempt to venture north. And then, make an attempt to go east. And then, head east. Then, pick up the bug from the floor of the kitchenette. Alright, thanks!

Well, here we are in a laundromat.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Kitchenette =-
You've entered a kitchenette. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.



There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

There is a bug on the floor.


>                                                                                                                                -= Kitchenette =-0/5
SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user has been moving through different rooms in the laundromat. They started by going north, then north again, then east, east, and now they're in the Kitchenette. The goal was to pick up the bug from the floor of the kitchenette.

So far, the user has reached the Kitchenette, and the bug is on the floor here. The next logical step would be to pick up the bug. But the prompt says to only output the action, like "pick up bug" or something similar. The previous actions were all "go north" or "go east", so the next action should be to pick up the bug. The user is close to the goal, so the answer should be to pick up the bug.
</think>pick up bug
