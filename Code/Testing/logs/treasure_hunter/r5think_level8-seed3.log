Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First, it would be fantastic if you could travel north. Next, venture east. With that over with, travel east. With that accomplished, pick-up the bug from the floor of the kitchenette. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Shower =-
I am sorry to announce that you are now in the shower.



There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

You arrive in a basement. A normal one.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a broom on the floor.

-= Kitchenette =-
You've entered a kitchenette. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.



There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

There is a bug on the floor.


>                                                                                                                                -= Kitchenette =-0/4
SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me figure out what to do next. The user is in the Kitchenette, and there's a bug on the floor. The original goal was to pick up the bug from the kitchenette floor after traveling north, east, east. So far, they've gone north to the Shower, then east to the Basement, then east to the Bedroom, then east again to the Kitchenette. The next step is to pick up the bug.

The current room is the Kitchenette. The prompt mentions there's a bug on the floor. So the next action should be to pick up the bug. But the user's last action was going east to the Kitchenette. Now, they need to pick up the bug. The command should be "take bug" or "pick up bug". But in TextWorld, the correct command might be "take bug" or "get bug". Let me check the previous interactions. The user was told to "pick-up the bug from the floor of the kitchenette". So the correct command is "take bug" or "pick up bug". The user needs to do that now. So the next action is to take the bug.
</think>take bug
