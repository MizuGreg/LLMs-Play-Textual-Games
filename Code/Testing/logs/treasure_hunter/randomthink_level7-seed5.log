I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is how to play! First, it would be fantastic if you could attempt to move east. And then, head south. After that, try to go to the east. If you can finish that, pick-up the fondue from the floor of the cookhouse. Alright, thanks!

-= Kitchenette =-
You arrive in a kitchenette. An ordinary kind of place. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

-= Study =-
You've just sauntered into a study.



There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

There is a disk on the floor.

-= Chamber =-
You're now in the chamber. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.

-= Cookhouse =-
You have fallen into the most typical of all possible cookhouses.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

There is a fondue on the floor.
