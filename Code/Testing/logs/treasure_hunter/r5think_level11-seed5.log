Welcome to another fast paced session of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First thing I need you to do is to make an effort to go south. Then, pick-up the chocolate bar from the floor of the chamber. That's it!

-= Kitchenette =-
I just think it's great that you've just entered a kitchenette.

You can see a freezer.

There is an open hatch leading north. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Chamber =-
You make another one of your grand eccentric entrances into a chamber.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the north.

There is a chocolate bar on the floor.

-= Cookhouse =-
Ah, the cookhouse. This is some kind of cookhouse, really great normal vibes in this place, a wonderful normal atmosphere. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.



There is an unguarded exit to the east. There is an unblocked exit to the north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they need to pick up a chocolate bar and go south. They've been trying but keep getting stuck.

First, they started by going south from the kitchenette, which led them to the chamber. They picked up the chocolate bar, but the game didn't accept it. Then they tried going south again, but couldn't. Then they went east to the cookhouse, west back to the chamber, and tried picking up the chocolate bar again, which failed. Now they're at the chamber again, and the system is asking if they're on the right track.

So, the problem is that the chocolate bar is in the chamber, and they need to pick it up. But the previous attempt to pick it up was rejected. Maybe the correct verb is "take" instead of "pick-up"? Or maybe they need to use a different command. But the game's feedback says "That's not a verb I recognise," so "pick-up" might not be the right command. The correct verb might be "take" or "get".

But the user's last action was "pick-up chocolate bar", which was rejected. Then they tried "go south" again, which wasn't possible. Then they went east to cookhouse, west back to chamber. Now they're back in the chamber with the chocolate bar. The next step should be to pick it up correctly. Since the game didn't accept "pick-up", maybe the correct command is "take chocolate bar". Let me check the previous messages. The user tried "pick-up" and it failed. So the correct verb is probably "take".

So the next action should be "take chocolate bar". But the user is supposed to only output the action. So the answer is "take chocolate bar".
</think>take chocolate bar
