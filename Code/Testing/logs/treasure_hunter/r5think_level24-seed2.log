Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First step, travel south. Once you manage that, try to take a trip west. If you can manage that, try to take a trip south. And then, try to head west. Then, head south. And then, head east. Then, make an attempt to go to the east. And then, attempt to head north. With that done, pick up the passkey from the floor of the spare room. Got that? Good!

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is in a text-based game called TextWorld, and their task is to navigate through different rooms and eventually pick up the passkey from the spare room. So far, they've moved through several locations: Laundromat, Bar, Bedchamber, Workshop, Scullery, Kitchen, and back to Bedchamber and Workshop. 

The current room is the Workshop, and the user is at step 8. The goal is to reach the spare room and pick up the passkey. The user's previous actions have been moving in different directions, but they might be going in circles. Let me check the path they've taken.

Starting from Laundromat, they went south to Bar, then west to Bedchamber, south to Workshop, west to Scullery, north to Kitchen, east back to Bedchamber, south to Workshop again. So they're oscillating between Workshop and Bedchamber and Scullery. Maybe they need to find a different path.

Looking at the current room (Workshop), the exits are east, north, and south. The user previously tried going west, but that led to Scullery. Maybe they need to go north from Workshop? The Workshop's description says there's an exit to the north. If they go north from Workshop, they might reach a different room. But the user's last move was south to Workshop again. 

Wait, the user's task was to go south, then west, then south, then west, then south, then east, then east again, then north. But they might have missed some steps. Alternatively, maybe they need to find the spare room. The passkey is in the spare room, so they need to find that. 

Looking at the rooms they've visited: Laundromat, Bar, Bedchamber, Workshop, Scullery, Kitchen. The spare room hasn't been mentioned yet. Maybe the spare room is connected to one of these. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east from the Workshop. The Workshop has an unblocked exit to the east. Let me check the previous steps. 

When they were in the Workshop (step 8), the exits are east, north, and south. If they go east from Workshop, they might reach a new room. But in the previous steps, when they were in the Workshop, they went south to the Workshop again. Wait, maybe the user needs to go east from the Workshop. Let me think: the user's last action was going south to Workshop again. So from Workshop, they can go east, north, or south. If they go east, maybe that's the way to the spare room. 

Alternatively, maybe the spare room is in the Kitchen or Scullery. But the user hasn't found the passkey yet. The task says to pick up the passkey from the floor of the spare room. So the user needs to find the spare room. 

Looking back at the rooms, the Scullery had a freezer. The Kitchen had a table. The Bedchamber has a bed and couch. The Workshop has a cabinet and mantelpiece. The Bar has a recliner. The Laundromat has a portal east and gate south. 

Maybe the spare room is connected to the Scullery or the Kitchen. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west from the Workshop. But the Workshop's west exit is unblocked. Wait, in the Workshop description, it says "You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked." So going west from Workshop would lead to Scullery again. 

Hmm. The user is stuck in a loop between Workshop, Scullery, and Bedchamber. Maybe they need to go north from the Workshop. The Workshop has an exit to the north. Let me check the previous steps. When the user was in the Workshop (step 8), they could go north. If they go north, maybe they reach a new room. But in the previous steps, when they were in the Workshop, they went south to the Workshop again. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east from the Workshop. Let me think: the user's task was to go south, then west, then south, then west, then south, then east, then east again, then north. So after going east from the Kitchen (step 6), they went back to Bedchamber (step 7), then south to Workshop (step 8). Now, from Workshop, they need to go east, then maybe north? 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to find the spare room through another path. Since the passkey is in the spare room, perhaps the user needs to find that room. But the current rooms don't mention it. Maybe the spare room is the Kitchen? Or the Scullery? 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west from the Workshop again, but that's Scullery. Then from Scullery, go north to Kitchen. Then from Kitchen, go east to Bedchamber again. But that's not helpful. 

Wait, the user's task was to go south, then west, then south, then west, then south, then east, then east again, then north. So after going east from the Kitchen (step 6), they went back to Bedchamber (step 7), then south to Workshop (step 8). Now, from Workshop, they need to go east, then north? 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go north from Workshop. Let me check the Workshop's exits again. The Workshop has an exit to the north. If they go north from Workshop, they might reach a new room. But the user hasn't been there yet. 

So, the next action should be to go north from the Workshop. That would be the next step. But the user's previous steps were going south, so maybe that's the right direction. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east from Workshop. 

But the user's task was to go east after going south, then east again, then north. So maybe the user needs to go east from Workshop. Let me check the current room. The Workshop has an unblocked exit to the east. So the next action would be to go east. 

But the user is at step 8, and the next action is to go east from Workshop. That would take them to a new room. Let me think: if they go east from Workshop, where would they be? The previous steps when they were in the Workshop, they went south to Workshop again. So maybe going east from Workshop leads to a new room. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go north from Workshop. But the user's task was to go north after the previous steps. 

I think the correct next step is to go east from the Workshop. So the answer would be "go east".
</think>go east

-= Spare Room =-
I never took you for the sort of person who would show up in a spare room, but I guess I was wrong.



There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

There is a passkey on the floor.
