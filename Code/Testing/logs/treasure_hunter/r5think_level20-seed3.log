Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to make an effort to go west. Then, take a trip north. After that, head west. Okay, and then, try to head south. After that, pick-up the teaspoon from the floor of the cookhouse. And if you do that, you're the winner!

Okay, let me figure out what to do next. The user mentioned a series of directions: go west, then north, then west again, then south. After that, pick up the teaspoon from the cookhouse.

So far, the user started in the Cubicle, went west to the Vault, then north to the Workshop. The next step according to the instructions is to go west again. The Workshop has an open door leading west, so that's possible. Let me check the current location. The user is in the Workshop, and the available exits are south and west. So going west would be the next move. Then, after that, they need to go south. But first, the immediate next action is west. So the correct command here is "go west".

-= Sauna =-
You find yourself in a sauna.



There is a closed portal leading west. There is an open door leading east. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

-= Cookhouse =-
You arrive in a standard kind of place. That is to say, you're in a cookhouse.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a teaspoon on the floor.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game and has followed some directions. The goal was to pick up the teaspoon from the cookhouse. Let me recap the steps taken so far.

Starting in the Cubicle, they went west to the Vault, then north to the Workshop, west again to the Sauna, then south to the Cookhouse. Now, in the Cookhouse, there's a teaspoon on the floor. The prompt says "pick-up the teaspoon from the floor of the cookhouse. And if you do that, you're the winner!" So the next step should be to pick up the teaspoon.

But wait, the user's last action was going south to the Cookhouse. The current location is Cookhouse, and the teaspoon is there. The next action should be to pick it up. However, in text adventures, sometimes you need to pick up items using a specific command like "take teaspoon" or "get teaspoon". But the user's previous commands were all "go directions". The initial instructions said to "pick-up the teaspoon", so maybe the correct command here is "take teaspoon" or "get teaspoon". But the user might be expected to use the "take" command. However, the user's previous actions were all "go" commands, so maybe they need to use "take" now. But the user's last input was "go south", and the system response is the Cookhouse description. The user's next action should be to pick up the teaspoon. The correct command would be "take teaspoon" or "get teaspoon". But the user might need to use the exact command. Let me check the previous interactions. The user was told to "pick-up the teaspoon", so the correct command is likely "take teaspoon". However, in some games, you just pick it up by being in the room. But since the user has to input a command, "take teaspoon" is the right action here. So the next command should be "take teaspoon".
