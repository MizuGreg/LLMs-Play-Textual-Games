Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First thing I need you to do is to make an attempt to go north. And then, make an attempt to take a trip north. And then, make an attempt to travel north. Then, travel east. After that, take a trip south. Then, make an effort to go to the east. With that accomplished, make an attempt to go south. If you can get through with that, venture west. If you can finish that, pick-up the worm from the floor of the kitchenette. Alright, thanks!

-= Sauna =-
You have fallen into the most standard of all possible saunas.

You make out a board. The board is ordinary. However, the board, like an empty board, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

You are in a shower. A typical kind of place.

You can see a closed dresser in the room. You can make out a basket. You can see a bench. The bench is ordinary. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a rack. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The rack is typical. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this TextWorld game and has been moving through different rooms: sauna, shower, basement, and now the bedroom. The original goal was to go north, take a trip north, travel north, then east, south, east again, and finally pick up the worm from the kitchenette.

So far, the user has gone north from the sauna, then north again to the shower, then east to the basement, and now east to the bedroom. Wait, no, the basement was after the shower. Let me check the steps again.

Wait, the first move was go north from the sauna to the shower. Then go north again from the shower to the basement. Then go east from the basement to the bedroom. Now, in the bedroom, the user is supposed to go south, then east, then west, and finally pick up the worm.

But the current room is the bedroom. The user's next action should be to go south, as per the original plan. The user mentioned that after going east, they need to make an attempt to go south. So from the bedroom, going south would take them back to the basement. Then from the basement, go east again? Wait, the original plan was after going east, then south, then east again. Hmm.

Wait, the original instructions were: go north, take a trip north, travel north, then travel east. After that, take a trip south. Then make an effort to go to the east. With that accomplished, make an attempt to go south. Then venture west. Then pick up the worm.

So maybe the user is on the right track. From the bedroom, going south would take them back to the basement. Then from the basement, going east would take them to the shower? Wait, no. Let me think about the room connections again.

The basement has exits to north, east, and south. The shower has exits to north, east, and south. The bedroom has exits to east, north, and west. So from the bedroom, going south would take them to the basement. Then from the basement, going east would take them to the shower. Then from the shower, going north would take them back to the sauna? Wait, but the original goal was to get to the kitchenette. Maybe the worm is in the kitchenette, which is part of the sauna? Or perhaps the kitchenette is a different room.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to navigate through the rooms to find the worm. The original plan was to go north, then east, then south, then east, then west, and pick up the worm. So after reaching the bedroom, going south to the basement, then east to the shower, then north to the sauna, then east to the kitchenette? But the sauna's exit is north, and the shower's exit is east. Maybe the kitchenette is connected to the shower or basement.

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go from the bedroom south to the basement, then east to the shower, then north to the sauna, then east to the kitchenette. But the sauna's exit is north, so maybe the kitchenette is connected to the sauna's north exit. But the user hasn't reached that yet.

Alternatively, maybe the worm is in the basement. But the user hasn't picked it up yet. The original goal was to pick up the worm from the floor of the kitchenette. So maybe the kitchenette is a separate room connected to the sauna or shower.

But the user is currently in the bedroom. The next step according to the original plan was to go south from the bedroom. So the user should go south to the basement. Then from the basement, go east to the shower. Then from the shower, go north to the sauna. Then from the sauna, go north again? But the sauna's exit is north. Wait, the sauna's exit is north, but the user is already in the sauna. Maybe the kitchenette is connected to the sauna's north exit. But the user hasn't been there yet.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go from the basement east to the shower, then north to the sauna, then east to the kitchenette. But the sauna's exit is north, so maybe the kitchenette is connected to the sauna's north exit. But the user hasn't been there yet.

So the next action should be to go south from the bedroom to the basement. Then proceed as per the plan. The user is currently in the bedroom, so the next step is to go south. The user's previous action was go east to the bedroom, and now they need to go south.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in this text-based game. The original goal was to go north, then take a trip north, travel north, then east, south, east again, and finally pick up the worm in the kitchenette.

So far, the user has gone north from the sauna to the shower, then north again to the basement, then east to the bedroom. But when they tried to go south from the bedroom, it wasn't possible. Now they're stuck in the bedroom. 

The current room is the bedroom. The possible exits are east (unguarded) and north (unguarded). Since south is blocked, the next logical step would be to try going east again. The user had previously tried going east from the basement to the bedroom, so maybe they need to go north from the bedroom now. Wait, the user's last action was going south, which was blocked. So they need to find another way out. The bedroom has an exit to the north and east. The user might need to go north from the bedroom to proceed further. But the original plan was to go east after some steps. Maybe the user needs to check the exits again. The bedroom's north exit is unguarded, so going north would be the next step. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to move east again, but the user needs to confirm if that's possible. The user's next action should be to go north from the bedroom. Let me check the previous messages. The user tried going south and it was blocked, so they need to try the other exits. The bedroom has an exit to the north and east. The user might need to go north first. So the next command would be "go north".

You find yourself in a canteen. An usual one. You start to take note of what's in the room.



You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in this TextWorld game. Their original goal was to go north, then take a trip north, travel north, then east, south, east again, and finally pick up the worm from the kitchenette. But so far, the user has been moving between the Sauna, Shower, Basement, Bedroom, and Canteen, but hasn't found the kitchenette yet.

Looking at the current room, which is the Bedroom again. The user has been going back and forth between Bedroom and Canteen. The original plan was to go east from the Basement, then travel east again, but maybe they got lost in the loops. The user needs to find the kitchenette where the worm is. 

In the Bedroom, the possible exits are east, north, and west. The user tried going south from the Bedroom but couldn't, so they went north again. Now, maybe they should try going west from the Bedroom to see if that leads them towards the kitchenette. Alternatively, since the Canteen is connected to the Bedroom, maybe there's a path from there. But the user's goal is to get to the kitchenette, so perhaps they need to find a different route. 

Wait, the original instructions mentioned going north, then east, then south, then east again. Maybe the user needs to follow that path again. But in the current state, they are in the Bedroom. Let me check the previous steps. The user went from Sauna to Shower to Basement to Bedroom to Canteen back to Bedroom. Maybe the correct path is to go from the Canteen west to the Bedroom, then try going east from there again. But the user is stuck in a loop. 

Alternatively, maybe the kitchenette is in a different part. The user needs to find the correct path. Since the original plan was to go north, then east, then south, then east again, perhaps after reaching the Canteen, going west to the Bedroom, then trying to go east again from the Bedroom. But the user is stuck in the Bedroom. Maybe they need to go west from the Bedroom to find another exit. Let me check the Bedroom's description again. The Bedroom has exits to east, north, and west. The user tried going south but couldn't. So maybe going west from the Bedroom would lead them to another room. If they go west from the Bedroom, perhaps they can reach the kitchenette. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go north from the Bedroom. But the original goal was to go south after traveling east. Hmm. The user's current position is the Bedroom, and they need to proceed towards the kitchenette. Since the user's last action was going south from the Canteen back to the Bedroom, maybe they should try going west from the Bedroom to find the correct path. Let's say the user goes west from the Bedroom. That would be the next step.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in this TextWorld game. The original goal was to pick up the worm from the kitchenette floor after moving around. So far, they've gone through Sauna, Shower, Basement, Bedroom, Canteen, back to Bedroom, Basement, Playroom. Now they're in the Playroom.

The current room is the Playroom. The description mentions a shelf that's empty and suggests exiting east or south. The user's previous actions have been moving north, south, east, west, etc., but they haven't found the worm yet. The kitchenette hasn't been mentioned in the rooms they've visited so far. The original plan was to go north, then east, then south, then west, and finally pick up the worm in the kitchenette.

Wait, the user's initial instructions were to go north, then take a trip north, travel north, then east, south, east, south, west, and then pick up the worm. But the game's rooms are leading them through different areas. The kitchenette hasn't been reached yet. The current room is Playroom, which is room 9. The user needs to find the kitchenette. Maybe the kitchenette is connected to the Playroom via east or south. The Playroom's exits are east and south. The user tried going south before, but that led back to the Bedroom. Maybe they need to go east from Playroom. Let me check the previous steps.

In the Playroom, the suggested exits are east and south. The user's last action was going north to get here. So, from Playroom, going east might lead to another room. If the kitchenette is connected to the Playroom, then going east could be the next step. Alternatively, maybe the kitchenette is in a different direction. But according to the original plan, after going west, they should pick up the worm. But the user hasn't reached the kitchenette yet. Maybe the kitchenette is in the Playroom's east exit. Let me think. The user's goal is to pick up the worm in the kitchenette. So, they need to find the kitchenette room. Since the Playroom is room 9, and the next step is to go east or south. The user might need to go east from Playroom to reach the kitchenette. Alternatively, maybe the kitchenette is in the south exit from Playroom, but that led to the Bedroom before. But the user hasn't explored that path thoroughly. Alternatively, maybe the kitchenette is in the basement or another room. But the user's path so far hasn't included the kitchenette. So, the next logical step is to try going east from the Playroom to see if that leads to the kitchenette. If that's not possible, then maybe south again. But according to the game's current state, the Playroom's exits are east and south. The user needs to proceed towards the kitchenette. So, the next action should be to go east.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in this TextWorld game. The original goal was to eventually pick up the worm from the kitchenette. So far, they've been moving between rooms like the sauna, shower, basement, bedroom, canteen, playroom, and back again.

Looking at the current room, it's the basement again. The user has been going back and forth between the basement and the bedroom. The exits available here are north and south. The user previously tried going north to the playroom and then east to the canteen, but that led them back. Now, they're in the basement again, and the options are to go east or south.

The user's goal is to reach the kitchenette to pick up the worm. So far, they haven't encountered the kitchenette yet. The path seems to loop between the basement, bedroom, canteen, playroom, and back. Maybe the kitchenette is in a different part of the map that's not been explored yet.

The user's next action should be to continue exploring new areas. Since the basement has an exit to the north (playroom) and south (bedroom), but those have been visited already, perhaps they need to find another path. However, the user might be stuck in a loop. Alternatively, maybe the kitchenette is connected through another exit that hasn't been checked yet.

Wait, in the initial instructions, the user was told to go north, then take a trip north, travel north, then east, south, east, etc. But the game's current state shows that the user is stuck in a loop. Maybe the correct path is to keep moving east from the canteen, but the canteen's exit is west. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go north from the basement again, but that leads to the playroom.

Alternatively, perhaps the user needs to find a different route. Since the user is in the basement, maybe they should try going east again, even though that's been done before. Or maybe there's a hidden path. However, the game's responses indicate that the exits are unblocked but the rooms are empty.

Since the user's goal is to pick up the worm in the kitchenette, they need to find the kitchenette. The path might require going through the playroom, canteen, and then maybe another direction. But the current exits from the basement are north (playroom) and south (bedroom). The user might need to go north again to the playroom, then east to the canteen, then south again to the bedroom, and then west to the basement. This seems like a loop, so maybe the user is missing a different exit.

Alternatively, maybe the user should try going west from the basement, but the basement's west exit isn't mentioned. Wait, in the basement description, the exits are north and south. So the user can't go west from the basement. Therefore, the only options are north or south.

Given that the user is in the basement again, the next logical step would be to go north to the playroom again, but that's already been done. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to find a way to get to the kitchenette through another route. However, the current path doesn't show that. The user might be stuck in a loop and needs to find a different approach. But since the game's responses don't indicate any other exits, the user might have to keep moving between the same rooms.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check the workbench in the basement for the worm. But the workbench is described as empty. So that's not it. The worm is in the kitchenette, which hasn't been reached yet. The user needs to find a way to get to the kitchenette. Maybe the kitchenette is connected to the canteen or the playroom. But the canteen's exit is west, and the playroom's exit is east. Maybe the user needs to go east from the playroom again, but that's already been done.

Hmm, perhaps the user is supposed to go north from the basement to the playroom, then east to the canteen, then south to the bedroom, then west to the basement again. This seems like a loop. Maybe the user is missing a different path. Alternatively, maybe the kitchenette is in the basement, but the workbench is empty. The user might need to check other rooms for the worm.

But according to the original instructions, the user needs to pick up the worm from the kitchenette. So the user needs to reach the kitchenette. The current path doesn't show that. Maybe the user needs to go through the canteen and then another direction. However, the canteen's exit is west. So the user is stuck in a loop between the basement, bedroom, canteen, playroom, and back.

In this case, the next action would be to continue moving north from the basement to the playroom again, even though that's been done before. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go south from the basement to the bedroom again. But that's also been done. The user might be stuck, but the game might have a different path that hasn't been explored yet.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east from the playroom again, but that's already been done. The user is stuck in a loop, so the next action would be to continue moving in the same direction, even if it's repetitive. The user's next action would be to go north again from the basement to the playroom.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in this TextWorld game. The original goal was to go north, take a trip north, travel north, then east, south, east again, and finally pick up the worm from the kitchenette.

So far, the user has moved through Sauna → Shower → Basement → Bedroom → Canteen → Playroom and back. They've been going back and forth between these rooms. The current room is the Playroom, and the possible exits are east and south. The user's last action was going north to the Playroom, and now they need to decide whether to go east or south.

Looking at the previous steps, the user has been moving in a loop between the basement, bedroom, canteen, and playroom. The original goal mentioned venturing west after going south, but the user hasn't found the kitchenette yet. The worm is supposed to be in the kitchenette, which hasn't been mentioned in the current rooms. 

The user's next action should be to try going east from the Playroom, as per the prompt. The instruction says to try going east after the previous steps. So the correct next command is "go east".
</think>go east

-= Canteen =-
You find yourself in a canteen. An usual one. You start to take note of what's in the room.



You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

-= Bedroom =-
You're now in a bedroom. You begin looking for stuff.

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a box. You shudder, but continue examining the room.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the north. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in this TextWorld game. The original goal was to pick up the worm from the kitchenette floor after moving around. So far, the user has been moving between rooms like the sauna, shower, basement, bedroom, canteen, playroom, and back. They've been going north, south, east, west repeatedly, which suggests they're trying to find a path that leads them to the kitchenette.

Looking at the current room, it's the bedroom again. The user is in the bedroom, and the possible exits are east, north, and west. The original goal mentioned the kitchenette, which is probably a specific room that's part of the game's layout. The user hasn't found the worm yet, so they need to reach the kitchenette.

The user's actions so far have been moving between rooms, but they might be stuck in a loop. The current room is the bedroom, and the exits are east, north, and west. The user tried going west earlier, which led back to the basement. Maybe they need to find a different path. The kitchenette is likely connected to another room, maybe the canteen or the playroom. But the user hasn't checked those areas thoroughly.

Alternatively, maybe the worm is in the kitchenette, which is connected to the basement or another room. The user needs to find the correct path to the kitchenette. Since the user has been moving around without finding the worm, they might need to check all possible exits from the current room. The bedroom's exits are east, north, and west. The user tried going west and ended up in the basement again. Maybe going east or north from the bedroom could lead to the kitchenette.

But in the previous steps, when the user was in the playroom, they could go east to the canteen, then south to the bedroom. So perhaps the kitchenette is connected to the canteen or the playroom. Alternatively, maybe the basement has a connection to the kitchenette. However, the user hasn't found the worm yet, so they need to continue exploring.

The user's next action should be to try going east from the bedroom, as that's the next possible exit that hasn't been explored in this context. Alternatively, going north from the bedroom might lead to a different room. But based on the previous steps, the user has been moving back and forth between the basement, bedroom, canteen, and playroom. The kitchenette might be in one of these rooms, but the user hasn't checked thoroughly.

Wait, the original instruction mentioned the kitchenette. The user needs to pick up the worm from the kitchenette's floor. So the kitchenette is a specific room. The user needs to find that room. The current room is the bedroom, so the user needs to find the path to the kitchenette from here. The exits from the bedroom are east, north, and west. The user tried west, which led to the basement. Maybe going north from the bedroom is the way to go. But in the previous steps, going north from the bedroom led to the playroom. The playroom's exit is east to the canteen, then south to the bedroom. So maybe the kitchenette is connected to the canteen or the playroom.

Alternatively, maybe the kitchenette is in the basement. But the basement's description doesn't mention a kitchenette. The user needs to find the correct path. Since the user hasn't found the worm yet, they need to continue exploring. The next step would be to try going east from the bedroom, which is the next possible exit. So the user should go east.
