Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First stop, take a trip west. And then, attempt to travel south. Once you accomplish that, make an attempt to go to the east. And then, retrieve the key from the floor of the dish-pit. Got that? Good!

-= Washroom =-
Guess what, you are in a place we're calling a washroom.



You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game called TextWorld, and they've been moving through different rooms. The original task was to first go west, then south, then east, and finally retrieve the key from the dish-pit. 

So far, the user has gone west from the washroom into the parlor, then south into the lounge. In the lounge, they found a keycard on the floor. Then they went north back to the parlor. Now, the next step would be to go east from the parlor, as per the original instructions. But the user is asking if they're on the right track and if they're close to the goal.

Wait, the key was in the dish-pit, which is mentioned in the initial task. But in the current room (parlor), there's no mention of a dish-pit. The key was found in the lounge. Maybe the keycard is the key they need. But the task says to retrieve the key from the floor of the dish-pit. However, in the lounge, the keycard is on the floor. Maybe the dish-pit is another room, and the user needs to find the key there. But the user has already found the keycard in the lounge. Maybe that's the key they need. 

But the user is at the parlor again after going north. The next step would be to go east from the parlor. The original plan was to go west, south, east, then get the key. But they've already done west, south, and then north back to parlor. So maybe the next step is to go east from the parlor. But the user is asking if they're close. Since they found the key in the lounge, maybe that's the key they need. But the task says to get the key from the dish-pit. Maybe the keycard in the lounge is the key, and the dish-pit is a different location. 

Alternatively, maybe the keycard is in the dish-pit, and the user needs to go to the dish-pit. But the user is currently in the parlor. So the next step would be to go east to the next room, perhaps the dish-pit. But the user's current position is the parlor, which has an exit to the east. So the next action should be to go east. Then, once they reach the dish-pit, they can pick up the key. But in the lounge, they already found the keycard. Maybe the keycard is the key, and the dish-pit is where it was placed. 

But the user's next action should be to go east from the parlor. So the correct command is "go east".

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game and has been moving around different rooms. The original goal was to take a trip west, then go south, then east, and retrieve the key from the dish-pit. Let me track their movements so far.

Starting in the Washroom, they went west to the Parlor. Then they went south to the Lounge, where they found a keycard on the floor. Then they went north back to the Parlor, and then east to the Washroom again. 

Wait, the key was in the Lounge, right? So they found the key there. But the original task mentioned retrieving the key from the floor of the dish-pit. Hmm, maybe the dish-pit is another name for the Lounge or a different location. But in the current setup, they're back in the Washroom. 

The user is now in the Washroom again, and the next step would be to check if they have the key. Since they found the key in the Lounge earlier, maybe they already have it. But the task says to retrieve it from the dish-pit. Maybe the dish-pit is the Lounge? Or perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the room names. 

The user's current location is the Washroom, and the next action would be to go south again, as the Washroom has an unguarded exit to the west and a south entrance. But they need to get the key. Since they already picked up the key in the Lounge, maybe they can now proceed to the next steps. However, the original goal might require them to go east again. But the user is at the Washroom again. 

Wait, the original instructions said: first stop, take a trip west (which they did), then attempt to travel south (they did that, leading to the Lounge), then go east (they did that, back to Parlor), then retrieve the key from the dish-pit (which they did in the Lounge). So maybe they have the key now. The next steps would be to proceed further. But the current position is the Washroom. 

The user is at the Washroom again, and the next move would be to go south again, but the task might be complete. However, the user's goal was to reach the original goal, which might be to get the key. Since they have it, maybe they can proceed. But the game might have more steps. However, the user is being asked if they think they're close to the goal. 

Given that they found the key in the Lounge, which was part of the task, they might be done. But the game might require them to go further. However, the current position is the Washroom, and the next action would be to go south again. But the user is supposed to only output the command. So the next action is to go south again.

-= Dish-Pit =-
Wow! You're in a dish-pit.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unblocked exit to the south. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

There is a key on the floor.
