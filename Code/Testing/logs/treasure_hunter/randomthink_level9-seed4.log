Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, try to move south. And then, go west. Next, head north. That done, make an attempt to go north. With that done, pick-up the knife from the floor of the cookhouse. That's it!

-= Cookery =-
You find yourself in a cookery. A normal one. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.



You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Pantry =-
You are in a pantry. A typical kind of place.



There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

There is a sock on the floor.

-= Parlor =-
Guess what, you are in a place we're calling a parlor. The room is well lit.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

-= Shower =-
This might come as a shock to you, but you've just moved into a shower. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

That's not a verb I recognise.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game where they have to navigate through different rooms and pick up a knife. The current room is the Cookhouse, and they've already picked up the knife. But the system said "That's not a verb I recognise." Wait, maybe the correct command is "take knife" instead of "pick-up knife"? In text adventures, the verbs are usually more standard. Let me check the previous interactions.

Earlier, the user was told to "pick-up the knife from the floor of the cookhouse." But when they tried "pick-up knife," the system rejected it. Maybe the correct command is just "take knife" or "get knife." The game might be expecting a different verb. Also, the user is asking if they're close to the goal. They've picked up the knife, which was the main objective, so maybe they're done. But the system is still prompting for a command. Perhaps the user needs to confirm they have the knife or exit the room. But the last action was picking up the knife, which was the target. Maybe the game is expecting them to go somewhere else, but the original instruction was just to pick up the knife. Hmm. The user might need to check if the knife is picked up correctly. Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "take knife" instead of "pick-up." Let me go with "take knife" as the next action.
