Welcome to TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, you could, like, attempt to go to the south. Then, head west. Then, lift the carrot from the floor of the chamber. That's it!

-= Attic =-
You have entered an attic. Not the attic you'd expect. No, this is an attic. The room is well lit.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

There is a latchkey on the floor.

go south

-= Bedchamber =-
Well, here we are in the bedchamber.



There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go west
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Chamber =-
Okay, so you're in a chamber, cool, but is it usual? You better believe it is. You begin looking for stuff.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a carrot on the floor.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me think through this. The user has been moving through different rooms: first the Attic, then the Bedchamber, and now the Chamber. The goal mentioned earlier was to lift the carrot from the floor of the chamber. 

In the current Chamber, there's a carrot on the floor. The user's previous actions were going south then west, which led them here. The next logical step would be to pick up the carrot since that's the key action mentioned in the initial task. The prompt says to lift the carrot from the floor of the chamber. So the next command should be to take the carrot. But wait, in TextWorld, the command might be "take carrot" or "pick up carrot". The user's previous commands were "go south" and "go west", so following that pattern, the next action should be "take carrot" to pick it up. That's the only thing left to do according to the task. So the answer should be "take carrot".
