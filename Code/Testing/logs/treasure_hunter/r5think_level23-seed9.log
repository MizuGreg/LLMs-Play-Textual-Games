Welcome to another profound session of TextWorld! Here is how to play! Your first objective is to attempt to head north. And then, take a trip east. And then, try to go to the north. With that done, go to the north. With that over with, go to the west. Next, head west. Then, pick up the paper towel from the safe within the sauna. Got that? Good!

-= Bedroom =-
You are in a bedroom. A normal one. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

You can see an opened basket in the room. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this?

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north.

-= Closet =-
Well, here we are in the closet. You start to take note of what's in the room.



There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unblocked exit to the south.



>                                                                                                                                -= Closet =-0/2

-= Office =-
You are in an office. An ordinary one.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what the next step should be. The user has been moving through the rooms: first north from the bedroom, then east to the closet, and then east again to the office. The original goal mentioned was to go north, then east, then north again, then west, then west again, and finally pick up the paper towel from the safe in the sauna.

So far, the user is in the office. The current room is the office, and the exits are east, north, south, and west. The next steps according to the original plan were after getting to the office: go north, then west, then west again. But wait, the user has already gone east from the closet to the office. Now, in the office, the next step in the original plan was to go north. Let me check the original instructions again.

Original goals: head north, then east, then north, then north again, then west, then west, then pick up the paper towel. Wait, maybe the user needs to follow the sequence as given. Let me parse the original message again.

The user's first objective was to attempt to head north. Then take a trip east. Then try to go to the north. With that done, go to the north. With that over with, go to the west. Next, head west. Then pick up the paper towel from the safe within the sauna.

So the sequence is: North, East, North, North, West, West, then pick up paper towel.

So after the initial North (from bedroom to closet), then East (to office), then North (from office to where?), then North again, then West, then West again. So in the office, the next step should be North. Let me check the office's exits. The office has exits to east, north, south, west. So going north from the office would be the next step. Then after that, the next steps would be North again, then West, then West.

So the next action should be go north from the office.

-= Study =-
You've just sauntered into a study.

As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a case. A closed box, which looks ordinary, is in the corner.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.



>                                                                                                                                -= Study =-0/4

-= Basement =-
You find yourself in a basement. A typical one.

You can see a cabinet. You make out a workbench. The workbench is typical. However, the workbench, like an empty workbench, has nothing on it.

There is an unguarded exit to the east. There is an unguarded exit to the south. There is an unguarded exit to the west.



>                                                                                                                                -= Basement =-0/5

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user has been moving through different rooms in the TextWorld game. The original goal mentioned was to go north, then east, then north again, then west, and finally pick up the paper towel from the safe in the sauna. So far, the user has gone from the bedroom to the closet, then east to the office, then north to the study, and then north again to the basement.

Now, in the basement, the user is looking at a cabinet and a workbench. The exits here are east, south, and west, all unguarded. The next step according to the original plan was to go west after heading north. But the user is currently in the basement. Let me check the sequence again.

Original steps: Start by going north (from bedroom to closet), then east (to office), then north (to study), then north (to basement). Then the next step was to go west. So from the basement, going west would be the next move. But the user hasn't done that yet. The current room is the basement, and the next action should be to go west. However, the user's last action was going north to the basement. The next step in the original plan was to go west. So the correct next command would be "go west". But I need to make sure that the user is following the correct path. The user might be confused if they're not on the right track. But according to the instructions, the user is supposed to follow the sequence: north, east, north, north, west, then west again, then pick up the paper towel. So after the basement, going west would be the next step. Therefore, the next action should be "go west".

-= Bedchamber =-
You've just sauntered into a bedchamber.



There is an unblocked exit to the east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.



>                                                                                                                                -= Bedchamber =-0/6
SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user has been moving through different rooms in the TextWorld game. The original goal mentioned was to go north, then east, then north again, then west, and so on. But the user's path so far has been: Bedroom -> Closet -> Office -> Study -> Basement -> Bedchamber.

In the Bedchamber, the available exits are east and west (since north is mentioned as unblocked but maybe not directly). The user's next action was to go west, which led to the Bedchamber. Now, in the Bedchamber, the prompt says there's an unblocked exit to the east and the user can try going north or west. The user's last action was going west, so maybe they need to check if that's part of the intended path.

Wait, the original goal was to go west after some steps. The user has been moving north, east, north, west, and now in the Bedchamber. The next step might be to go north again from the Bedchamber. But the user's last action was going west, so perhaps the next move is to go north. Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go east from the Bedchamber. But the original goal mentioned going west after some steps, so maybe the user is on the right track. The key is to follow the initial instructions: go north, then east, then north, then west, then west again, then pick up the paper towel.

But in the current Bedchamber, the available exits are east and west. The user's last action was going west, so maybe they need to go north from here. Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go east. However, the original goal didn't specify the exact path after the initial directions, so maybe the user is just moving through the rooms. The next logical step might be to go north from the Bedchamber, as that's mentioned as unblocked. So the next action would be "go north".

-= Spare Room =-
You've just walked into a spare room.

You can see a locked coffer.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the west.



>                                                                                                                                -= Spare Room =-0/7
SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user has been moving through different rooms in the TextWorld game. The original goal mentioned was to go north, then east, then north again, then west, and so on. But now, in the Spare Room, there's a locked coffer. The user's current position is the Spare Room, and the possible exits are east (unguarded), south (unblocked), and west (unguarded). The user's next action needs to be determined.

Looking back at the previous steps, the user has been moving north, east, west, etc., but the goal was to eventually pick up the paper towel from the safe in the sauna. However, the current room is the Spare Room, which has a locked coffer. The user hasn't found the sauna yet. The exits from the Spare Room are east, south, and west. The user might need to find a way to open the coffer or proceed to another area. But since the original goal was to go west, maybe the user is following the initial instructions. However, the user is now in the Spare Room, and the next step might be to go west, but the user has already been going west before. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east to proceed further. But the original goal was to go west after some steps. Wait, the original instructions were: go north, then east, then north, then west, then west again, then pick up the paper towel. So maybe after the Spare Room, the next step is to go west. But the user is in the Spare Room, and the west exit is unguarded. So the next action should be to go west. But the user might need to check if that's the correct path. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to open the coffer, but the problem says to only output the action, so perhaps the user is supposed to continue moving. The user's previous action was go north, leading to the Spare Room. Now, the next step is to go west, as per the original plan. So the answer is go west.

-= Canteen =-
Look around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a canteen.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unblocked exit to the south.



>                                                                                                                                -= Canteen =-0/8

Okay, let's see. The user has been moving through different rooms in the TextWorld game. The original goal mentioned was to go north, then east, then north again, then west, and so on. But now, after moving through the Canteen, the next step is to figure out the correct direction.

Looking at the current room, the Canteen, the exits mentioned are east and south. The user's previous actions have been following the initial instructions: north, east, north, west, north, west again. Now, in the Canteen, the exits are east and south. The user's next move should probably be south, as per the previous pattern of moving in directions as instructed. But I need to check if there's any clue about the paper towel in the sauna. However, the current room is the Canteen, so maybe the next step is to go south. Alternatively, the user might need to check if there's a specific direction that leads towards the sauna. But according to the initial instructions, after going west, the next steps were to pick up the paper towel from the safe in the sauna. So maybe the user is on the right track. The correct next action here would be to go south.
</think>go south

-= Sauna =-
You've just sauntered into a sauna.

You make out an opened normal looking safe in the room. The safe contains a paper towel. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting.

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. There is an unblocked exit to the north.



>                                                                                                                                -= Sauna =-0/9
