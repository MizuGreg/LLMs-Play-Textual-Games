I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is how to play! First, it would be fantastic if you could attempt to move east. And then, head south. After that, try to go to the east. If you can finish that, pick-up the fondue from the floor of the cookhouse. Alright, thanks!

-= Kitchenette =-
You arrive in a kitchenette. An ordinary kind of place. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

-= Study =-
You've just sauntered into a study.



There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

There is a disk on the floor.

-= Chamber =-
You're now in the chamber. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.

<think>
Okay, let me figure out what to do next. The user is in a text-based game called TextWorld. They've moved east from the kitchenette into the study, then south into the chamber. The current room is the Chamber. The user is asking if they're making the right moves and if they're close to the goal.

First, I need to recall the previous steps. The user was told to go east, then south, then east again. But in the Chamber, the exits are east and north. The user's last action was going south from the study to the chamber. Now, in the chamber, the options are to go east or north. The user is asking if they're on the right track.

The original goal mentioned was to pick up the fondue from the cookhouse. But the user hasn't found it yet. The current room is the Chamber. The user needs to navigate to the cookhouse. The path so far has been kitchenette → study → chamber. The cookhouse might be in a different area. The exits from the chamber are east and north. The user needs to check which direction leads towards the cookhouse.

But the user hasn't found the fondue yet. The user might need to explore the chamber's contents. The chamber has an exit to the east and north. The user should check if there's a way to get to the cookhouse from here. The user's next action should be to go east or north. The user is asking if they're close, so maybe they need to proceed in one of those directions.

Looking at the previous rooms: the kitchenette had an exit east (to study?), then study had exit south (to chamber) and west. The chamber has east and north. The user needs to find the cookhouse. Maybe the cookhouse is in the east direction from the chamber. Alternatively, the user might need to go north from the chamber. But without more info, the user should try one of the exits. The user's last action was going south, so the next step is to go east or north. The user is asking if they're close, so maybe they should proceed east. The answer would be to go east.

-= Cookhouse =-
You have fallen into the most typical of all possible cookhouses.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.
