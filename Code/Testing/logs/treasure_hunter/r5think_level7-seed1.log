Welcome to TextWorld! Here is how to play! Your first objective is to venture east. And then, go north. And then, travel north. With that over with, pick up the passkey from the floor of the cookery. And if you do that, you're the winner!

Well, here we are in the dish-pit. You start to take note of what's in the room.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded.
