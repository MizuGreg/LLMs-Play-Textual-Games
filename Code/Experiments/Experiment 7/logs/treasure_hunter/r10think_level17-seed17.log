Welcome to another profound game of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First off, open the hatch. After that, make an attempt to move west. Next, ensure that the portal is open. And then, make an attempt to head north. And then, doublecheck that the door is ajar. And then, travel north. And then, pick-up the potato from the floor of the salon. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Kitchen =-
If you're wondering why everything seems so typical all of a sudden, it's because you've just shown up in the kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.



There is a closed hatch leading west. There is an open gateway leading east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.
