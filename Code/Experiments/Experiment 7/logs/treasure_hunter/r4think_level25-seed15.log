Welcome to TextWorld! First thing I need you to do is to head west. If you can manage that, make an attempt to venture north. Next, attempt to travel west. Following that, try to take a trip south. And then, attempt to go to the west. That done, venture north. Following that, make an effort to take a trip north. If you can finish that, attempt to take a trip north. With that done, make an attempt to go to the east. Then, go to the north. Then, recover the loaf of bread from the floor of the dish-pit. That's it!

-= Playroom =-
You arrive in a playroom. A normal kind of place.

You find yourself in a kitchenette. The room is well lit.

You can make out a chair. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

This might come as a shock to you, but you've just walked into a pantry. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You make out a shelf. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the shelf.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a TextWorld game and needs to follow a specific sequence of directions to reach the loaf of bread in the dish-pit. The goal is to navigate through different rooms by moving in certain directions and eventually retrieve the bread.

First, I need to recall the initial instructions. The user was told to go west, then north, then west again, south, west, north, north again, east, north, and finally recover the bread from the dish-pit. But in the current state, the user is in the Cookhouse, and the available exits are north, south, and west. 

Looking at the previous steps: the user started in the Playroom, went west to the Kitchenette, then north to the Lounge, west to the Pantry, north to the Cookhouse. Now, the next step according to the initial plan was to go north again from the Cookhouse. But the user has already done that? Wait, the initial instructions said after reaching the Cookhouse, the next step was to go north again. But the user is now in the Cookhouse, and the available exits are north, south, west. 

Wait, the user's last action was "go north" from the Pantry to the Cookhouse. Now, in the Cookhouse, the next step according to the initial plan was to go north again. But the user is at the Cookhouse, and the exit to the north is unblocked. So the next step should be to go north again. However, the user might be in a loop if moving north again leads back to a previous room. But according to the game's structure, each room is connected in a way that moving north from the Cookhouse should lead to the next room. 

But the user's current position is the Cookhouse. The next step in the initial plan was to go north again. However, the user might have already done that. Wait, the initial instructions said after the Cookhouse, the next step was to go north again. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action should be to go north from the Cookhouse. However, the user might be in a loop if moving north leads back to a previous room. But according to the game's structure, each room is connected in a way that moving north from the Cookhouse should lead to the next room. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is in a loop because the directions are repeating. But the initial plan says after the Cookhouse, go north again. So the next action is to go north. However, the user might need to check if that's the correct step. But according to the initial instructions, the user needs to go north again from the Cookhouse. Therefore, the next action should be "go north".

-= Canteen =-
You have walked into a canteen. Not the canteen you'd expect. No, this is a canteen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You see an opened freezer in the corner. What a letdown! The freezer is empty!

There is an open gate leading east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.
