-= Cookery =-
You are in a cookery. A typical one.

Hey, want to see a case? Look over there, a case. What's that over there? It looks like it's a chair. You shudder, but continue examining the chair. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Silly chair, silly, empty, good for nothing chair.

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text adventure game and needs to follow a series of steps to reach the goal. The current location is the Attic, where they've opened the door leading north. The previous steps involve navigating through various rooms, opening gates, hatches, and portals. The next step in the original plan was to venture north after opening the door, but the user might be stuck in a loop.

First, I need to recall the initial goal: go west, check the gateway, travel west again, open the hatch, open the portal in the office, go north, ensure the attic door is open, then go north again, and finally recover the potato from the salon. 

So far, the user has opened the door in the attic. The next step according to the plan was to go north. But if they're in a loop, maybe they need to find another way. The current room is the Attic with a closed door north and an open portal south. Since the portal is open, maybe they should go south back to the office, then check other steps. Alternatively, if the door is closed, they need to open it again. But the user just opened the door, so perhaps they can go north. However, if that leads them back, they need to find another path. The key is to avoid repeating actions that don't progress. The next action should be to go north, but if that's not working, maybe check the chest or cabinet for the potato. Wait, the goal was to recover the potato from the salon, so maybe after reaching the salon, they need to pick it up. But the current location is the Attic. So the next step is to go north through the open door, then proceed to the next room, perhaps the salon, and then retrieve the potato. But the user might have already done some steps. Need to make sure the next action is correct.
</think>go north

-= Salon =-
Guess what, you are in the place we're calling the salon.

You make out a bookshelf. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

There is an open door leading south. There is an open gate leading east.

There is a potato on the floor.
