It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First step, make an attempt to go south. Then, try to travel west. After that, go south. Then, lift the passkey from the floor of the cubicle. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Cookhouse =-
Well, here we are in the cookhouse.



There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

You have stumbled into the most usual of all possible garages. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.



There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

-= Basement =-
You find yourself in a basement. An ordinary kind of place. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let me try to figure out what to do next. The user is in the Basement, which is part of the game. The goal is to lift the passkey from the cubicle in the Cookhouse. So far, they've gone south from the Cookhouse to the Garage, then west to the Basement. Now, they need to find the passkey.

Wait, the original instructions said to first go south, then west, then south again, then lift the passkey. But in the current state, they're in the Basement. The next step according to the plan was to go south again from the Garage, but maybe that's not the case. Let me check the previous steps again.

Original steps: go south (from Cookhouse to Garage), then west (to Basement), then go south (from Basement to where?), but the Basement has an exit to the east and south. Wait, the user is in the Basement, and the exits are east and south. So maybe they need to go south from the Basement to reach the next area. But the original plan was to go south again after west. So maybe the next step is to go south from the Basement. But the user hasn't done that yet. However, the user's current position is the Basement, and the next step according to the original plan would be to go south again. But the user hasn't done that yet. Wait, the user's previous actions were: go south (Cookhouse to Garage), go west (Garage to Basement). Then the next step in the original plan was to go south again. But in the Basement, going south would take them to another room. However, the user hasn't done that yet. So the next step should be to go south from the Basement. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action is to go south. But the user is in the Basement, and the exit to the south is unguarded. So the user should go south. Then, after that, they might find the cubicle where the passkey is. But the original plan said to go south, then west, then south again. Wait, maybe the user is in the Garage, then went west to Basement, then needs to go south from there. So the next step is to go south. But the user is in the Basement, so the next action is go south. Then, after that, they would be in another room. But the original plan was to lift the passkey from the cubicle in the Cookhouse. Wait, maybe the passkey is in the Basement? Or maybe the user needs to go back north to the Garage, then east to the Cookhouse again? Wait, the original instructions said to first go south (to Garage), then west (to Basement), then go south again. But from the Basement, going south would take them to another area. Maybe the cubicle is in that area. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go back north to the Garage, then east to the Cookhouse again. But the original plan was to go south, west, then south again. So perhaps the user is supposed to go south from the Basement. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next step is to go south. But the user is in the Basement, and the exit to the south is unguarded. So the next action is go south. Then, after that, they might find the cubicle. But the user hasn't lifted the passkey yet. So the next step is to go south, then lift the passkey. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action is to go south. But the user is in the Basement, so the next command is go south.

-= Cubicle =-
I am sorry to announce that you are now in the cubicle.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north.

There is a passkey and a key on the floor.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in the Cubicle, and they need to lift the passkey. The previous attempt to "lift the passkey from the floor of the cubicle" was rejected. The correct command is just "lift the passkey" since the game might expect that without the extra description.

First step: The goal is to go south, west, south again, then lift the passkey. So far, they've gone south (Cookhouse to Garage), west (Garage to Basement), south (Basement to Cubicle). Now, they need to lift the passkey.

Second step: Past actions include moving to the Cubicle. The next step is to lift the passkey. But the previous attempt failed because of extra wording. So the correct command is "lift the passkey".

Third step: Not in a loop yet. The action was just phrased incorrectly. The next action should be "lift the passkey" without the extra description.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in the Cubicle, trying to lift the passkey. The game keeps rejecting "lift the passkey" as not a verb. Hmm, maybe the correct command is just "take the passkey" instead? Or perhaps "get the passkey"? The previous attempts used "lift", but maybe the game expects a different verb.

First, the goal is to go south, west, south again, then lift the passkey. So far, the user has reached the Cubicle. The next step is to pick up the passkey. But the game isn't accepting "lift". Maybe the correct verb is "take" or "get". Let me check the previous interactions. The user tried "lift the passkey from the floor of the cubicle" which was rejected. Then tried "lift the passkey" again. The game says it's not a verb. So maybe the correct command is "take the passkey" or "get the passkey". Alternatively, maybe the game expects "pick up the passkey". But the user has to use a short command. The original instruction said to lift the passkey, but perhaps the correct verb is "take".

So, the next action should be "take the passkey". That's a common verb in text adventures for picking up items. Let me try that.
