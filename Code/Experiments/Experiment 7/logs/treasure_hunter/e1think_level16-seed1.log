Welcome to TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First off, travel west. Okay, and then, travel south. And then, attempt to go east. With that over with, venture east. After that, move north. And then, recover the passkey from the bench. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Studio =-
You've entered a studio.

You can make out a stand. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

There is an unblocked exit to the north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

You've entered a spare room.

Oh, great. Here's a counter. The counter is standard. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text-based game where they need to follow specific directions to find a passkey and win. The current location is the Spare Room. The goal is to travel west, then south, then east, north, and finally retrieve the passkey from the bench.

First, the user has already gone west from the Studio to the Spare Room. Now, the next step according to the initial instructions is to travel south. But in the Spare Room description, there's an exit to the south that's unblocked. So the next logical step is to go south. However, the user might be stuck in a loop if they keep moving between rooms without making progress. But since the Spare Room has a south exit, moving south should take them to the next room. The passkey is on a bench, so after navigating, they need to check benches for it. The next action after south would be to check the bench once they reach the next room. But according to the steps, after going west, south, east, north, then get the passkey. So currently, after west, the next is south. The user's previous action was go west, so now they need to go south. The answer should be "go south".

You've entered a dish-pit.

You make out a refrigerator, so there's that.

There is an unguarded exit to the east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in TextWorld to complete the task. The goal is to follow specific directions: first travel west, then south, then east, then north, and finally recover the passkey from the bench.

Looking at the history, the user started by going west, which took them to the Spare Room. Then they went south, ending up in the Dish-Pit. Now, the next step according to the initial instructions is to attempt to go east. But in the current room (Dish-Pit), the available exits are east and north. The user's next move should be east as per the plan. However, the user's previous action was going south, so they need to check if they're following the correct sequence.

Wait, the initial steps were: west, south, east, north. So after going south to the Dish-Pit, the next step is to go east. The user's last action was going south, so the next command should be east. But the system message says to output only the command. So the next action is to go east. But in the Dish-Pit, there's an unguarded exit to the east. So the correct next step is to go east. Then after that, the next step would be north. But the user hasn't reached the bench yet. So the next command is east.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is playing a text-based game where they need to follow a series of directions to reach the passkey and win. The goal is to navigate through different rooms by moving in specific directions: west, south, east, north, and then retrieve the passkey from the bench.

Looking at the current state, the user has already moved west from the studio to the spare room, then south to the dish-pit, and east to the cookhouse. The next step in the original instructions was to move north from the cookhouse. However, the user's last action was going east, which might have led them to the cookhouse. Now, they need to go north from there.

But the current room is the cookhouse, and the available exits are east and west. The instruction says to move north after going east. Wait, maybe the user is confused about the directions. Let me check the previous steps again.

Original task: travel west, then south, then east, then north, then get the passkey. So after moving east (to cookhouse), the next step is to go north. But in the cookhouse, the exits are east and west. Wait, maybe the user is in the cookhouse and needs to go north, but the description says there's an open passageway east and an exit to the west. Hmm, maybe the north exit is blocked? Or perhaps the user needs to look for the bench where the passkey is.

Wait, the user's last action was going east to the cookhouse. The next step according to the task is to move north. But in the cookhouse, the exits are east and west. The description says "You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north." Wait, maybe that's a hint. The user should go north from the cookhouse. But the available exits are east and west. Maybe there's a typo or misunderstanding. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check the bench in the cookhouse for the passkey. The original task says to recover the passkey from the bench after moving north. So perhaps after moving north, they'll find the bench.

But the current room is the cookhouse. The user needs to go north. However, the description says there's an exit to the west and an open passageway east. Maybe the north exit is not listed, but the prompt says "You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north." So perhaps the user should go north despite the exits listed. Alternatively, maybe the user is in a loop and needs to try a different direction.

Wait, the user's previous steps were: studio (west) -> spare room (south) -> dish-pit (east) -> cookhouse. Now, the next step is to go north from the cookhouse. But the cookhouse's exits are east and west. The prompt says "You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north." So maybe the user should go north even though it's not listed. Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to look for the bench in the cookhouse. But the task says to recover the passkey from the bench after moving north. So perhaps after moving north, they'll find the bench.

But the user's next action should be to go north from the cookhouse. However, the current description says the exits are east and west. Maybe the user is in a loop and needs to try a different action. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check the bench in the current room (cookhouse) for the passkey. But the task says to go north first. So the correct next step is to go north, even if the description doesn't list it. The user needs to follow the original instructions step by step.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in TextWorld according to the given instructions. The goal is to follow a specific path: west, south, east, north, then find the passkey on a bench and win.

Looking at the history, the user started by going west to the Spare Room. Then they went south to the Dish-Pit, east to the Cookhouse, north back to the Studio. Now they're back in the Studio again, which they've already been in before. The next step according to the original instructions was to go east, but after that, they had to move north again. But now they're back in the Studio, which might be a loop.

The current room is the Studio, and the previous actions have led them back here. The next step in the original plan was to recover the passkey from the bench. But in the Studio, there's a stand mentioned, but nothing on it. The user needs to check if the passkey is there or if they need to go somewhere else.

Wait, the instructions say after moving north, they need to recover the passkey from the bench. But in the current Studio, there's no bench mentioned. Maybe the bench is in another room. Alternatively, maybe the passkey is on the stand in the Studio. But the stand isn't described as having anything. So perhaps the user needs to check other rooms.

But according to the steps, after moving north, the next step is to go east, then north again, then find the passkey. But the user is stuck in a loop between Studio and Cookhouse. So maybe the correct path is to go east from the Cookhouse, then north to the Studio, then check the stand for the passkey. But the stand in the Studio doesn't have anything. Alternatively, maybe the bench is in the Cookhouse or another room.

Wait, the original instructions say to "recover the passkey from the bench." So the user needs to find a bench with the passkey. The user has been moving through rooms, but hasn't found the bench yet. The current location is the Studio, which doesn't have a bench. The previous rooms were Spare Room, Dish-Pit, Cookhouse. Maybe the bench is in the Cookhouse. Let me check the Cookhouse description again.

In the Cookhouse, the description says: "Well, here we are in a cookhouse. There is an open passageway leading east. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked." No mention of a bench there. The Dish-Pit had a refrigerator. The Spare Room had a counter. The Studio has a stand. Maybe the bench is in another room not yet explored. Alternatively, maybe the passkey is on the stand in the Studio, but the stand is described as empty.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east from the Cookhouse again. The user is in the Studio now, so maybe they need to go east to the Cookhouse again, then north to the Studio again, but that's looping. Alternatively, go west from the Studio to the Spare Room, then south to the Dish-Pit, then east to the Cookhouse, then north to the Studio again. This seems like a loop. The user needs to find the bench with the passkey. Since the instructions say to go east, then north, then recover the passkey, maybe the bench is in the Cookhouse. But the Cookhouse description doesn't mention a bench. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the user needs to check the stand in the Studio for the passkey. The stand is described as "the thing hasn't got anything on it." So maybe the passkey is not there. Then where is it? The user might need to go to another room. But according to the instructions, after moving north, they should go east, then north again, then find the passkey. But they're stuck in a loop. So perhaps the correct action is to go east from the current Studio to the Cookhouse again, then north to the Studio, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west from the Studio to the Spare Room, then south to the Dish-Pit, then east to the Cookhouse, then north to the Studio again. But this is looping.

Alternatively, maybe the passkey is on the bench in the Cookhouse, but the description doesn't mention it. The user might need to look for it. But the user's next action should be to check the bench in the current room. However, the current room is the Studio, which doesn't have a bench. So perhaps the user needs to go east to the Cookhouse again, then check there. But the user is in the Studio, so the next action should be to go east to the Cookhouse. Wait, the user is in the Studio, and the exit to the east is unblocked. So the next action should be to go east to the Cookhouse again. Then from there, go north to the Studio again. But that's looping. However, maybe the bench is in the Cookhouse. The user needs to check there. So the next action is to go east to the Cookhouse.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Studio again after trying to go east, which wasn't possible. The previous steps were: go west (Spare Room), then south (Dish-Pit), then east (Cookhouse), then north back to Studio. Now, they're stuck trying to go east again, which is blocked.

So, the next step should be to find another direction from the Studio. The available exits here are north, south, and west. The user has already gone west once, but maybe they need to go south again from the Studio. Wait, but the goal was to go west, then south, then east, then north. But after going north back to Studio, they need to find a way to proceed further. Since east is blocked, perhaps they need to go south from the Studio again. But the initial instruction was to go west, then south. Maybe the path requires moving south from the Studio to reach the next area where the passkey is. Alternatively, maybe there's a different route. But according to the game's current state, the only unblocked exits from Studio are north, south, and west. Since east is blocked, the next logical step is to go south again to proceed further. But the user has already done that before. However, maybe the passkey is in a different location. Wait, the goal says to recover the passkey from the bench. So perhaps the user needs to check the current room for the bench. In the Studio, there's a stand, but no items mentioned.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in TextWorld according to the given steps. The goal is to eventually recover the passkey from the bench and win.

First, I need to recap the game's objective step by step. The user has to travel west, then south, then east, then north, and finally get the passkey from the bench. 

Looking at the user's past actions: They started by going west to the Spare Room, then south to the Dish-Pit, east to the Cookhouse, north back to the Studio, then tried east again which wasn't possible, so they went south back to Cookhouse. Now they're in Cookhouse again. 

The next step after the initial movements is to move north from the Cookhouse. But in the current state, the user is in the Cookhouse, and the available exits are east, west, and north. The user needs to go north from here. However, the previous action was going south, which brings them back. So maybe they need to go north from Cookhouse to proceed further.

But the user's last action was going south, which led them back to Cookhouse. The next logical step would be to go north from Cookhouse. However, the user might be stuck in a loop between Studio and Cookhouse. So, the next action should be to go north from Cookhouse to continue towards the next part of the goal, which is to recover the passkey. 

Wait, the user's goal after moving north is to recover the passkey. But in the current setup, the passkey is on a bench, which might be in a different room. The user needs to find the bench with the passkey. So, after moving north from Cookhouse, they might reach a room with the bench. But in the current state, the user is in Cookhouse, and the exits are east, west, and north. So, going north from Cookhouse is the next step. 

Therefore, the next command should be "go north".

Okay, let's break this down. The user is playing a text-based game where they need to follow specific movement steps and find a passkey. The goal is to navigate through different rooms, move in certain directions, and eventually retrieve the passkey from a bench.

First, I need to recall the steps mentioned in the initial task. The user was told to: travel west, then south, then east, then north, and finally recover the passkey from the bench. So the sequence is W → S → E → N → get passkey.

Looking at the user's movement so far: they started in the Studio, went west to the Spare Room, then south to the Dish-Pit, east to the Cookhouse, north back to the Studio. Now they're back in the Studio again, which is the starting point. The next step after the initial movements was supposed to be going east, but that was blocked. Then they tried south again, which took them to the Cookhouse, then north back to Studio. Now they're in a loop between Studio and Cookhouse.

The problem is that the user is stuck in a loop between the Studio and Cookhouse. The next step after the initial directions (W, S, E, N) should be to find the passkey. But in the current setup, the Studio has a stand, but no items. The Cookhouse has an exit to the west (back to Studio) and east. The passkey is supposed to be on a bench, but the user hasn't found it yet.

Wait, maybe the passkey is in the Cookhouse? Or maybe in the Dish-Pit? The user hasn't checked the rooms thoroughly. The initial steps were about moving, but the final step is to find the passkey. So after moving north, they need to check the bench in the current room (Studio) or another room.

But in the current state, the user is in the Studio again. The stand in the Studio is empty. The exit to the north is unblocked, but that's the same as before. The user needs to find the passkey. Maybe the passkey is in the Cookhouse, but the user hasn't checked there yet. Alternatively, maybe the bench is in the Cookhouse.

Wait, the user's last action was going north from Cookhouse to Studio. Now they're in Studio again. The passkey is supposed to be on a bench. The user hasn't checked the Studio's stand for the passkey. Maybe the passkey is there, but the user didn't look. However, the initial description of the Studio says the stand has nothing on it. So maybe the passkey is in another room.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east from the Cookhouse again. The Cookhouse has an exit to the east. So from Cookhouse, go east to the next room, check for the bench. But the user was in the Studio, so maybe they need to go back to Cookhouse and then east again.

But the user is in the Studio again. The next step should be to check the bench in the current room (Studio) or move to another room where the bench is. Since the initial instructions say to recover the passkey from the bench, the user needs to find the bench. The bench might be in the Cookhouse or another room.

Wait, the user's previous steps were: Studio → Spare Room → Dish-Pit → Cookhouse → Studio. Now, they need to find the bench. The Cookhouse has an exit to the west (Studio) and east. Maybe the bench is in the Cookhouse. So from Studio, go east to Cookhouse, then check for the bench. But the user is in Studio again. So the next step is to go east from Studio? But the user tried that before and was blocked. Wait, in the Studio, the exits are north, south, west. East is blocked. So from Studio, the user can't go east. Therefore, the user needs to go to Cookhouse (from Studio, go north? No, the Studio's north exit is unblocked, but that's the same as before. Wait, the user is in Studio, and the exits are north, south, west. So to get to Cookhouse, they need to go south from Studio. But when they went south from Studio, they went to Cookhouse. Then from Cookhouse, they went north back to Studio. Now, they need to find the bench. Maybe the bench is in the Cookhouse. So the user needs to go east from Cookhouse to check.

So the next step is to go east from Cookhouse. But the user is in Studio. So the user needs to go south from Studio to Cookhouse again, then east. But the user is in Studio, so the next action is to go south to Cookhouse, then east. But the user's last action was going north to Studio. So the next step is to go south from Studio to Cookhouse again, then east. But the user is in Studio, so the next command is "go south" to reach Cookhouse again, then "go east" from there. However, the user might be stuck in a loop between Studio and Cookhouse. Therefore, the correct next step is to go east from Cookhouse, but to get there, the user needs to go south from Studio to Cookhouse again. So the next action is "go south" from Studio to Cookhouse, then "go east" to the next room. But the user is in Studio, so the next command is "go south".

-= Cookhouse =-
Well, here we are in a cookhouse.



There is an open passageway leading east. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game where they need to follow a series of directions to reach the passkey and win. The goal is to travel west, then south, then east, then east again, north, and finally recover the passkey from the bench.

Looking at the previous steps, the user has been moving between the Studio, Spare Room, Dish-Pit, and Cookhouse. They tried going east from the Studio but couldn't, so they went south to the Cookhouse again. Now they're back in the Cookhouse, and the next step according to the initial instructions is to move north again. But the user is getting stuck in a loop between the Studio and Cookhouse.

The problem is that the directions are leading them in a cycle. The initial plan was to go west, south, east, east, north, then get the passkey. But after moving west, south, east, they end up back in the Studio, which loops back to the Cookhouse when they go north. So the loop is between Studio and Cookhouse.

To break the loop, the user needs to find a different path. The key is to find the passkey from the bench. The initial instructions mention that after moving north, they need to recover the passkey. But in the current setup, the user hasn't found the bench yet. Maybe the bench is in the Cookhouse or another room.

Wait, in the Cookhouse, there's an open passageway east and an exit west. The user has been going back and forth between Studio and Cookhouse. Maybe the bench is in the Cookhouse, and the user needs to check there. But the user hasn't looked for items yet. The initial description of the Studio mentions a stand but nothing on it. The Cookhouse doesn't mention a bench, but maybe the user needs to check the rooms again.

Alternatively, maybe the passkey is in the Dish-Pit or Spare Room. The user has been moving through these rooms but hasn't checked them thoroughly. The initial steps required moving west, south, east, etc., but perhaps the passkey is in one of these rooms.

But according to the game's feedback, the user is stuck in a loop. The next step should be to find the passkey. Since the user is in the Cookhouse, maybe they need to check the items there. However, the game's descriptions don't mention a bench in the Cookhouse. The user might need to look for it in another room.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east from the Cookhouse, which was mentioned as an open passageway. If they go east from the Cookhouse, they might reach a room with the bench. The initial instructions said to go east after moving north, so perhaps that's the path.

But the user is currently in the Cookhouse and the next step is to go north again, which loops back. So the correct action here is to go east from the Cookhouse, which was previously mentioned as an open passageway. That would take them to the next room where the bench might be. So the next command should be "go east" from the Cookhouse.

-= Closet =-
You arrive in a closet. A normal one.

You scan the room for a rack, and you find a rack. The rack is normal. But there isn't a thing on it. You see a workbench. However, the workbench, like an empty workbench, has nothing on it.

There is an open door leading north. There is an open passageway leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in TextWorld following a specific sequence of movements. The goal is to eventually recover the passkey from the bench and win the game.

First, I need to recall the initial instructions: travel west, then south, then east, then north, and finally get the passkey from the bench. The user has been moving through rooms, but they might be stuck in a loop between the Studio and Cookhouse. 

Looking at the current room, the user is in the Closet. The previous actions led them back to the Studio, which then loops back to the Cookhouse. The user tried going east from the Studio but couldn't, so they went south to Cookhouse again. Now, in the Closet, the options are north, west, or east. 

The next step should be to check if there's a bench with the passkey. The Closet has a workbench, but it's empty. The user needs to find the passkey. Maybe the passkey is in the workbench or another room. Since the user hasn't found it yet, they need to explore further. 

But the instructions say to go east after moving north. The user is in the Closet, so going east might lead to another room. However, the previous attempt to go east from Studio was blocked. But in the Closet, east is unblocked. So perhaps going east from Closet is the next step. 

Wait, the user's goal is to recover the passkey from the bench. The Closet has a workbench, but it's empty. Maybe the passkey is in another room. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go north from the Closet to the next room. But the user's previous steps have them looping between Studio and Cookhouse. 

The key is to find the bench with the passkey. The user hasn't found it yet. So maybe the next step is to check the workbench in the Closet. But the workbench is empty. Alternatively, moving west from the Closet might lead to another room. 

But according to the game's structure, the user needs to follow the sequence: west, south, east, north, then get the passkey. The user is currently in the Closet. The next step might be to go north to the next room, but the user needs to check if the passkey is there. 

Alternatively, maybe the passkey is in the Cookhouse or Studio. But the user hasn't found it yet. The user needs to explore all possible paths. Since the user is in the Closet, the next action should be to check the workbench or look around for the passkey. However, the game might require moving to a specific room where the bench is located. 

Given the previous steps, the user might need to go north from the Closet to the next room, then check for the bench. But the user's last action was going east to the Closet. So the next step is to check the workbench or look for the passkey there. However, the workbench is empty. 

Wait, the user's goal is to recover the passkey from the bench. The user hasn't found the bench yet. So maybe the next step is to go west from the Closet to the Cookhouse again, then check the bench there. But the user needs to follow the sequence. 

Alternatively, maybe the passkey is in the Studio's stand. The user has been in the Studio multiple times. The stand in the Studio is empty. So perhaps the passkey is in another room. 

The user needs to find the bench with the passkey. The Closet's workbench is empty. The user might need to go to the Cookhouse again, check the bench there. But the user's previous steps have them looping between rooms. 

The correct next action is to go north from the Closet to the next room, then check for the bench. But the user needs to follow the sequence. The user's next step should be to go north from the Closet. However, the user is in the Closet, and the options are north, west, or east. The user should check the bench in the next room. 

But according to the game's structure, the user needs to go east after moving north. The user is in the Closet, so going north might lead to the next room. The user should proceed to check the bench there. 

Therefore, the next action is to go north from the Closet.

-= Bathroom =-
Of every bathroom you could have sauntered into, you had to walk into a standard one.

You can make out a closed dresser. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a bench. You see a passkey on the bench. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You make out a table. The table is ordinary. On the table you make out a bug.

There is an open door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to follow a series of movements and retrieve the passkey. So far, they've moved west, south, east, north, south, east, north again. Now they're in the Bathroom, and they found the passkey on the bench. The next step is to pick up the passkey.

Wait, the game's objective says "recover the passkey from the bench" and then win. So the user has already found the passkey, but maybe they need to pick it up. The current location is the Bathroom, and the passkey is on the bench. The command here should be to take the passkey. But the previous actions were moving around, and the user hasn't picked it up yet. So the next action should be to take the passkey. But the available commands might be limited. Let me check the previous messages. The user just entered the Bathroom, and the description mentions the passkey is on the bench. So the correct action is to take the passkey. But the system might require a specific command like "take passkey" or "get passkey". Since the user is supposed to output the command, the answer should be "take passkey" or similar. But looking at the history, the user has been using "go" commands. However, in this case, the action is to pick up the item, not move. So the correct command here is "take passkey".
