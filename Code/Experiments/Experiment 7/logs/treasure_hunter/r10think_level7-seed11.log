Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. Your first objective is to go to the east. With that done, attempt to go to the north. Then, make an effort to go to the east. And then, lift the sponge from the floor of the sauna. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Office =-
You arrive in an office. An usual kind of place. You start to take note of what's in the room.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to first go east, then north, then east again, and finally lift the sponge in the sauna. So far, the user has navigated through the office, studio, kitchen, cookhouse, and back to the kitchen, then to the sauna. In the sauna, they found the sponge on the floor.

The next step according to the original plan was to lift the sponge. But the user hasn't done that yet. However, the current location is the sauna, and the sponge is there. So the next action should be to pick up the sponge. But the previous action was going east, which led to the sauna. Now, in the sauna, the available actions are to go west or pick up the sponge. Since the sponge is on the floor, the correct command would be to take the sponge. But the user might have to use the exact command, maybe "take sponge" or "pick up sponge". The system might expect "take sponge" as the command. So the next step is to take the sponge from the floor in the sauna.
