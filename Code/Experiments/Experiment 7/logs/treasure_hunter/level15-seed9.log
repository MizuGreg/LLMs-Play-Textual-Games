I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! First step, make an attempt to take a trip south. And then, open the passageway in the basement. After that, move south. Then, make an attempt to travel west. Then, attempt to venture north. Then, retrieve the poem from the floor of the bedchamber. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Attic =-
Guess what, you are in a place we're calling an attic.

Were you looking for a suitcase? Because look over there, it's a suitcase. You can make out a locker. You can see a display.

There is an open gateway leading east. There is an open hatch leading north. There is an open door leading south.

-= Basement =-
You're now in the basement. Let's see what's in here.

You can make out a locked chest. You see a safe. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You make out a shelf. The shelf is normal. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is a closed passageway leading south. There is an open door leading north. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is stuck in the basement, trying to open the passageway south, but the game isn't recognizing the command. The initial goal was to go south from the attic, open the passageway in the basement, then move south again, go west, north, retrieve the poem, and stop.

So far, the user went south from the attic to the basement, then tried to open the passageway south. But the game keeps saying it only understood "open passageway" and not "south". Maybe the correct command is to open the passageway that's leading south, but the game expects a different phrasing. The user has been repeating "open passageway south" which might not be the right syntax. The game might require a different verb or a different way to specify the direction. Maybe "open the passageway to the south" or "open the south passageway". Alternatively, maybe the passageway is already there and the user needs to just move through it instead of opening it. But the game says the passageway is closed, so opening it is necessary. The user needs to find the right command to open it. Since the previous attempts aren't working, perhaps using a synonym like "unblock" or "open the south passage" might work. The next step is to try a different phrasing of the command to open the passageway south.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's tackle this. The user is in the basement and needs to open the south passage. They've tried multiple commands like "open passageway south" and "open the passage south", but the game isn't recognizing them. The goal is to proceed through the passages to retrieve the poem.

First, the goal steps are: go south from attic, open basement passageway south, move south, go west, north, get poem. So far, they've gone south to the basement and tried to open the passage. The next step should be moving south after opening it.

But the game isn't accepting "open passageway south". Maybe the correct command is "open the passage south" or "unblock the passage". Since the user is stuck, they need to try a different phrasing. The previous attempts all involve opening the passage, but maybe the game expects a different verb or structure. Alternatively, maybe the passage is already open, and the user needs to just move through it. But the game says it's closed. So the key is to find the right command to open it. Since all previous attempts failed, perhaps using "unblock" instead of "open" might work. So the next action should be "unblock the passage south".

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in the basement trying to open the south passage. They've tried multiple commands like "open passageway south" and "open the passage south", but the game isn't recognizing them. The goal is to proceed through the passages to get the poem.

First, the goal steps are: go south from attic, open basement passageway south, move south, go west, north, retrieve poem. So far, they've gone south to the basement and tried to open the passage. The next step should be moving south after opening it.

But the game isn't accepting "open passageway south". Maybe the correct command is "open the passage south" or "unblock the passage". Since the user is stuck, they need to try a different phrasing. The previous attempts all involve opening the passage, but maybe the game expects a different verb or structure. Alternatively, maybe the passage is already open, and the user needs to just move through it. But the game says it's closed. So the key is to find the right command to open it. Since all previous attempts failed, perhaps using "unblock" instead of "open" might work. So the next action should be "unblock the passage south".
