I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! First of all, you could, like, venture west. And then, open the gate inside the garage. After that, head south. And then, travel south. Then, make an attempt to travel south. And then, lift the chocolate bar from the floor of the chamber. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Bedchamber =-
I just think it's awesome that you're in a bedchamber now. Let's see what's in here.



There is an open passageway leading east. There is an open gateway leading west.
