You are now playing a fast paced game of TextWorld! First of all, you could, like, travel north. And then, make an effort to go west. And then, retrieve the passkey from the floor of the bar. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Canteen =-
Well, here we are in the canteen.



There is an unguarded exit to the north. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

There is a cauliflower on the floor.

-= Closet =-
You are in an usual kind of place. That is to say, you're in a closet. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.



You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Bar =-
You are in a bar. A normal one.



There is an unblocked exit to the east. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

There is a passkey on the floor.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out the best way to proceed here. The user is in the Bar, and they need to retrieve the passkey from the floor. The goal is to get the passkey and then exit.

First, the user has already gone north from the Canteen to the Closet, then west to the Bar. Now, in the Bar, there's a passkey on the floor. So the next step should be to pick up the passkey. But the current prompt says "There is a passkey on the floor." So the action should be to take the passkey. But the user's previous actions were moving directions. Wait, the user needs to pick up the passkey first. Then, after getting it, they can exit. But the exits here are east and south. The exit to the east is unblocked, but the user needs to check if they can go south. However, the user's goal is to get the passkey, so the immediate next step is to pick it up. But in TextWorld, sometimes you have to use 'take' or 'get' commands. But the user's previous actions were 'go north' and 'go west'. So maybe the next step is to 'take passkey' or 'get passkey'. But the user's instruction says to output a short command like 'go north'. So perhaps the correct command here is 'take passkey' or 'get passkey'. But the user's previous actions were moving, so maybe the next step is to pick up the passkey. Then, after that, they can exit. So the next action should be to take the passkey. But the user's current location is the Bar, and the passkey is on the floor. So the correct command is 'take passkey' or 'get passkey'. But the user's previous commands were 'go north' and 'go west', so maybe the next step is to 'take passkey'. Then, once that's done, they can exit. But the user's goal is to retrieve the passkey and then stop. So the next action is to take the passkey.
