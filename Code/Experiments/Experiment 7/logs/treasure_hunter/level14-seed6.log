Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First, it would be good if you could take a trip west. If you can do that, head north. Then, make an effort to travel west. With that done, venture west. Then, recover the chocolate bar from the floor of the workshop. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Cookhouse =-
You arrive in a cookhouse. A standard kind of place.

You make out a chair. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.
