Welcome to TextWorld! First, it would be good if you could ensure that the portal in the sauna is open. Once you have opened the portal, take a trip south. Once you finish that, make an effort to travel east. Okay, and then, head south. After that, attempt to go to the east. After that, try to move south. With that accomplished, take a trip west. Okay, and then, go to the west. With that accomplished, pick up the latchkey from the floor of the studio. Alright, thanks!

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's try to figure out what's going on here. The user is stuck in a loop between the Sauna and Cubicle rooms. The goal is to open the portal in the sauna, then go south, east, south again, west, and finally pick up the latchkey from the studio. But the player keeps getting stuck between going east and west, which leads them back to the same rooms.

First, the goal steps are: open the portal in the sauna, then go south, east, south, east, south, west, west, then pick up the latchkey. But the player hasn't managed to open the portal yet. The initial instructions said to ensure the portal is open, but the current state shows it's closed. So maybe the first step is to open the portal.

But how? The portal is closed. The user might need a key or some action to open it. However, in the current scenario, the player is stuck in a loop between the two rooms. The available commands don't include opening the portal directly. The user has tried going east and west repeatedly, which is causing the loop.

So, the problem is that the player is stuck in a loop without progressing towards the portal. The next step should be to find a way to open the portal. Maybe there's an object in the cubicle that can be used to open it. The mantle in the cubicle is empty, but perhaps there's something else. Alternatively, maybe the player needs to use the latchkey from the studio, but that's the final goal.

Wait, the user's last action was going west, which brings them back to the sauna. The portal is still closed. The user needs to open it. Since the portal is closed, maybe they need to use a key. But the latchkey is in the studio, which hasn't been reached yet. So the player needs to find a way to open the portal without going through the loop.

Alternatively, maybe the portal can be opened by another action. The user might need to look for a way to open it. The command 'open' is available, so perhaps trying 'open portal' would work. But the user hasn't tried that yet. The previous actions were just moving between rooms, so the next step should be to try opening the portal.

You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a shelf. But there isn't a thing on it.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

-= Steam Room =-
You find yourself in a steam room. A typical one.

You can make out a box, so there's that. You make out a rack. The rack is typical. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can see a table. The table is normal. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

-= Studio =-
You've just shown up in a studio. You can barely contain your excitement.

Oh, great. Here's a stand. The stand appears to be empty.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

There is a latchkey on the floor.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to open the portal in the sauna, then follow a series of directions: south, east, south, east, south, west, west, and finally pick up the latchkey from the studio.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Studio room, which has a latchkey on the floor. The previous steps involved moving through various rooms, but the user got stuck in a loop between the Sauna and Cubicle. However, after opening the portal and moving through the kitchens, bar, spare room, laundry place, and steam room, the user finally reached the Studio.

Now, the next step is to pick up the latchkey. The user has already opened the portal and followed the required directions up to this point. The only remaining task is to take the latchkey from the floor. Since the latchkey is present here, the correct action is to take it. The user didn't pick it up earlier, so the next command should be 'take latchkey'.
