Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, make absolutely sure that the hatch is open. Then, take a trip east. With that over with, make an attempt to venture east. Once you succeed at that, open the gate in the study. Then, make an attempt to go to the north. Once you manage that, attempt to go to the west. With that over with, take a trip north. With that over with, go north. And then, pick up the loaf of bread from the floor of the launderette. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Garage =-
You are in a garage. An ordinary one. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

Hey, want to see a cabinet? Look over there, a cabinet. You can see a locked chest.

There is a closed hatch leading east. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in a text-based game. The main goal is to open the hatch, go east, then open the gate in the study, go north, west, and finally pick up the bread from the launderette.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Study room. The previous attempts to open the gate north were unsuccessful, and the system is indicating that the user is stuck in a loop. The user tried "open gate north" multiple times, but the system didn't recognize it as a valid action. Wait, maybe the correct command is just "open gate" without specifying north? Or perhaps the gate is already open, and the user needs to use a different verb.

Wait, the Study room has a closed gate leading north. The user needs to open that gate. But the system is responding that the previous actions didn't make progress. So maybe the correct command is "open gate north" but the system is not accepting it. Alternatively, maybe the gate is already open, and the user needs to use a different action. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use "push gate" or "pull gate" instead of "open".

Alternatively, perhaps the user is supposed to use "go north" after opening the gate. But the user tried "go north" before, but the system didn't recognize it. Wait, the user's previous steps were: open hatch, go east to salon, go east to study, then try to open gate north multiple times. The system is not accepting "open gate north" as a valid action. Maybe the correct command is just "open gate" without specifying direction, but in the Study room, the gate is north. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use "use key" or something else.

Wait, the Study room has a locked portmanteau. Maybe the user needs to open that first to get a key? But the original goal didn't mention that. The original instructions said to open the gate in the study. So maybe the gate is locked, and the user needs to find a way to open it. But the system is not recognizing "open gate north" as a valid action. Maybe the correct command is "open gate" without the direction, but the system is expecting "open gate north". Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use a different verb like "push" or "pull".

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go north through the gate once it's open. But the user is stuck trying to open it. Since the system is not accepting "open gate north", maybe the correct action is "go north" directly, assuming the gate is open. But the gate is closed. Hmm.

Wait, the user's last action was "open gate north" again, and the system is still not recognizing it. The user is in a loop because the system isn't responding to the command. So the next step is to try a different command. Maybe the correct action is "go north" without opening the gate first. But the gate is closed. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use "use key" on the gate, but there's no key mentioned.

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to use "push gate" or "pull gate" instead of "open". Let me check the previous responses. The user tried "open gate north" multiple times, but the system didn't respond. So the correct action might be "push gate north" or "pull gate north". But the system might expect "open gate north".

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to use "go north" even if the gate is closed. But that's not possible. The user needs to open the gate first. Since the system isn't accepting "open gate north", maybe the correct command is "open gate" without direction, but the system might not recognize that. Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to use "use key" on the gate, but there's no key mentioned.

Wait, the Study room has a locked portmanteau. Maybe the user needs to open that first to get a key. But the original goal didn't mention that. The user's goal is to open the gate in the study. So maybe the portmanteau is a red herring. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to find a key in the salon or elsewhere.

But according to the original instructions, the user is supposed to open the gate in the study. So the correct action is to open the gate, but the system is not recognizing "open gate north". Therefore, the user needs to try a different command. Maybe "open gate" without direction, or "push gate north". Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to use "go north" through the gate once it's open, but the gate is closed. So the user needs to find a way to open it.

Since the system is not accepting "open gate north", the user should try a different action. Maybe "push gate north" or "pull gate north". Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to use "use key" on the gate, but there's no key. Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to look for a key in the salon or elsewhere.

But given the current state, the user is in the Study room, and the gate is closed. The user needs to open it. Since the system isn't accepting "open gate north", the user should try a different command. Maybe "open gate" without direction. Let's try that.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to open the hatch, go east, open the study's gate, go north, west, then north again, and finally pick up the bread from the launderette.

So far, the user has opened the hatch, gone east to the salon, then east again to the study. In the study, they tried opening the gate north multiple times, but it wasn't working. Then, after some attempts, they successfully opened the gate and went north to the chamber. From there, they went west to the playroom.

Now, the next step according to the original plan was to go north again. But in the playroom, the user is told there's an unguarded exit to the north. So maybe they need to go north from here. But the original plan also mentioned going west after opening the gate in the study. Wait, maybe the user is a bit confused here. Let me check the steps again.

Original steps: After opening the study's gate, go north, then west, then north again. But in the current state, the user is in the playroom. The playroom has an exit to the north. So perhaps the next step is to go north from the playroom. But the user's previous action was going west from the chamber to the playroom. So the next step would be to go north from the playroom. However, the original plan said after opening the gate in the study, go north, then west, then north. But the user is now in the playroom, which is a different location. Maybe the bread is in the playroom? Or perhaps the launderette is elsewhere.

Wait, the original goal says to pick up the bread from the floor of the launderette. The user hasn't reached the launderette yet. So the current path is: garage -> salon -> study -> chamber -> playroom. The next steps would be to continue moving towards the launderette. The playroom has an exit to the north, so maybe going north from here would lead to the next area. But the user needs to find the launderette. Alternatively, maybe the bread is in the playroom. But the user hasn't checked yet.

But according to the original steps, after going north from the study, then west, then north again. But the user is now in the playroom. Maybe the next step is to go north from the playroom. However, the user might be in a loop if they keep moving between rooms without progressing towards the launderette. So the key is to continue moving towards the launderette. The playroom's north exit might lead to the next area. So the next action should be to go north from the playroom.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Playroom and Chamber. The goal is to pick up the bread from the launderette. So far, the user has opened the hatch, gone east, opened the study's gate, went north to the chamber, then west to the playroom, and back again. The next step should be to find the launderette. But the current path isn't leading there. Maybe the bread is in the playroom or chamber. The user needs to check those areas. Since the playroom is mentioned, maybe going east from there would lead to the launderette. But the user keeps looping between playroom and chamber. The key is to break the loop by trying a different action, like checking the desk in the chamber for the bread. Alternatively, maybe the launderette is in the basement. The user was in the basement earlier. So perhaps going north from the playroom to the basement again. But the user is in the playroom again. The next action should be to go north from the playroom to the basement, then check there for the bread.

FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to pick up the bread from the launderette. So far, they've been looping between the Playroom, Chamber, and Basement. The key is to find the launderette. The bread is supposed to be in the launderette, which hasn't been visited yet. The user needs to explore the basement east passageway or check the desk in the chamber. Since the basement has an open passageway east, maybe that's where the launderette is. The next step is to go east from the basement to find the launderette and pick up the bread.

You've just sauntered into a chamber.

You can see a desk. The desk is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open gate leading south. There is an open portal leading north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

You arrive in a playroom. You begin to take stock of what's here.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

-= Chamber =-
You've just sauntered into a chamber.

You can see a desk. The desk is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open gate leading south. There is an open portal leading north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.
