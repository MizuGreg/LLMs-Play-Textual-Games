Welcome to TextWorld! Here is how to play! First step, move west. With that accomplished, make an attempt to venture north. After that, head north. With that over with, attempt to travel east. And then, make an effort to venture east. After that, make an attempt to head south. And then, head south. Following that, make an effort to take a trip south. Then, lift the shadfly from the floor of the laundromat. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Restroom =-
You are in a restroom. An ordinary kind of place.

You see an opened cabinet close by. The cabinet is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever!

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

-= Cookery =-
You arrive in a cookery. An usual kind of place.

You smell a great smell, and follow it to a case. You see a refrigerator. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this?

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

-= Steam Room =-
You make a grand eccentric entrance into a steam room. You begin looking for stuff.

You make out a counter. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. Sometimes, just sometimes, TextWorld can just be the worst. You make out a shiny rack. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can see a shiny shelf. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Office =-
You are in an office.

What's that over there? It looks like it's a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The table is ordinary. The table appears to be empty. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a stand. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing hasn't got anything on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

You arrive in a basement. An ordinary one. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this TextWorld game and needs to figure out how to win. The goal mentioned in the welcome message is to lift the shadfly from the floor of the laundromat. So the main objective is to find the shadfly and pick it up.

Looking at the user's actions so far: they started by going west, then north, then north again, then south, back to the office, north again to the basement, and then south again. It seems like they're moving between rooms but not making progress toward the shadfly. The current location is the basement again, which they've been in before.

The problem here is that the user might be stuck in a loop between the basement and the office. The previous actions of going north and south are just switching between these two rooms without any new discoveries. The game's clues mention that the shadfly is in the laundromat, but the user hasn't reached there yet.

So the next step should be to find a way to get to the laundromat. The path mentioned in the welcome message includes moving west, north, east, south, etc., but the user hasn't tried going east from the basement. The basement's description says to try going east or south. Since south leads back to the office, maybe east is the way to go. But the user needs to check if there's a door or exit that leads to the laundromat. Alternatively, maybe there's a hidden item or a different path.

Wait, in the basement, the user is told to try going east or south. The south is the office, which they've already been to. Maybe east is the key. But the user hasn't tried that yet. So the next action should be to go east from the basement to see if that leads to the laundromat or another room that's closer. If that's not possible, maybe there's another way, but based on the current information, going east is the next logical step to break the loop and move toward the laundromat.

-= Bedroom =-
You've entered a bedroom.



You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

There is an onion on the floor.
