Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, you could, like, ensure that the oak door is open. After that, attempt to go north. With that accomplished, make an effort to go to the west. Following that, lift the fresh laundry scented key from the floor of the shower. After you have picked up the fresh laundry scented key, doublecheck that the fresh laundry scented door inside the shower is unlocked. And then, ensure that the fresh laundry scented door inside the shower is open. And then, take a trip north. Then, make an effort to go to the east. Okay, and then, open the portal within the studio. After you have opened the portal, head north. Then, pick-up the latchkey from the floor of the cubicle. Alright, thanks!

There is a closed oak door leading north. There is an open wooden gateway leading west.

FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let me try to figure out what to do next. The user is in the Shower area. They have the fresh laundry scented key. The goal was to unlock and open the fresh laundry scented door. But the system said they need to unlock it first with the key. So, the next step should be to use the key on the door.

Wait, the previous action was trying to open the door, but it's locked. So the correct action is to unlock it with the key. The user already picked up the key, so now they need to use it. The command should be "unlock fresh laundry scented door" or something similar. But the system might expect a specific phrasing. Let me check the previous commands. The user tried "open fresh laundry scented door" but got an error. So the correct action is to unlock it first. Therefore, the next step is to unlock the door with the key. Then, after unlocking, open it. Then proceed north, then east, then open the portal in the studio. But the current step is to unlock the door. So the next command should be "unlock fresh laundry scented door".

<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in a text-based game. The main goal is to open various doors and collect items to progress through the levels.

First, the user has already opened the oak door in the closet, then went north to the Serious Studio, then west to the Shower. In the Shower, they picked up the fresh laundry scented key and tried to unlock the door. The system kept prompting them to use the key, but the user kept trying to open the door instead. Now, after successfully unlocking the door, they need to open it. But the system is rejecting "open" as a verb here, so maybe the correct command is "open fresh laundry scented door" even though it's already unlocked. Wait, no, the user just unlocked it, so the next step is to open it. But the system might be expecting "open" without the door name, or maybe "use" the key. But the previous attempt was "open fresh laundry scented door", which worked once. Maybe the system is confused because the door is already unlocked, so the next action is to proceed north. Let me check the previous steps again.

The user's goal was: open oak door, go north, go west, pick up key, unlock and open the fresh laundry door, then go north, east, open portal, etc. So after unlocking the door, the next step is to open it. But the system is not accepting "open" as a verb here. Maybe the correct command is "open door" without specifying, but the door is fresh laundry scented. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go north from the shower. Wait, after opening the door, the next step is to go north into the next area. But the user is in the shower, so after opening the door, they should go north. But the system might be expecting "open" again. However, the user tried "open fresh laundry scented door" and it worked once. Now, the system is saying "That's not a verb I recognise" again. Maybe the correct command is "open door" without the description. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the key again. But the key is already used to unlock. Hmm. The user is stuck in a loop where they keep trying to open the door, but the system is not recognizing "open" as a verb. So the next step is to try a different command, maybe "use" the key, but the key is already used. Alternatively, proceed north after opening the door. But the system is rejecting the command. So the correct action is to go north after opening the door. But the user is in the shower, so after opening the door, they can go north. Therefore, the next command should be "go north".

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Salon, Workshop, and Spare Room. They've been going back and forth between these areas. The main goal was to open various doors and collect items to progress. But now, after opening the fresh laundry door, they ended up in the workshop again.

First, I need to recap the game's objective. The user had to open the oak door, go north, west, pick up the key, unlock and open the fresh laundry door, then proceed to open the portal in the studio, etc. But it seems like after opening the fresh laundry door, they're looping between rooms without making progress towards the portal or the final goal.

Looking at the current position, the user is in the Serious Workshop again. The previous steps involved moving east and west between rooms. The next step should be to find the portal in the studio, but the user hasn't reached that yet. However, the current path seems to be going in circles.

The user might need to find a different path or use a synonym for an action. Since the system is rejecting "go north" or "go east" repeatedly, maybe the correct action is to use a different verb or check for items. But in the current room, there's nothing but a mantle and exits. The key item was already collected earlier.

Wait, the user had to open the portal in the studio after going north from the shower. But the current path doesn't seem to be leading towards the studio. Maybe the user needs to go back to the studio area. However, the previous steps led them back to the workshop. Perhaps the correct next step is to go east from the workshop to reach the studio again. But the user has been looping between rooms, so maybe the correct action is to try a different direction or check for a hidden item. However, the game might require specific commands. Since the user is in the Serious Workshop, the next step could be to go east to reach the studio, but the system might be expecting a different command. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the key again, but the key was already used. 

Given the loop, the next action should be to go east from the Serious Workshop to reach the studio and open the portal. But the user has been going back and forth, so the correct command is "go east".

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The user is stuck in a loop between the Salon, Workshop, and Spare Room. They've been going back and forth between these areas without making progress towards the final goal of opening the portal in the studio.

First, the game's objective was to open the oak door, go north, west, pick up the key, unlock and open the fresh laundry door, then proceed to open the portal in the studio. But the user has been looping between rooms without reaching the studio.

Looking at the current position, the user is in the Spare Room again. The exits are east and north. The previous steps involved moving east and west repeatedly, which is causing the loop. The key item was already collected earlier, so the next step should be to find the portal in the studio. However, the user hasn't reached the studio yet.

The next action should be to go north from the Spare Room to reach the studio. But the user has been going back and forth, so maybe the correct command is "go north" to escape the loop and proceed to the studio. Alternatively, "go east" from the Spare Room to reach the studio. But the system might expect a different command. Since the user is in the Spare Room, the correct next step is to go north to reach the studio and open the portal.
