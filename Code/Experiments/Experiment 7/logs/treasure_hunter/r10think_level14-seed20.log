I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Your first objective is to go to the north. With that accomplished, attempt to go to the west. Okay, and then, make an attempt to go to the north. Then, take a trip north. With that over with, pick up the loaf of bread from the floor of the launderette. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Study =-
You've entered a study. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

A locked portmanteau is in the corner.

There is an open gate leading north. There is an open door leading west.
