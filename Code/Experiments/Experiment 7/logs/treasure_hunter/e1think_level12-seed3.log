Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to make an effort to go south. With that done, head west. And then, lift the worm from the floor of the kitchenette. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Bar =-
You've entered a bar. You can barely contain your excitement.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

-= Laundromat =-
You are in a laundromat.



There is an unguarded exit to the north. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a TextWorld game where they need to follow specific steps. The initial instructions say to go south, then west, pick up the worm from the kitchenette, and then stop. 

First, the user went south from the bar to the laundromat. Now, they're in the laundromat. The next step according to the original instructions was to go west. But the user hasn't done that yet. Wait, the user's last action was "go south", which took them to the laundromat. The next step in the original plan was to go west from the bar, but after going south, they're now in the laundromat. So maybe the next step is to go west from the laundromat.

But the user's current location is the laundromat. The laundromat has an exit to the north and west. The original goal was to go south (from bar to laundromat), then west (from bar to kitchenette?), but maybe the path is different. Wait, the original instruction said: "go south. With that done, head west. And then, lift the worm from the floor of the kitchenette." So after going south (to laundromat), the next step is to go west from there. But the laundromat's west exit is unblocked. So going west from laundromat would take them to the next location, perhaps the kitchenette. Then, once there, pick up the worm.

But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action should be to go west from the laundromat. However, the user's previous action was "go south", which is already done. Now, they need to go west. But the user's last input was "go south", and the current location is laundromat. So the next step is to go west. But the user might be in a loop if they keep moving between locations without progress. However, the instructions say to go south, then west, then pick up the worm. So the next step is to go west from laundromat. But the user's last action was "go south", so the next action should be "go west".

-= Kitchenette =-
A well framed board tells you that you are now in the kitchenette.

You smell a sickening smell, and follow it to a saucepan. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

There is a worm on the floor.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Kitchenette now. The goal is to lift the worm from the floor and put it in a place. The previous steps were going south from the bar to the laundromat, then west to the kitchenette. Now, in the kitchenette, there's a worm on the floor.

First, the goal is to pick up the worm. The user needs to lift it. The current location has the worm, so the next step is to pick it up. The previous actions have already gotten them to the kitchenette, so the next logical step is to take the worm. The command should be "take worm" or "lift worm". Since the game mentions "lift the worm", maybe "lift worm" is the correct command. I should check if there's any other step needed, but according to the initial instructions, after getting to the kitchenette, the next step is to lift the worm. So the next action is to lift it.

That's not a verb I recognise.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to complete a text-based game where they need to follow specific steps. The goal is to pick up a worm from the kitchenette and put it in a place, but the user is having trouble with the command "lift worm" not being recognized.

First, I need to recall the game's objective. The user was told to go south, then west, lift the worm, and then stop. So far, they've gone south from the bar to the laundromat, then west to the kitchenette. Now, in the kitchenette, there's a worm on the floor. The next step is to pick up the worm.

But the system rejected "lift worm". Maybe the correct verb is "pick up" instead of "lift". In many text adventures, "pick up" is the standard command for taking an object. So the user might need to use "pick up worm" instead. Alternatively, maybe "take worm" is the correct verb. But since "lift" wasn't working, trying "pick up" makes sense.

Also, checking if there's a loop. The user has already gone through the bar, laundromat, and now the kitchenette. The previous actions didn't loop back, so no loop detected. The next step is definitely to pick up the worm. Since "lift" didn't work, switching to "pick up" should be the correct command.
</think>pick up worm
