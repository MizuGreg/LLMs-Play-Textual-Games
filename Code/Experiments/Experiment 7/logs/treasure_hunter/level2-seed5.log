Your objective is to lift the fondue from the floor of the cookhouse.

-= Cookhouse =-
You have fallen into the most typical of all possible cookhouses.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

There is a fondue on the floor.

-= Chamber =-
You're now in the chamber. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a game where they need to lift the fondue from the cookhouse floor. They started by going west, which led them to the Chamber. Now, in the Chamber, they have to figure out the next steps.

First, the goal is to lift the fondue. So far, they've gone west, which might have been part of finding the right path. The Chamber has multiple directions: east, north, and maybe others. The prompt mentions that in the Chamber, the user should consider the exits. The initial advice was to go west, but now they're in the Chamber, so maybe they need to check other directions.

Looking at the current environment, the user needs to find a way to reach the fondue. The previous action was going west, but maybe that's not enough. The next step might be to check other directions like east or north. The user needs to find the right path to the fondue. Since the Chamber has an unguarded exit to the east and north, maybe moving east or north would be the next step. But the user needs to avoid loops. If they keep going back and forth, they need to try different directions. The key is to find the correct path that leads to the fondue. So, the next action should be to go east or north, depending on what's needed. Since the initial advice was to go west, but now in the Chamber, perhaps going east is the next step. But the user needs to ensure they're not repeating the same action. So, the next command should be to go east.

Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is in a game where they need to lift the fondue from the cookhouse floor. The environment seems to be switching between different rooms like the Cookhouse and Chamber. The goal is to get the fondue up, but the current setup might be tricky.

Looking at the history, the user first went west from the Cookhouse, which led them to the Chamber. Then they tried going east, which brought them back to the Cookhouse. Now, the same Cookhouse description is appearing again, so maybe they're in a loop between these rooms. The key is to find an unguarded exit to get out, but the problem is that the fondue is still on the floor. 

The user's past actions have been going west and east, which might not be helping. The next step should be to find a way to lift the fondue. But how? Maybe there's a way to interact with the fondue once they're in the right place. Since the fondue is on the floor, perhaps they need to pick it up. But the current prompt says "There is a fondue on the floor," so maybe the next action is to pick it up. However, the user hasn't done that yet. But the previous actions were moving around, not interacting with the fondue. 

Wait, the initial objective was to lift the fondue. So maybe the correct sequence is: first, find the fondue, then lift it. But in the current state, the user is in the Cookhouse again, and the fondue is still there. The previous actions didn't involve picking it up. So the next step should be to try lifting it. But the user's last action was going east, which brought them back to the Cookhouse. So maybe the next action is to try picking up the fondue. However, the game might require moving to a specific location first. Alternatively, maybe the exit is the way to go, but the user needs to get the fondue out. 

But the problem is that the user is stuck in a loop between the Cookhouse and Chamber. The instructions mention that if the previous actions didn't make progress, they need to try a different action. Since going west and east is just moving between rooms without progress, maybe the next step is to interact with the fondue directly. So the next command should be to pick up the fondue. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the answer should be "take fondue" or something similar. But the game might require specific commands. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go to a place where they can lift it. But the current description says the fondue is on the floor, so perhaps the correct action is to pick it up.
