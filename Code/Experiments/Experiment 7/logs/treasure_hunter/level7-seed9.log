Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First, it would be fantastic if you could make an effort to head east. With that done, make an attempt to go to the east. After that, go to the north. And then, retrieve the teapot from the floor of the canteen. That's it!

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is in a text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and retrieve a teapot from the canteen. The current setup seems to be looping between the Basement and Spare Room. The user has been repeatedly going east, south, north, and so on, but it's not making progress.

First, I need to recall the original goal: go east, then north, and retrieve the teapot from the canteen's floor. But the user is stuck in a loop between the Basement and Spare Room. Each time they go north from the Spare Room, they end up back in the Basement, and vice versa. That suggests that the path isn't leading them towards the canteen yet.

Looking at the current room descriptions, the Basement has an exit to the east, south, and west. The Spare Room has a north exit. But the user hasn't found the canteen or the teapot. Maybe the canteen is in a different part of the map. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to find a way to get to the canteen from the current location.

Wait, the initial instruction was to go east, then north, then retrieve the teapot. But the user's movements are going back and forth between the Basement and Spare Room. Perhaps the correct path is to go east from the Basement, but the user is going south instead. Let me check the previous steps.

The user first went east from the Bedchamber to the Basement. Then went south to the Spare Room. Then tried going north again, which brought them back to the Basement. It seems like the user is stuck in a loop between the Basement and Spare Room. The problem is that the user hasn't moved east from the Basement, which was the first step. The initial instruction said to go east first, then north. But the user might have gotten confused with the directions.

Alternatively, maybe the canteen is in the east direction from the Basement. The Basement has an exit to the east, which might lead to the canteen. But the user hasn't tried that yet. The user kept going south and north, which are the other directions. So the next step should be to go east from the Basement to reach the canteen and pick up the teapot.

But the user's last action was going south again, which is why they're stuck. So the correct action now is to go east from the Basement, not south. The user needs to break the loop by choosing the east exit instead of south. That would take them towards the canteen.

You've just walked into a sauna. Let's see what's in here.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

-= Canteen =-
You've entered a canteen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

There is a keycard and a teapot on the floor.
