Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First, it would be fantastic if you could make an effort to head east. With that done, make an attempt to go to the east. After that, go to the north. And then, retrieve the teapot from the floor of the canteen. That's it!

-= Bedchamber =-
You find yourself in a bedchamber. A standard kind of place.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Basement =-
You arrive in a basement. An ordinary kind of place.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user wants me to navigate through the TextWorld game to retrieve the teapot from the canteen's floor. The initial steps were going east from the bedchamber, which led to the basement. Now, in the basement, the user is told to go south or west. The previous actions were "go east" and then "go south" (assuming the next step after the basement was going south). But the user is at the basement again, maybe in a loop.

First, I need to confirm the goal: retrieve the teapot from the canteen's floor. The steps so far: started in the bedchamber, went east to the basement. Now, in the basement, the options are east (exit), south (unblocked), or west (unguarded exit). The user might be stuck in a loop between basement and another room. 

The next step should be to go south from the basement to proceed further. But if that's not working, maybe go west instead. However, the user's previous action was going east, so maybe the next step is to go south. But the user might be in a loop, so changing the direction could help. Alternatively, check if the canteen is reachable through the basement. The teapot is in the canteen's floor, so the path must lead to the canteen. The user needs to find the right path to the canteen, then pick up the teapot. 

So, the next action should be to go south from the basement to proceed towards the canteen. If that's not working, maybe go west, but the user needs to avoid loops. The key is to find the correct path to the canteen. The answer should be "go south" as the next step.

-= Spare Room =-
You've entered a spare room. The room is well lit.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in TextWorld. The goal is to go east, then north, and retrieve the teapot from the canteen's floor.

First, the initial step was "go east" from the bedchamber, which led to the basement. Then, the user tried "go south" from the basement, moving to the spare room. Now, the current room is the spare room, and the prompt says to try going north. 

Wait, the user's previous action was "go south", which took them from the basement to the spare room. The next step according to the original instructions was to go north after east. But in the spare room, the hint says to try going north. So maybe the next step is to go north from the spare room. But the user has to check if that's the correct direction towards the canteen.

But the problem is, the user might be looping. Let me check the steps again. The original plan was: go east (done), then go north (next step). But after going east to basement, then south to spare room, now they need to go north from here. If going north from the spare room leads them towards the canteen, that's the right direction. But if that's not working, maybe they need a different approach. However, the instructions say to not repeat actions if stuck. Since the previous action was south, maybe "go north" is the next step. But the user has to make sure they're not in a loop. The current room is spare room, and the next direction is north. So the next action should be "go north".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through these rooms to reach the canteen and get the teapot. The initial instructions were to go east, then north, and then retrieve the teapot from the canteen's floor.

First, the user started in the bedchamber, went east to the basement. Then they went south to the spare room and back north to the basement again. Now they're back in the basement, which seems like a loop. The problem is that the basement is mentioned again, so maybe they're stuck in a loop between the basement and the spare room.

The goal is to get to the canteen's floor to get the teapot. So far, the user hasn't reached the canteen yet. The current location is the basement. The previous actions were going east, south, north, which brings them back to the basement. So they need to find a way out of the basement to get to the canteen.

Looking at the basement description, there's an exit to the east, south, and west. The user tried going south before, which led to the spare room, but going north again brings them back to the basement. Maybe they need to go east from the basement. The exit to the east is unblocked, so perhaps that's the way to go. But the initial instruction was to go east first, then north. Maybe the canteen is in a different direction. Alternatively, maybe the canteen is in the spare room or another area.

Wait, the user's goal is to retrieve the teapot from the canteen's floor. So they need to get to the canteen. The current location is the basement. The basement has an exit to the east. Maybe going east from the basement leads to the canteen. But in the previous steps, when they went east from the basement, they might have gone to the spare room? Or maybe not. The initial move was east from the bedchamber to the basement. Then south to the spare room, then north back to the basement. So maybe the exit to the east from the basement is the way to go. Let's check the basement description again: "There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the west." So the basement has exits to east, south, and west. The user is currently in the basement. The previous action was going north, which brought them back. So maybe the next step is to go east from the basement. That would be the first time they're going east from the basement. Let's try that. If they go east, maybe they reach the canteen or another room leading to it. Alternatively, maybe the canteen is in the spare room, but the user hasn't checked there yet. But the initial instructions said to go east, then north, then get the teapot. So perhaps the correct path is to go east from the basement, then proceed to the canteen. But the user is stuck in a loop between the basement and spare room. So the next action should be to go east from the basement to break the loop and proceed towards the canteen.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in a text-based game. Their goal is to eventually retrieve the teapot from the canteen's floor. Let me break down the steps they've taken so far.

First, they started in the bedchamber, went east to the basement. Then they went south to the spare room, north back to the basement, then east to the sauna. Now, they're in the sauna, and the prompt says to go north or west. The previous actions have them looping between the basement and sauna, maybe not making progress toward the canteen.

The user's goal is to go east, then north, then get the teapot. But the current location is the sauna. The next step should be to move either north or west. Since they've been going east and south, maybe trying a different direction. The key is to avoid loops. The previous action was going east to the sauna, so now they need to choose between north or west. Let's check the room description again. The sauna has unguarded entrances to north and west. The user needs to find the path that leads them closer to the canteen. Since the canteen is mentioned in the original instruction, perhaps the correct path is to go west from the sauna, which might lead to a different area. Alternatively, going north might lead back to the basement. But the user needs to get to the canteen's floor. Maybe the correct direction is west, but I need to make sure. Since the user is in the sauna, going west might be the right move to proceed toward the canteen. So the next action should be west.

Looking at the history, the user started in the bedchamber, went east to the basement, then tried going south to the spare room, then north back to the basement. Then they went east to the sauna, then west back to the basement. Now they're back in the basement again, and the next step is to figure out what to do next without getting stuck in a loop.

The current location is the basement. The previous actions have been moving east and west, which are leading them back and forth between the basement and sauna. The user needs to move towards the canteen. The original plan was to go east, then north. But the basement seems to be a loop. Maybe the correct path is to go east from the basement to the sauna, then north from there. But the user just came back from the sauna to the basement. So perhaps they need to go east again from the basement to the sauna, then north. But the user is in the basement again, so the next step should be to go east to the sauna again. Wait, but the user already did that. Alternatively, maybe there's another way. The basement has an exit to the east (sauna) and west (spare room). The user needs to get to the canteen, which is probably north from the basement. But the original instruction was to go east first, then north. Maybe the user is getting confused between the directions.

Wait, the initial instruction was: first go east, then go north, then retrieve the teapot from the canteen. So after going east (to the basement), then go north. But in the basement, going north is not an option. The basement's description says there's an exit to the east, and you can go south or west. So maybe the user needs to go east from the basement to the sauna, then north from the sauna. The sauna's description says you can go north or west. Going north from the sauna might lead to the canteen. Then, once in the canteen, retrieve the teapot. So the next step is to go north from the sauna. But the user is currently in the basement. So the next action should be to go east to the sauna, then north. But the user is in the basement, so the next command is go east. But the user just did that, and then went west back. So maybe the user needs to go east again from the basement to the sauna, then north. So the next step is go east.

Okay, let's try to figure out what's going on here. The user is in a text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and retrieve a teapot from the canteen's floor. The main goal is to get the teapot.

Looking at the history of movements: the user started in the bedchamber, went east to the basement, then south to the spare room, north back to the basement, east to the sauna, west back to the basement, and then east again to the sauna. It seems like they're stuck in a loop between the basement and sauna. 

The user's task is to reach the canteen's floor to get the teapot. So far, they haven't reached the canteen. The current location is the sauna, but the previous steps show they're moving between basement and sauna without progress towards the canteen.

The next step should be to find a way out of the sauna towards the canteen. The sauna's description mentions unguarded entrances to north and west. But the user has already tried going west and ended up back in the basement. Maybe the north direction from the sauna leads somewhere else. However, the user hasn't tried that yet. Alternatively, maybe there's a different path from the basement that wasn't explored yet.

Wait, the basement has an exit to the east (sauna) and west (unguarded exit). The user has been going back and forth between basement and sauna. To get to the canteen, they might need to find a different route. Perhaps the canteen is in a different part of the map. The initial instructions said to go east, then north, then retrieve the teapot from the canteen's floor. But the user hasn't reached the canteen yet.

So, the next action should be to try moving north from the sauna, as that's the other unguarded entrance. If that doesn't work, maybe there's another way. But according to the game's current state, the user is in the sauna, and the options are north or west. Since west leads back to basement, maybe north is the way to go. However, the user's previous action was east, leading to sauna, and now they're in sauna again. So the next step is to try going north from the sauna.

Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is in a text adventure game, and their goal is to retrieve the teapot from the canteen floor. Let me recap the steps taken so far.

Starting from the bedchamber, they went east to the basement, then south to the spare room, north back to the basement, east to the sauna, west back to the basement, east again to the sauna, and then north to the canteen. Now, in the canteen, they see a keycard and a teapot on the floor. The objective is to get the teapot.

Wait, the user's previous action was going north to the canteen. Now, in the canteen, the teapot is on the floor. So the next logical step is to pick up the teapot. But the game might require using a command like 'take teapot' or something similar. However, the user's instructions say to output only the command, nothing else. But in the game's context, the available actions are usually directions (north, south, etc.) or taking items. Since the teapot is on the floor, the correct action would be to take it. But I need to check if the game allows that. The previous interactions have been moving between rooms, and now they're in the canteen. The teapot is there, so the next step is to take it. The user's last command was 'go north' to reach the canteen. Now, the next action should be to take the teapot. But the user's instructions say to output only the command. So the answer should be 'take teapot' or 'get teapot'. But I need to make sure that's the correct command here. Alternatively, maybe the game expects 'pick up teapot'. However, based on the previous commands, the user has been using 'go' commands. But in the canteen, the teapot is on the floor, so the action would be to take it. Therefore, the next command should be 'take teapot'.
