FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game where they have to follow a series of steps to reach the goal. The current scenario is in a basement with a closed gateway leading east and an open gate south. The user has already unlocked the gateway, so the next step according to the initial instructions was to ensure the gateway is open. But maybe that's not enough.

Looking at the previous steps: the user first opened the gate in the launderette, went north to the basement, unlocked the gateway with the latchkey, and now the gateway is unlocked. The next step was to make sure the gateway is open. Wait, the user might have already unlocked it, but maybe they need to open it. But the system message says "ensure that the gateway inside the basement is open." So maybe after unlocking, they need to open it again. But the user tried to go east, but the gateway is closed. Wait, the user's last action was unlocking the gateway, and now the system says "There is a closed gateway leading east." So maybe unlocking doesn't automatically open it. So the next step is to open the gateway. But the user tried to go east, but it's closed. So the user needs to open it first. But the system message says "You have to unlock the gateway with the latchkey first," which the user did. So maybe the gateway is now unlocked but still closed. So the next step is to open it. But how? Maybe there's a key or a way to open it. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the latchkey again. But the user already unlocked it. Hmm.

Wait, the initial instructions said: after unlocking the gateway, ensure that the gateway is open. So maybe after unlocking, the user needs to open it. But the system message says the gateway is closed. So the user needs to open it. But how? Maybe there's a key or a tool. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the latchkey again. But the user already used it to unlock. Maybe the next step is to open the gateway. But the user tried to go east, but it's closed. So the correct action is to open the gateway. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next step is to open the gateway. But the user might have to use the latchkey again. Or maybe there's another way. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to find the key to open it. But the user hasn't found the key yet. Wait, the initial steps mention recovering the cabbage from the table, but that's later. So maybe the user is stuck here. The user needs to open the gateway, but the system message says it's closed. So the next action should be to open the gateway. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the correct command is "open gateway".

Okay, let's break this down. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in a text adventure game. The goal is to open various gates and navigate through different areas, eventually recovering the cabbage from the table.

Looking at the current state: The user is in the Chamber, which has a closed hatch leading east, an open passageway west, and exits north and south. The previous steps involved opening gates, unlocking the basement gateway, and moving through the bar and playroom. Now, the next step according to the initial instructions was to ensure the hatch in the chamber is open. The user hasn't done that yet.

The user's past actions include opening the gate in the launderette, going north to the basement, unlocking the gateway, opening it, then going east to the bar, playroom, and now the chamber. The next step mentioned was to ensure the hatch in the chamber is open. Since the hatch is closed here, the user needs to open it. However, the user might be stuck in a loop if they keep moving east and west without progressing. But in this case, the hatch is a new element, so the correct action is to open it. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next step is to open the hatch. However, the system message says the hatch is closed, so the user needs to open it. But the user's last action was going east, so maybe the next step is to open the hatch. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the correct command is "open hatch".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the steps to win the game. The goal is to open gates, navigate through areas, and eventually recover the cabbage from the table.

Looking at the current state: The user is in the Salon, which has a locked trunk, an empty suitcase, and a dresser. The exits are east, north, south, and west. The previous steps involved moving through various rooms, opening gates, and now they're in the Salon. The next step according to the initial instructions was to go east after opening the hatch. But the user is in the Salon, so maybe they need to find the cabbage here or proceed further.

Wait, the initial instructions said after opening the hatch in the chamber, go east, then attempt to go east again, then take a trip east, then ensure the hatch is open, then go north, then west, then north again, and finally recover the cabbage from the table. But the user has been moving through different rooms without finding the cabbage. Maybe the cabbage is in the Salon or another room. However, in the Salon description, there's no mention of a table or cabbage. The user might need to check other rooms or find a different path.

But the user's last action was going west from the Washroom to the Salon. Now, in the Salon, the exits are east, north, south, west. The user needs to proceed towards the cabbage. Since the cabbage is supposed to be on a table, maybe the user needs to check the trunk or dresser. But they are locked or empty. Alternatively, maybe the cabbage is in the Washroom or another room. However, the user hasn't found it yet. The next step might be to check the trunk or dresser for the cabbage. But the trunk is locked. So the user needs to find a key or way to open it. Alternatively, maybe the cabbage is in the Studio or another room. But the user hasn't checked those yet.

Wait, the initial steps mentioned recovering the cabbage from the table. The user might have missed it in previous rooms. The current room is the Salon, which doesn't mention a table. The Washroom had a drawer and a safe, but they were empty. The Studio had a locker, which might be a place to check. But the user is in the Salon now. Maybe the next step is to go east from the Salon to the Studio, check the locker, and see if the cabbage is there. Alternatively, the user might need to go north or south from the Salon. But the instructions say to go east after opening the hatch. The user might be stuck in a loop between rooms without finding the cabbage. So the next action should be to go east to the Studio and check the locker. But the user's previous action was going west, so maybe the correct next step is to go east again. However, the user might need to find a different way. But according to the instructions, after the hatch is open, the user should go east, then east again, then take a trip east, etc. So the next step is to go east from the Salon. The command would be "go east".

Okay, let's break this down. The user is trying to follow the steps to win the game, which involves opening gates, navigating through different areas, and eventually recovering the cabbage from the table.

Looking at the current state: The user is in the Lounge, which has an opened portmanteau that's empty. The exits are south and west. The previous steps included moving through the Washroom, Salon, Studio, Chamber, etc., but the cabbage hasn't been found yet. The goal is to recover the cabbage from the table, which hasn't been located in any of the rooms so far.

The user's past actions include opening gates, moving through various rooms, but the cabbage is still missing. The next step according to the initial instructions was to go east after opening the hatch, but the user is now in the Lounge. The Lounge doesn't mention a table or cabbage, so maybe the cabbage is in a different room. The user might be stuck in a loop between rooms without finding the cabbage. The next action should be to check the portmanteau or other objects in the Lounge, but since it's empty, maybe the user needs to proceed further. The exit to the south or west could lead to another room where the cabbage is. However, the user hasn't found it yet. The correct next step is to go south or west, but the user might need to try a different direction. Since the previous actions didn't find the cabbage, the user needs to explore other rooms. The next command should be to go south or west. But the user's last action was going north to the Lounge, so maybe the next step is to go south. However, the user might be in a loop, so using a synonym like "go south" instead of repeating "go east" if that's not working. But in this case, the user is in the Lounge, so the next step is to check the exits. The command would be "go south" or "go west". Since the user needs to find the cabbage, maybe the correct direction is south. But the user hasn't found it yet. The answer should be "go south".

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Washroom and Salon. They've been going back and forth, but haven't found the cabbage yet. The goal is to recover the cabbage from the table. So far, the user has opened several gates, navigated through different rooms, but the cabbage hasn't been located.

In the current state, the user is in the Salon, which has a locked trunk, an empty suitcase, and an empty dresser. The exits are east, north, south, and west. The previous actions didn't find the cabbage, so maybe the user needs to check other rooms or find a different way. The user might be repeating the same actions, leading to a loop. The next step should be to try a different direction, like going east instead of west, or checking the trunk for the cabbage. But the trunk is locked, so maybe the user needs a key. However, the user hasn't found a key yet. Alternatively, the cabbage might be in another room, and the user needs to explore further. The correct next action would be to go east to check the Studio again, where the locker was. But the user has already been there. Alternatively, the user might need to go north or south. But the instructions mention going east after certain steps. Since the user is in the Salon, the next step is to go east. However, the user has been going back and forth, so maybe using a synonym like "go east" is necessary. The answer should be "go east".

-= Washroom =-
You find yourself in a washroom. An usual kind of place. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a drawer. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. The drawer is empty! What a waste of a day! You make out an opened standard looking safe here. The safe is empty! What a waste of a day!

There is an unguarded exit to the north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

In the current state, the user is in the Washroom again after going south from the Lounge. The previous actions didn't lead to any progress. The next step should be to check other rooms or find a different way. The user might need to explore the north exit instead of repeating south and west. The correct action would be to go north to check the next room, maybe the Studio or another area where the cabbage could be. Since the user is in a loop, changing direction is necessary.

Okay, the user is in the Bedchamber now. The goal is to find the cabbage from the table. So far, the user has been moving through various rooms without success. The previous steps didn't lead to the cabbage, so maybe the user needs to check the cushion on the floor or look for a table here. The Bedchamber description mentions a cushion but no table.

You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a drawer. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. The drawer is empty! What a waste of a day! You make out an opened standard looking safe here. The safe is empty! What a waste of a day!

There is an unguarded exit to the north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

There is a cushion on the floor.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

-= Washroom =-
You find yourself in a washroom. An usual kind of place. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a drawer. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. The drawer is empty! What a waste of a day! You make out an opened standard looking safe here. The safe is empty! What a waste of a day!

There is an unguarded exit to the north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the west.
