You are now playing a life changing session of TextWorld! First, it would be fantastic if you could head south. And then, make an effort to move west. Following that, go north. After that, lift the banana from the floor of the workshop. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Shower =-
You've entered a shower.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to win this game. The user mentioned that the goal is to head south, then west, then north, lift the banana from the workshop, and win. But the current environment is the Kitchenette.

First, I need to check where I am. The user is in the Kitchenette, which is part of the canteen and shower areas. The previous steps were going south from the shower to the canteen, then west to the kitchenette. Now, the next step according to the initial instructions was to go north from the kitchenette. But the current description says there's an unguarded exit to the north and east. The bowl is on the floor, but the banana isn't mentioned yet.

Wait, the original plan was to go south, then west, then north, then lift the banana. But after going west to the kitchenette, the next step should be north. However, the user is in the kitchenette, and the next step is to go north. But the current room's description says there's an exit to the north. So maybe going north from the kitchenette would take me to the next area. But the banana is in the workshop, so maybe after moving north, I need to find the workshop. But the current room is the kitchenette, so maybe the next step is to go north to reach the workshop. However, the user hasn't mentioned the workshop yet. Alternatively, maybe the banana is in the kitchenette, but the description says there's a bowl on the floor, not a banana. So perhaps I need to move north to the next area, then find the banana.

Wait, the initial instructions said after going north (from the kitchenette), then lift the banana from the workshop. So maybe after going north from the kitchenette, I reach the workshop, then pick up the banana. But the current room is the kitchenette, so the next step is to go north. The user's previous action was going west to the kitchenette, so the next step is to go north. But the current description says there's an exit to the north. So the next action should be go north. Then, once in the workshop, pick up the banana. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next step is to go north from the kitchenette. But the user's last action was going west, so the next step is go north. However, the user might be in a loop if they keep moving between rooms without progressing. But according to the current description, going north from the kitchenette is possible. So the next action is go north.

-= Workshop =-
You find yourself in a workshop. A typical kind of place.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

There is a banana on the floor.
