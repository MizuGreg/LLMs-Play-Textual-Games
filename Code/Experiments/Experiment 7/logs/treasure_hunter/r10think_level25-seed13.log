Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an exciting round of TextWorld? You do! Here is how to play! First step, attempt to go east. And then, move north. Once you accomplish that, try to head west. That done, head west. Okay, and then, make an attempt to go to the west. Once you finish that, travel west. If you can get through with that, make an attempt to go south. If you can finish that, try to go east. After that, make an attempt to venture south. And then, travel south. Then, retrieve the keycard from the floor of the bar. Alright, thanks!

-= Salon =-
You find yourself in a salon. An ordinary kind of place. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You see a closed portmanteau here. Were you looking for a desk? Because look over there, it's a desk. But there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the desk.

There is an unguarded exit to the east. There is an unguarded exit to the north. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

-= Washroom =-
Well, here we are in a washroom. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

You make out a locked dresser. You can see a bench. But there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You scan the room, seeing a table. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a table? But there isn't a thing on it. Sometimes, just sometimes, TextWorld can just be the worst.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

-= Restroom =-
You are in a restroom. It seems to be pretty ordinary here. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.
