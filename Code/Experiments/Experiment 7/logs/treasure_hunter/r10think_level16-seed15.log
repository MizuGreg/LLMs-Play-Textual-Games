Welcome to another profound episode of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First step, go west. Then, try to take a trip south. Then, venture west. And then, make an effort to venture south. After that, make an effort to go to the east. Then, pick up the sandwich from the floor of the shower. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Studio =-
You find yourself in a studio. A typical one.

You can see a closed box right there by you.

There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

You are in a pantry. A standard kind of place.

You make out a rack! But there isn't a thing on it.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the south. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

-= Lounge =-
Fancy seeing you here. Here, by the way, being the lounge. Let's see what's in here.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a bar. The bar is ordinary. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a couch. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The couch is typical. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You think about smashing the couch to bits, throwing the bits in the dump, etc, until you get bored. Look over there! a desk! Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is an unguarded exit to the east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

Ah, the workshop. This is some kind of workshop, really great standard vibes in this place, a wonderful standard atmosphere. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Lounge and Playroom. The goal was to go west, then south, west, south, east, pick up the sandwich from the shower. But the current path is looping between Lounge and Playroom.

First, I need to recap the goal. The original instructions said: go west, then south, west, south, east, then pick up the sandwich in the shower. But the user has been moving between Lounge and Playroom, which might not be the correct path.

Looking at the current location, the user is in the Lounge again after multiple north/south moves. The previous steps might not have followed the correct sequence. The user needs to find the shower where the sandwich is. Maybe the correct path involves different directions.

Wait, the initial steps were: go west (from Studio to Pantry), then south (to Bedchamber), west (to Lounge), south (to Workshop), north (back to Lounge), then maybe east? But the user kept going north and south, looping. Maybe the sandwich is in a different room not yet explored. Alternatively, perhaps the user needs to find a different exit or object.

But according to the game's environment, the shower isn't mentioned yet. The user hasn't encountered it. So maybe the correct path is to continue moving east from the Lounge, as there's an unguarded exit east. But the user was told to go east after some steps. Wait, the original plan was after going west, south, west, south, then east. Maybe after reaching the Workshop, going east would lead to another area. But the user is stuck in a loop, so perhaps they need to try a different direction or find another way.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to look for the shower in the current rooms. But the Lounge description mentions a desk, but nothing about a shower. The Playroom has a bed, but no shower. The Workshop has a safe and a stand. The Bedchamber has exits but no shower. The Pantry has a rack. The Studio has a closed box. Maybe the shower is in a different part of the map not yet explored.

Wait, the initial instruction said to pick up the sandwich from the floor of the shower. So the user needs to find the shower. Maybe the correct path is to go east from the Lounge, as there's an exit east. Let me check the previous steps. The user was in the Lounge, then went north to Playroom, then south back to Lounge. If they go east from Lounge, that's an unguarded exit. Maybe that leads to a room with the shower. So the next action should be go east from the Lounge.
