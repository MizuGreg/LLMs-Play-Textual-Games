Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Your task for today is to recover the teaspoon from the floor of the cookhouse.

-= Cookhouse =-
You arrive in a standard kind of place. That is to say, you're in a cookhouse.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a teaspoon on the floor.
