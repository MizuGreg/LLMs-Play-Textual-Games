You are now playing a exciting round of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. Your first objective is to venture east. And then, take a trip north. Next, retrieve the loaf of bread from the counter within the pantry. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Shower =-
You've just sauntered into a shower.

You can see a rack. But there isn't a thing on it.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Study =-
You are in a study. A standard one. The room is well lit.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

-= Pantry =-
You've just walked into a pantry. Let's see what's in here.

You can make out a counter. The counter is ordinary. On the counter you can see a loaf of bread.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me figure out how to proceed. The user's goal is to first go east, then north, retrieve the bread from the pantry counter, and win. So far, they've already gone east from the shower into the study, then north into the pantry. Now they're in the pantry, and the bread is on the counter. The next step is to pick up the bread. But the prompt says to retrieve the loaf of bread from the counter within the pantry. So the next action should be to take the bread. Wait, but in TextWorld, sometimes you need to use specific commands like 'take' or 'get'. The current room is the pantry, and the bread is on the counter. So the correct command would be 'take loaf of bread' or 'get bread'. But looking at the previous actions, the user was told to go east, then north. Now they're in the pantry, so the next step is to take the bread. The answer should be 'take loaf of bread' or similar. But the system might expect 'take bread' if that's the correct command. Let me check the previous messages. In the pantry description, it says "On the counter you can see a loaf of bread." So the correct command is likely 'take loaf of bread'. But maybe the game expects 'get' instead. However, the user's previous actions were 'go east' and 'go north', so following that pattern, the next action should be 'take loaf of bread'. Therefore, the next command is 'take loaf of bread'.
