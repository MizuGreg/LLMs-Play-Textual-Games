I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First off, try to head east. That done, travel north. Then, lift the passkey from the floor of the spare room. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Steam Room =-
You arrive in a steam room. A standard kind of place.

You see a box. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is typical. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is an unguarded exit to the east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

go east
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Laundry Place =-
You find yourself in a laundry place. A normal kind of place. You start to take note of what's in the room.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

go north

-= Spare Room =-
I never took you for the sort of person who would show up in a spare room, but I guess I was wrong.



There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

There is a passkey on the floor.

That's not a verb I recognise.
