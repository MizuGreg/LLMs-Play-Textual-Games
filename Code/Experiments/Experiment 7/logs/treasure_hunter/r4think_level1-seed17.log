FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to recover the fondue from the pantry floor. So the main goal is to get the fondue. The current location is the Pantry again after moving north from the Office. The previous steps were going south from the Kitchen to the Pantry, then north to the Office, and now back to the Pantry.

Wait, the user is in the Pantry again. The fondue is on the floor here. But the problem is that the exits are blocked? Or maybe not. The initial prompt said that in the Pantry, the exits are east, north, south. But when they went north from the Pantry, they went to the Office, which has an exit to the south. So maybe the loop is between Pantry and Office. The user is stuck in a loop between those two rooms.

The user needs to find a way out of the loop to reach the fondue. But the fondue is in the Pantry. So maybe the problem is that they can't exit the Pantry to get to the fondue. Wait, the fondue is on the floor of the pantry. So maybe the user just needs to pick it up. But the game might require moving to a position where the fondue is accessible.

But the user's previous actions led them back to the Pantry. The message says "You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south." So maybe all exits are blocked except for the ones that lead to other rooms. But the user is in the Pantry again, and the fondue is there. So perhaps the correct action is to pick up the fondue. But the game might require moving to a specific location.

Wait, the initial instruction says the objective is to recover the fondue from the floor of the pantry. So maybe the user is already in the pantry where the fondue is. The problem is that they can't exit, so they need to find a way to get the fondue without leaving. But the game might require them to go through the exits to reach the fondue. But the user is stuck in a loop between Pantry and Office. So maybe the solution is to go east from the Pantry. Let me check the previous steps.

The user went south from Kitchen to Pantry, then north to Office, then back to Pantry. Now, in the Pantry again, the exits are east, north, south. The Office has an exit to the south. So if the user goes east from the Pantry, maybe that's a new path. But the previous messages didn't mention east being blocked. So perhaps the correct next step is to go east to find a way out of the loop and reach the fondue. But the user needs to pick up the fondue. Alternatively, maybe the fondue is in the Pantry, and the user just needs to take it. But the game might require moving to a position where the fondue is accessible. So the next action should be to go east, then maybe north or south to find the exit. But the user is in a loop, so they need to break it by trying a different direction. Since going north led to the Office, maybe going east is the way to go.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to recover the fondue from the pantry floor. So far, they've been moving between the Pantry and Office, going back and forth. The previous actions were going south to the Pantry, then north to the Office, then back to the Pantry again. Now they're in the Office again, with an exit to the south.

The problem is that they're stuck in a loop between the Pantry and Office. Every time they try to go north from the Pantry, they end up in the Office, and going south from the Office brings them back to the Pantry. So the loop is Pantry <--> Office.

The next step should be to break this loop. Since going north and south is causing the loop, maybe trying a different direction when in the Office. But the Office only has an exit to the south. Wait, in the Office, the message says there's an unguarded exit to the south, which leads back to the Pantry. So maybe the user needs to find another way out of the Office. But the Office only has a south exit. Unless there's another exit not mentioned.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east from the Pantry. But earlier, when they tried going east, they couldn't. Wait, in the Pantry, the exits are east, north, south. But when they tried going east, the game said "You can't go that way." So maybe east is blocked. But the user is in the Office now, so maybe they need to find another path.

Wait, the user is in the Office. The only exit is south to the Pantry. So if they go south again, they go back to the Pantry. But the fondue is in the Pantry. So maybe the user needs to go east from the Pantry, but that's blocked. Or maybe the user needs to pick up the fondue when they are in the Pantry. But the game might require them to be in a position where they can take it. Since the fondue is on the floor, maybe the user just needs to take it. But the game might require moving to a specific location.

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go east from the Office. But the Office only has a south exit. So perhaps the user is stuck in a loop and needs to find another way. But the only way out is south to the Pantry. So maybe the user needs to go east from the Pantry, even though it's blocked. But the game says they can't. So perhaps the correct action is to go east, even if it's blocked, to pick up the fondue. But the game might not allow that. Alternatively, the user needs to take the fondue when they are in the Pantry. So the next action is to take the fondue. But the game might require moving to a position where the fondue is accessible. So the user is already in the Pantry where the fondue is. So the next step is to take the fondue. But the game might not have a 'take' command. So maybe the user needs to go east, but that's blocked. Hmm.

Wait, the user is in the Office. The only exit is south to the Pantry. So they need to go south again to the Pantry. Then, in the Pantry, the fondue is there. So the user needs to take the fondue. But the game might require them to be in the Pantry to do that. So the next action is to go south to the Pantry, then take the fondue. But the user is already in the Pantry. So maybe the correct action is to take the fondue. But the game might not have that command. Alternatively, the user needs to go east from the Pantry, but that's blocked. So the user is stuck in a loop and needs to find another way. But the only way is to go south again. So the next action is to go south to the Pantry, then take the fondue. But the user is already there. So maybe the answer is to take the fondue. But the game might require moving to a specific location. So the next action is to go east, even though it's blocked. But the game says they can't. So the user is stuck. Therefore, the correct action is to go east, even if it's blocked, to pick up the fondue. But the game says they can't. So maybe the user needs to go east, and the game allows it. But in the previous step, when they tried going east, the game said "You can't go that way." So maybe the user needs to try a different action. But the only other option is to go north or south. But that's the loop. So the user is stuck. Therefore, the next action should be to go east, even though it's blocked, to pick up the fondue. But the game might not allow that. So the correct answer is to go east.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to recover the fondue from the pantry. They've been stuck in a loop between the Pantry and Office, moving back and forth. The key issue is that they can't escape the loop and need to find a way to get the fondue.

First, the goal is clear: get the fondue. The user is in the Pantry again, where the fondue is located. The problem is that they can't exit the Pantry to get to the fondue because the exits are blocked or lead back to the Office. The previous actions of going north and south have just brought them back to the same places.

Second, the past actions have not made progress. They've tried going east, north, and south, but it's a loop. The Office only has a south exit, which leads back to the Pantry. So the user is stuck in a cycle between the two rooms.

Third, to break the loop, the user needs to try a different action. Since going east is blocked, maybe they need to find another way. But the only exits are north, south, and east. Since east is blocked, maybe the solution is to take the fondue when they are in the Pantry. The game might require them to take the fondue directly instead of moving around.

So the next action should be to take the fondue. But the game might not have a 'take' command. Alternatively, the user needs to go east, even though it's blocked, to pick it up. But the game says they can't. Therefore, the correct action is to take the fondue when they are in the Pantry.
