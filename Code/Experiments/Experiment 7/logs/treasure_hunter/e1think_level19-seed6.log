Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, go west. With that accomplished, lift the chocolate bar from the floor of the workshop. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Kitchenette =-
You've just walked into a kitchenette.

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a cabinet. You can make out a saucepan. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

-= Workshop =-
You are in a workshop. A standard kind of place. You begin looking for stuff.



There is an unguarded exit to the east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

There is a chocolate bar and a broccoli on the floor.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text-based game where they need to follow specific steps to achieve the goal. The goal is to go west, lift the chocolate bar, and then stop.

First, the user started by going west, which took them from the kitchenette to the workshop. In the workshop, they see a chocolate bar on the floor. The next step is to pick up the chocolate bar. But the current prompt says there's a chocolate bar and broccoli on the floor. So the user needs to pick that up.

Wait, the initial instructions said after going west, lift the chocolate bar. So the user has already gone west, and now they need to pick up the chocolate. But the current location is the workshop. The user's next action should be to take the chocolate bar. However, in text adventures, you often use commands like "take chocolate bar" or "pick up chocolate bar".

But the user's previous action was "go west", which is correct. Now, they need to pick up the chocolate. The next step is to take the chocolate bar. The user might have already done that, but the game might require the exact command. So the correct next action is to take the chocolate bar. Then, once that's done, they can stop. So the answer should be "take chocolate bar".
