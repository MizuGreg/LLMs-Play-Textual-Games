Welcome to another life changing round of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First of all, try to move west. After that, try to take a trip west. With that done, make an effort to venture north. Okay, and then, make an effort to go to the east. And then, venture north. And then, make an effort to venture west. Once you manage that, head west. Then, make an attempt to go west. Once you manage that, retrieve the sandwich from the table within the kitchen. Alright, thanks!

You are in a recreation zone. It seems to be pretty standard here.

You see an opened chest. The chest is empty! What a waste of a day!

-= Closet =-
You've entered a closet.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a rack. However, the rack, like an empty rack, has nothing on it. Look over there! a workbench. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. Look over there! a counter. The counter appears to be empty. Hm. Oh well

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an unblocked exit to the west.
