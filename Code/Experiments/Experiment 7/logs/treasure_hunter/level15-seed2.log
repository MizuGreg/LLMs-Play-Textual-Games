Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an profound round of TextWorld? You do! Here is your task for today. First, it would be a great idea if you could try to move west. Next, venture south. With that over with, go to the east. And then, go to the south. If you can manage that, head west. Then, pick-up the latchkey from the floor of the studio. Once that's all handled, you can stop!
