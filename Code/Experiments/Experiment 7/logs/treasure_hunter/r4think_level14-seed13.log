You are now playing a exciting game of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First stop, head west. Then, try to move south. Once you get through with that, head east. And then, make an effort to take a trip east. Then, pick up the passkey from the floor of the bar. Got that? Good!

-= Studio =-
You find yourself in a studio. A typical one. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You make out a locked toolbox nearby. You can make out a closed bureau.

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the south. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

Look over there! a case. You look around you, at all the containers and supporters, doors and objects, and you think to yourself. Why? Why Textworld? You can see a fridge. The fridge is empty! What a waste of a day!

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let me try to figure out the next steps here. The user is in the Chamber, and the goal is to pick up the passkey from the bar's floor. So far, they've gone west to the Scullery, then south to the Chamber. The current location is the Chamber, which has a sandwich on the floor.

The next step according to the initial instructions was to head east after moving south. But the user hasn't done that yet. Wait, the initial directions said: first go west, then move south, then east, then take the passkey from the bar. But in the current scene, the user is in the Chamber. The Chamber has an exit to the north, south, and east. The sandwich is on the floor, but that's probably a red herring. The passkey is in the bar, which might be in a different area.

Wait, the user is in the Chamber. The previous steps were: Studio -> Scullery -> Chamber. The next step in the plan was to go east from the Chamber. So maybe the user needs to go east from here. But the user hasn't done that yet. The initial plan said after moving south, head east. So the next action should be to go east. But the user is in the Chamber, and the exits are north, south, east. So going east from the Chamber would be the next step. Then, after that, they need to pick up the passkey from the bar. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action is to go east. But the user might be in a loop if they keep moving between rooms without progressing. However, the current location is the Chamber, and the next step is to go east. So the correct command would be "go east".

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to pick up the passkey from the bar's floor. So far, they've moved through several rooms: Studio -> Scullery -> Chamber -> Laundromat -> Canteen -> Closet -> Chamber again. They've been moving between rooms, but haven't found the passkey yet.

Looking at the current location, they're in the Canteen. The previous steps involved moving west and east, but they've looped back to the Chamber. The passkey is supposed to be in the bar, which might be in a different area. The user needs to find the bar and pick up the passkey.

Wait, the initial instructions mentioned going east after moving south, then picking up the passkey from the bar. But the user hasn't reached the bar yet. Maybe the bar is in the Laundromat or another room. However, in the current path, they've cycled through rooms without finding it. 

The user is in the Canteen now. The exits are north and west. The next step should be to go north to check if the bar is there. Alternatively, maybe the passkey is in the Chamber, but the sandwich is on the floor. But the user needs to find the bar. Since the passkey is in the bar, they need to reach the bar's location. 

The user might be stuck in a loop between the Chamber and Laundromat. To break the loop, they need to find a different path. The next action should be to go north from the Canteen to check the next room, which might be the bar. So the command would be "go north".

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Studio again after looping through several rooms. The goal is to pick up the passkey from the bar's floor. So far, they've moved through the Scullery, Chamber, Laundromat, Canteen, Closet, and back to the Chamber and then the Studio. They haven't found the passkey yet.

In the Studio, there's a locked toolbox and a closed bureau. The exits are north, south, and west. The previous actions didn't lead to the passkey, so maybe they need to check the toolbox or bureau. But the toolbox is locked, so they might need a key. However, the passkey is supposed to be in the bar. Wait, maybe the bar is in a different location. The user hasn't checked the closed bureau yet. Maybe the passkey is there. Alternatively, they might need to find the bar through another exit.

Since the user is in the Studio, the next step could be to check the closed bureau. But the instructions say to pick up the passkey from the bar's floor. So perhaps the bar is in the Studio, and the passkey is on the floor. But the user hasn't looked around yet. They need to check the floor for the passkey. The previous steps didn't mention finding it, so maybe they need to look closer. Alternatively, they might need to use the toolbox or bureau to get access.

But the user is in a loop, moving between rooms without finding the passkey. The next action should be to check the closed bureau or the locked toolbox. However, the passkey is supposed to be in the bar. Maybe the bar is in the Studio, and the user needs to look around. Since the user is in the Studio, they should check the floor for the passkey. The command would be to look around or check the floor. But the available commands are movement. So maybe the next step is to check the closed bureau. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action is to open the bureau or check it.

So, the first step is to realize that the passkey is needed to open the toolbox. But since the toolbox is welded shut, maybe there's another way. Wait, the initial instructions said to pick up the passkey from the bar's floor. Maybe the bar is in a different room. The user has been looping between rooms without finding the bar. They need to check the exits again. The Studio has exits to north, south, and west. Maybe the bar is in one of those directions. The user should try moving east again to check the laundromat or another room. But they've already been there. Alternatively, maybe the bar is in the Studio itself, and the passkey is on the floor. The user didn't look carefully enough. They need to check the floor again. The correct action is to look around or check the floor. But the system says they can't see anything. So maybe the passkey is in the toolbox, and they need to use the correct verb. The previous attempts to use the passkey on the toolbox failed. Maybe the correct command is to open the toolbox with the passkey. But the system doesn't recognize it. So the next step is to try a different action, like checking the floor again or moving to another room.

You make out a locked toolbox nearby. You can make out an opened bureau. The bureau is empty! What a waste of a day!

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the south. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Studio again. The goal is to pick up the passkey from the bar's floor. So far, they've been moving through different rooms, but haven't found the passkey. The current location is the Studio, where there's a locked toolbox and an opened bureau. The bureau was empty before, but maybe the passkey is in the toolbox. The user tried using the passkey on the toolbox but got an error. The toolbox is welded shut, so maybe they need to find another way to open it. Alternatively, maybe the passkey is in the bar, which is in a different room. The user needs to check the exits again. The exits are north, south, and west. They've been looping between rooms, so they need to find a new path. The next step is to try opening the toolbox again, but using a different command. Maybe "open toolbox" instead of "use key on toolbox". Or check the floor again for the passkey. But the system says the bureau is empty. So the correct action is to try opening the toolbox with the passkey again, but the command might be different. The user needs to use the correct verb. The previous attempts failed, so maybe the correct command is "open toolbox" or "unlock toolbox".

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, the user is in the Cookhouse with a passkey in the chest. They've tried taking it multiple times but got errors. The goal is to pick up the passkey from the bar's floor. The passkey is in the chest, so they need to take it. The correct command is "take passkey from chest" but it's not working. Maybe the verb is "get" instead of "take". Alternatively, they might need to open the chest again. But the chest is already open. The next step is to use "get" instead of "take".

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.
