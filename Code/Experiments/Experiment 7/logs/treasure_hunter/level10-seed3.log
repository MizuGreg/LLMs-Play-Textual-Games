Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, travel north. With that accomplished, attempt to venture north. And then, make an attempt to go east. And then, head east. Then, pick up the bug from the floor of the kitchenette. Alright, thanks!

Well, here we are in a laundromat.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked.
