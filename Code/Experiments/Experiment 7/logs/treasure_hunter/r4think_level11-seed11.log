FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through these different rooms in TextWorld. The goal is to find a virtual machine and play through a life-changing round. The initial steps were going south from the sauna, then lifting the teaspoon, but that didn't work. Then they tried going west, which wasn't a verb, so they went west again, which worked. Then they went north to the kitchen.

Now, in the kitchen, there's a closed fridge, an open portal east, a gateway north, and an unguarded exit south. There's also a stick of butter on the floor. The user needs to figure out the next steps. 

First, the goal is to find a virtual machine and play through a life-changing round. The steps mentioned earlier were to go south, lift the teaspoon, then proceed. But maybe the virtual machine is in the kitchen? Or perhaps the fridge needs to be opened. The user has already lifted the teaspoon, but maybe the next step is to open the fridge. However, the user hasn't interacted with the fridge yet. The previous actions were moving through rooms, so maybe the next step is to open the fridge. But the user hasn't tried that yet. Alternatively, maybe the butter is a clue, but the main goal is to find the virtual machine. 

Wait, the initial instructions said after lifting the teaspoon, you can stop. But the user is in the kitchen now. Maybe the virtual machine is in the kitchen, so the next step is to open the fridge. But the user hasn't done that yet. Alternatively, maybe the correct path is to go north again from the kitchen, but the user is already in the kitchen. The available exits are east, north, and south. The user might need to open the fridge to find something inside. So the next action should be to open the fridge. But the user hasn't tried that yet. So the next step is to open the fridge.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in the Kitchen, having opened the fridge. The goal is to find a virtual machine and play through a life-changing round. So far, they've gone south from the sauna, lifted the teaspoon (though that was rejected earlier), then went west, north, and now to the kitchen. They opened the fridge.

First, the goal steps: Find the virtual machine, which might be in the fridge? Or maybe another room. The user needs to check the fridge contents. Since they opened the fridge, maybe there's something inside. But the previous step was opening the fridge, and the next step would be to check what's inside. However, the user hasn't examined the fridge yet. So the next action should be to look inside the fridge. But the available commands include 'examine' or 'look inside'. Wait, the commands list has 'examine ...' so maybe they need to examine the fridge. Alternatively, after opening, maybe they need to take something from it. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next step is to examine the fridge to see if there's something inside. But the user just opened it, so maybe they need to check inside. However, the previous action was 'open the fridge', and the next step is to look inside. But the user might need to use 'examine fridge' or 'look inside fridge'. But the available commands are 'examine ...', so perhaps 'examine fridge'. But the user is in the kitchen, and the fridge is there. So the next action should be to examine the fridge to find items inside. That would be the next step. But the user might have to take an item from the fridge. Alternatively, maybe the virtual machine is in the fridge. So the next action is to examine the fridge.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in the kitchen, repeatedly checking the fridge, which is empty. The goal is to find a virtual machine. So far, they've moved through sauna, cookhouse, cookery, kitchen, opened the fridge but found nothing. The next step should be to check other rooms or items. Maybe the virtual machine is elsewhere. The user needs to explore other exits. The kitchen has east, north, south exits. They came from the north, so maybe go south back to cookhouse? Or east to cookery? Or north again? Wait, the user is in the kitchen. The previous steps were going north to get here. Maybe they need to check other rooms. Alternatively, maybe the virtual machine is in the cookhouse or another area.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to find a virtual machine in this TextWorld game. So far, they've moved through several rooms: sauna, cookhouse, cookery, kitchen, office. In the kitchen, they checked the fridge but it was empty. Then they went to the office and tried to open a trunk, but it's welded shut. The goal is to find the virtual machine and play through a life-changing round.

First, the goal steps: Find the virtual machine. The user has explored several rooms but hasn't found it yet. The trunk in the office is locked and welded, so maybe that's not the right path. The fridge in the kitchen was empty. Maybe the virtual machine is in another room or perhaps they need to find a key or another item to open something.

Past actions: They've checked the fridge, tried opening the trunk, which didn't work. The next step might be to look for another way into the office or check other rooms. The office has an unguarded exit to the east and a gateway south. Maybe they should try going east or north from the office. Alternatively, maybe the trunk can't be opened, so they need to find another container or use the butter from the kitchen? Wait, there was a stick of butter on the floor in the kitchen. Maybe that's a clue, but how?

The user is in the office now. The trunk is welded, so maybe they need a tool to open it. The butter is in the kitchen. Maybe the butter can be used to unlock the trunk? Or perhaps the virtual machine is in another room. The user needs to explore more areas. The next step should be to try going east or north from the office. Since the trunk is locked, maybe the virtual machine is elsewhere. So the next action is to go east or north. The command would be "go east" or "go north". Since the user tried "go north" before and came back to the kitchen, maybe "go east" is the next step.

You are in an office. A typical one. Let's see what's in here.

You can see a locked trunk. A locked ordinary looking display is nearby.

There is an open gateway leading south. There is an unguarded exit to the east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north.

SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, the user is stuck again. They've tried opening the trunk but it's welded shut. The goal is to find the virtual machine. So far, they've checked multiple rooms but haven't found it. The next step should be to look for another way in or out. The office has an unguarded exit to the east and a gateway south. Maybe going east or north would help. Since the trunk is locked, maybe the virtual machine is elsewhere. The user needs to explore more areas. The command should be to go east or north. Let's choose "go east" since that's an unguarded exit.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Office and Attic. They've tried going north and south multiple times. The goal is to find the virtual machine. So far, they've checked several rooms but haven't found it. The trunk is locked and welded, the fridge and toolbox are empty. Maybe the virtual machine is in a different room or requires a different approach. The next step should be to look for another exit or check the display in the office. The command should be to examine the display or try opening it. Since the display is locked, maybe "examine display" or "open display".

You are in an office. A typical one. Let's see what's in here.

You can see a locked trunk. A locked ordinary looking display is nearby.

There is an open gateway leading south. There is an unguarded exit to the east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north.

-= Attic =-
You've just shown up in an attic.

You scan the room, seeing a shelf. The shelf is normal. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You see a workbench. The workbench is standard. But there isn't a thing on it.

There is an unblocked exit to the south.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.
