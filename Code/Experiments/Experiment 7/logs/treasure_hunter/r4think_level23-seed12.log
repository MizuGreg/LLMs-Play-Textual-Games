Welcome to TextWorld! First of all, you could, like, make an effort to travel east. Then, travel east. And then, make an attempt to travel east. Then, make an attempt to take a trip south. Okay, and then, venture south. Then, try to take a trip west. If you can do that, retrieve the desktop computer from the floor of the austere workshop. Got that? Good!

-= Playroom =-
You're now in a playroom. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."

You can see a closed locker. You can see a portmanteau. The portmanteau is empty, what a horrible day!

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

You find yourself in a cubicle. A silent kind of place.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

Well, here we are in the cookhouse.

What's that over there? It looks like it's a board. The board is normal. The board appears to be empty. You think about smashing the board to bits, throwing the bits into a pit, etc, until you get bored.

There is an open passageway leading east. There is an open portal leading north. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text-based game called TextWorld, and their goal is to retrieve the desktop computer from the austere workshop. The current location is the Vault, with exits south, west, and east.

First, I need to recall the steps mentioned in the initial instructions. The user was told to go east, then east again, then try to go south, then south again, then west. But they've already gone east three times, ending up in the Vault. Now, from the Vault, the exits are south, west, and east. The next step according to the initial plan was to go south, but maybe that's not working. Wait, the user's previous actions were: go east (Playroom -> Silent Cubicle -> Cookhouse -> Vault). Now, in the Vault, the exits are south, west, and east. The initial plan said after going east three times, try to go south. But the user is now in the Vault, so maybe the next step is to go south from here. However, the user might be in a loop if going south leads back to a previous area. Alternatively, maybe the desktop computer is in the Vault, but the user needs to check the room for it. But the description of the Vault doesn't mention the computer. The initial goal was to get to the workshop's floor, so perhaps the next step is to go south from the Vault. Let me check the previous steps again. The user's path is Playroom -> Silent Cubicle -> Cookhouse -> Vault. The next step should be to go south from the Vault. But if that leads back to the Cookhouse or another area, maybe they need to try a different direction. Alternatively, maybe the desktop is in the Vault, but the user hasn't checked the room. However, the initial instructions said to go east three times, then south, then west. So from the Vault, going south would be the next step. But the user might be stuck in a loop. Alternatively, maybe the correct path is to go west from the Vault. Let me think: the Vault has a west exit. If the user goes west from the Vault, they might reach the Cookhouse again. But the initial plan was to go south after three easterly moves. So perhaps the next step is to go south from the Vault. But the user needs to make sure they're not looping. If going south leads back to the Cookhouse, then maybe they need to try a different direction. However, the initial plan was to go south after three easterly moves. So the next step is to go south from the Vault. The user's next action should be 'go south'.

-= Closet =-
You've just shown up in a closet.



There is an open door leading north. There is an open gateway leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

You arrive in a workshop. An ordinary one.

You can see a locked toolbox.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

-= Austere Workshop =-
You find yourself in a workshop. An austere one.

You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a coffer.

There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

There is a desktop computer on the floor.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to get the desktop computer from the austere workshop. They've already reached the Austere Workshop, where the desktop computer is on the floor. The previous action was trying to open coffers, which didn't work. So the goal is to retrieve the computer.

Looking at the current room description: the user is in the Austere Workshop, there's a coffer and the desktop computer is on the floor. The exits are east and north. The user needs to pick up the computer. Since the computer is already on the floor, maybe they just need to pick it up. But the game might require interacting with the coffer first. However, the user tried to open the coffers but couldn't. Maybe the coffer is locked, and they need a key. But where is the key? Alternatively, maybe the desktop computer is already there, and the user just needs to take it. The previous action of opening the coffer failed, so perhaps the correct action is to take the desktop computer directly. The user hasn't picked it up yet, so the next step is to take it. The command would be 'take desktop computer' or something similar. But in the game's context, maybe the correct command is 'get desktop computer' or 'take desktop computer'. Since the user is in the room where the computer is, the next action should be to take it. The previous steps led them here, so the final step is to pick up the computer.
