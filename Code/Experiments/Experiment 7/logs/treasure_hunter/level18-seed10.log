It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! First stop, try to go to the west. Following that, make an effort to venture north. Next, venture east. Then, doublecheck that the portal is open. After that, make an effort to go to the north. Then, make absolutely sure that the gate inside the kitchenette is opened. After that, take a trip east. And then, pick-up the stick of butter from the floor of the cubicle. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Chamber =-
You are in a chamber.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

-= Basement =-
You've entered a basement. Let's see what's in here.

Hey, want to see a counter? Look over there, a counter. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it.

There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Bedchamber =-
You are in a bedchamber. A normal one.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Spare Room =-
You arrive in a spare room. A standard kind of place.

You make out a toolbox. The toolbox is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a coffer. Oh, great. Here's a display. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. This always happens!

There is a closed portal leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

There is a passkey on the floor.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is stuck in the Spare Room, trying to check the portal north but keeps getting told they only understood checking the portal. The goal was to go west, north, east, check the portal, then go north again, open the kitchenette gate, go east, and pick up the butter.

So far, they've gone west, north, east, and now are in the Spare Room. They tried checking the portal north but it's not working. Maybe the portal isn't open yet. The next step was to go north again, but the user is stuck trying to check the portal. Maybe they need to find another way to open the portal or use the passkey on the floor. The passkey might be needed to open the portal. So instead of checking the portal, they should pick up the passkey first. Then use it to open the portal. That would make sense. So the next action should be to pick up the passkey.
</think>pick up passkey
