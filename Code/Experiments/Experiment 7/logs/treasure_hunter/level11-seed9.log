Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an exciting round of TextWorld? You do! Here is how to play! First thing I need you to do is to make an attempt to venture north. Then, pick-up the poem from the floor of the bedchamber. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Spare Room =-
You are in a spare room. A typical one.

You can make out an opened ordinary looking cabinet in the corner. The cabinet is empty, what a horrible day!

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Bedchamber =-
You find yourself in a bedchamber. An usual kind of place.



There is an unblocked exit to the east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

There is a poem on the floor.
