Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an fast paced round of TextWorld? You do! First step, head east. Okay, and then, go north. Once you accomplish that, take a trip east. Once you finish that, try to go south. Once you accomplish that, head south. After that, make an effort to travel south. With that done, recover the mop from the floor of the laundry place. Got that? Good!

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in a text-based game. The goal is to recover the mop from the laundry place. Let me recap the steps they've taken so far.

First, they started in the Laundromat, went east to the Bedroom, then north to the Cubicle, south back to the Bedroom. Now they're back in the Bedroom again. The initial instructions said to go east, north, then east again, south, then south again, and finally get the mop. But the user is stuck in a loop between the Bedroom and Cubicle.

So the next step should be to check if there's a way to proceed from the Bedroom. The Bedroom has a chest mentioned. Maybe the chest contains something useful. The user hasn't interacted with the chest yet. The previous actions were moving around, but not exploring objects. The mop is in the laundry place, which is the Laundromat. But the user is currently in the Bedroom. So perhaps they need to go back to the Laundromat via the west portal, then find the mop. But the Laundromat's description mentioned a table with nothing and a portal east, gate south, passageway west. Wait, the user is in the Bedroom, which has a portal west leading back to the Laundromat. So the next step should be to go west from the Bedroom to the Laundromat again, then check the table or other areas for the mop. But the initial instruction said to recover the mop from the laundry place. Maybe the mop is in the Laundromat's table or somewhere else. The user needs to check the Laundromat again. But the current position is the Bedroom, so going west is the way back. Then, in the Laundromat, maybe the mop is on the floor. The user needs to pick it up. So the next action is to go west from the Bedroom to the Laundromat, then check the floor for the mop.

Ah, the laundromat. This is some kind of laundromat, really great normal vibes in this place, a wonderful normal atmosphere. And now, well, you're in it.

You make out a table. The table is ordinary. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is an open portal leading east. There is an open gate leading south. There is an open passageway leading west.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to recover the mop from the laundry place. So far, they've navigated through the Laundromat, Bedroom, Cubicle, and back to the Laundromat. They checked the table and under the table but found nothing. The mop must be somewhere else in the Laundromat that they haven't checked yet. Maybe they missed a different location. The previous actions were repetitive, checking the same spots. To break the loop, they need to explore other areas in the Laundromat. The open portal east, gate south, or passageway west might lead to places where the mop is. The next step should be to check those directions instead of rechecking the table.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to find the mop in the laundromat. They've been moving through different rooms: Laundromat, Bedroom, Cubicle, back to Laundromat, then to the Cellar, Office, and now the Shower. The mop hasn't been found yet. The previous steps involved checking the table and under the table in the Laundromat, which didn't work. Now, in the Shower, the options are east, north, or south. The user needs to find the mop, which is supposed to be in the laundry place. Maybe they missed a location earlier. The Shower is a new area, so perhaps the mop is here or leading to another room. Since the user is in the Shower, the next step should be to check south, as the prompt suggests. But they need to make sure they're not looping. The previous actions didn't find the mop, so maybe they need to check other areas or use a different approach. The next action should be to go south from the Shower.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Office and Cellar. They've been going back and forth between these rooms without making progress. The goal is to find the mop in the laundromat. So far, they checked the Laundromat's table and under the table but didn't find anything. Now they're in the Cellar again, which they've already been in before. The previous actions didn't lead to the mop, so maybe they need to try a different approach. Instead of just moving east and west, they should check other areas or look for objects that might be related to the mop. Maybe the secret button in the Cellar is part of the solution. Alternatively, they might need to go back to the Laundromat again and check different locations. Since the user is in the Cellar, perhaps they should try going north instead of west to escape the loop and find a new path to the Laundromat.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to pick up the mop from the chest in the Bedroom. They tried "take the mop" and "pick up the mop", but the game didn't recognize those. The correct action here is probably "get the mop" or "take the mop" again. But since the game says "You can't see any such thing," maybe the mop is already in hand, and the next step is to exit or go back to the laundromat. Wait, the goal was to recover the mop from the laundry place, which is the Laundromat. The user is in the Bedroom now, so they need to go back to the Laundromat. The previous steps involved moving through different rooms, so the next action should be to go west back to the Laundromat.

Ah, the laundromat. This is some kind of laundromat, really great normal vibes in this place, a wonderful normal atmosphere. And now, well, you're in it.

You make out a table. The table is ordinary. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is an open portal leading east. There is an open gate leading south. There is an open passageway leading west.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Laundromat, Cellar, and Office. They've been moving back and forth without finding the mop. The goal is to recover the mop from the laundromat. Earlier, they found the mop in the Bedroom but couldn't pick it up. Now, they need to go back to the Laundromat and check again. The previous actions didn't work, so maybe they need to try a different approach. The next step should be to check the table again or look for the mop in another location. Since the user is in the Laundromat again, they should look around carefully.

THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.

-= Laundromat =-
Ah, the laundromat. This is some kind of laundromat, really great normal vibes in this place, a wonderful normal atmosphere. And now, well, you're in it.

You make out a table. The table is ordinary. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is an open portal leading east. There is an open gate leading south. There is an open passageway leading west.

SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

-= Shower =-
You find yourself in a shower. An usual one.



There is an open passageway leading east. There is an unblocked exit to the north. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

Ah, the cellar. This is some kind of cellar, really great ordinary vibes in this place, a wonderful ordinary atmosphere. The room is well lit.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

There is an open gate leading north. There is an open hatch leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

Ah, the laundromat. This is some kind of laundromat, really great normal vibes in this place, a wonderful normal atmosphere. And now, well, you're in it.

You make out a table. The table is ordinary. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is an open portal leading east. There is an open gate leading south. There is an open passageway leading west.
