Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First off, try to take a trip west. If you can do that, make an attempt to go to the south. And then, go to the south. If you can manage that, head east. Then, move south. And then, head west. With that done, retrieve the latchkey from the floor of the studio. And if you do that, you're the winner!

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to win this game. The user's goal is to navigate through the cubicle and sauna, moving west, south, east, south again, then retrieve the latchkey from the studio's floor.

Looking at the history, the player keeps alternating between the cubicle and sauna by going west and east. Each time they try to go west, they end up back in the cubicle, and east takes them to the sauna. But the problem is that the directions are looping without progress. The user mentioned that after moving west, they need to go south, but in the sauna, there's a portal leading south. However, the player keeps getting stuck in the loop between the two rooms.

So the next step should be to try going south from the sauna, as there's an open portal mentioned. But the previous attempts to go south didn't work because the player was stuck in the loop. Maybe the key is to go south once from the sauna, then proceed further. Alternatively, maybe the player needs to find another way to get out of the loop. Since the cubicle and sauna are repeatedly being visited, perhaps the correct path is to go south from the sauna, then continue moving east or west as needed to reach the studio. But the user's instructions say to go west, south, east, south, then retrieve the latchkey. So maybe after getting to the studio, the latchkey is on the floor. But the current loop is preventing progress. The next action should be to go south from the sauna, which is the first step in the plan. But the player has been stuck in the loop, so maybe using a different verb or synonym, like "move south" instead of "go south" to break the loop. However, the game might not accept synonyms. Alternatively, since the sauna has a portal south, the player should go south there. The next command should be "go south" from the sauna.
