Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an fast paced round of TextWorld? You do! Here is how to play! First step, go to the north. With that over with, make an attempt to take a trip north. And then, make an attempt to travel east. Then, travel south. After that, take a trip east. Then, make an effort to go to the south. With that accomplished, make an attempt to go west. If you can get through with that, recover the worm from the floor of the kitchenette. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Shower =-
You are in a shower. A typical kind of place.

You can see a closed dresser in the room. You can make out a basket. You can see a bench. The bench is ordinary. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a rack. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The rack is typical. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is playing a text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and recover a worm from the kitchenette. The initial steps mentioned in the prompt are to go north, then east, south, east again, south, west, and finally recover the worm.

Looking at the current environment, the user is in the basement. The previous action was "go north" from the shower to the basement. The next steps according to the prompt are to travel east, then south, then east again, then south, then west. But the user is now in the basement, so the next logical step would be to go east as per the initial instructions.

Wait, the user's current location is the basement. The available exits are east, north, and south. The prompt says after going north, then east, south, etc. So after the first north to the basement, the next step is to go east. The user hasn't done that yet. So the next action should be "go east" from the basement. But I need to check if that's the correct sequence. The original instructions say: go north (done), then east, then south, then east, then south, then west. So after basement, go east. Then from there, maybe another room. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next step is to go east from the basement. But the user's last action was going north, so the next step is east. Therefore, the next command should be "go east".

You're now in a bedroom. You begin looking for stuff.

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a box. You shudder, but continue examining the room.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the north. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through a text-based game. The goal is to recover the worm from the kitchenette floor and win. The instructions mention a specific sequence of movements: go north, then east, south, east again, south, west. But the user is currently in the Bedroom.

First, I need to recall the game's objective. The user has to follow the path: north, east, south, east, south, west, then get the worm. So far, the user has gone from the Shower to the Basement (north), then to the Bedroom (east). The next step in the original plan was to go south from the Bedroom. But the user might be stuck in a loop if they keep going back and forth.

Looking at the current room (Bedroom), the exits are east, north, and west. The original plan after the Bedroom would be to go south, but the user might have already tried that. Wait, the user's previous action was going east from the Basement to the Bedroom. Now, the next step according to the original plan was to go south from the Bedroom. But the user hasn't done that yet. However, the user might be facing a loop if they keep moving between rooms without progress. 

But in the current room (Bedroom), the user can go north, east, or west. The original plan after the Bedroom is to go south, but the user might not have that exit yet. Wait, the original instructions said after going east from the Basement (which is the second step), then travel south. But in the Bedroom, the user can go south? Let me check the previous steps.

Wait, the initial steps were: go north (from Shower to Basement), then east (Basement to Bedroom). Then the next step was to travel south. But in the Bedroom, the user can go south? The description says in the Bedroom: "You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the north. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west." So south isn't mentioned as an exit here. That's a problem. So maybe the user is stuck because the next step (south) isn't available from the Bedroom. 

Wait, the original plan was after going east from the Basement (step 2), then travel south (step 3). But in the Bedroom, the user can't go south. So maybe the user needs to find another way. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the path. Maybe after the Bedroom, they need to go west instead of south. But according to the original plan, the steps are: north, east, south, east, south, west. So after the Bedroom (which is after east from Basement), the next step is south. But if south isn't available, then perhaps the user needs to find another route. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is in a loop between the Basement and Bedroom. So the user needs to try a different direction. The user's previous action was going east from the Basement to the Bedroom. Now, in the Bedroom, the options are north, east, west. The original plan was to go south, but that's not possible. So maybe the user needs to go west from the Bedroom instead. But according to the original plan, after the Bedroom, the next step is south. But if that's not possible, maybe the user needs to adjust the path. 

Wait, the user's goal is to get to the kitchenette floor. Maybe the correct path is to go from the Bedroom west to the Basement, then north to the Shower, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east from the Bedroom again. But that would be going back to the Basement. 

This is confusing. The user's next action should be to go south from the Bedroom, but if that's not possible, maybe the user needs to try a different direction. However, the game's description for the Bedroom doesn't mention a south exit. So perhaps the user is stuck. But according to the original plan, the user should go south from the Bedroom. Maybe the user made a mistake in the path. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to find another way. 

But the user's next action should be to go south, even if it's not listed. Maybe the game allows that. Alternatively, the user might have to use a synonym. But the user's previous action was going east, so maybe the next step is to go west. But that's not part of the original plan. 

Wait, the original plan says after going east from the Basement (step 2), then travel south (step 3). But in the Bedroom, the user can't go south. So perhaps the user needs to go west from the Bedroom to the Basement, then north to the Shower, then east to the Basement again, but that seems like a loop. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east again from the Bedroom to the next room. But the original plan says after the Bedroom, go south. So perhaps the user is in a loop and needs to try a different direction. The user's previous action was east, so maybe the next step is to go west. But that's not part of the original plan. However, the user's goal is to break the loop. So the user needs to try a different action. 

In this case, the user is in the Bedroom. The original plan says to go south, but that's not possible. So the user needs to try a different direction. The user's next action should be to go west, which is available. But according to the original plan, after the Bedroom, the next step is south. But since that's not possible, the user needs to adjust. So the next action is to go west. But that's not part of the original steps. However, the user's goal is to break the loop. Therefore, the next action is to go west.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through a text-based game. The goal is to recover the worm from the kitchenette and win. The current location is the basement again after going west from the bedroom.

First, I need to recap the game's objective. The user has to go north, then east, south, east again, south, and west to get to the kitchenette. But so far, the user has gone north from the shower, then east to the bedroom, then west back to the basement. They're stuck in a loop between the basement and bedroom.

Looking at the steps taken: they've done go north (shower to basement), then go east (basement to bedroom), then go west (bedroom to basement). Now they're back in the basement. The next step should be to go east again to leave the basement. But the user might be repeating the same actions, leading to a loop. So the next action should be to go east from the basement to proceed further. However, the game's instructions mention that after getting to the kitchenette, they need to recover the worm. But the current path might not be leading them there yet. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to find another way. But according to the initial directions, after going west, they should proceed to the kitchenette. Wait, the initial instructions said: after going west, if they can get through, recover the worm. So maybe the basement is part of the path. But the user is stuck in a loop between basement and bedroom. So the next step is to go east again from the basement to proceed. But the user has already done that. Wait, the previous steps were: shower -> basement -> bedroom -> basement. Now, the next step should be to go east again from the basement to go to the bedroom again? But that's the same as before. Hmm, maybe the user needs to go north from the basement to exit. Wait, the basement has an exit to the north. So maybe the next step is to go north from the basement to leave and proceed further. But the initial plan was to go north, east, south, east, south, west. So perhaps the user needs to go north from the basement to exit and continue. But the user is in the basement again. So the next action should be to go north to exit the basement. But the user might be repeating actions. Alternatively, maybe the correct path is to go east from the basement to the bedroom again, but that's not helping. Wait, the initial plan was to go north, then east, then south, then east, then south, then west. So after the first north to basement, then east to bedroom, then south back to basement, then east to bedroom again? That doesn't make sense. Maybe the user is supposed to go north from the basement to exit. But the basement has an exit to the north. So maybe the next step is to go north from the basement to exit. But the user is in the basement again. So the next action is go north. But the user has already done that. Wait, the initial steps were: go north (shower to basement), then go east (basement to bedroom), then go west (bedroom to basement). Now, the user is back in the basement. The next step should be to go east again to go to the bedroom, but that's the same as before. So maybe the user is stuck in a loop between basement and bedroom. Therefore, the next action should be to go north from the basement to exit. But the user needs to follow the initial steps: after going west, they need to recover the worm. But the current location is the basement. Maybe the user needs to go north from the basement to exit and proceed to the next area. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east from the basement to the bedroom again, but that's not helping. Wait, the initial instructions said after going west, if they can get through, recover the worm. So maybe the user is in the basement, and needs to go north to exit. So the next action is go north.

So far, they've moved from the shower to the basement, then to the bedroom, back to the basement, and then to the playroom, and back to the basement again.

Looking at the steps mentioned in the initial instruction, the user needs to go north, then east, south, east, south, west, and then retrieve the worm. But in the current state, they're in the basement again after going south from the playroom. The previous actions have them looping between the basement and playroom. 

The problem here is that the user is stuck in a loop between the basement and playroom. The next step should be to break this loop. Instead of repeating the same actions, they need to find a different direction. The playroom has an east exit, and the basement has an east exit. Maybe trying east from the playroom would lead them somewhere new. Alternatively, from the basement, maybe going north or south again, but the user has already tried those. 

Wait, the initial instructions said after going south, then east, then south, then west. But the user has been moving between basement and playroom. Maybe they need to go east from the playroom. Let me check the playroom description again. The playroom has an east exit and a south exit. The user was in the playroom and went south to the basement. Now, they need to try east from the playroom to avoid the loop. So the next action should be going east from the playroom. But the user is currently in the basement. Wait, no, the last move was south from the playroom to the basement. So the current location is the basement. The basement has an east exit. So maybe the next step is to go east from the basement. But the user has been going back and forth. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go north from the basement to the playroom again, then east. But that's the same as before. The key is to find a new path. The worm is in the kitchenette, so maybe the user needs to find the kitchenette. But how? The initial steps mentioned going through north, east, south, etc. Maybe the correct path is to go north from the shower, then east to the bedroom, then west back to basement, then north to playroom, then east to somewhere else. But the user is stuck in a loop. 

The user needs to break the loop. Since they are in the basement, maybe trying a different direction. The basement has an east exit. Let's check the basement description again. The basement has an exit to the north and south. Wait, the user is in the basement, and the previous steps were going south from the playroom. So the next step is to go east from the basement. But the user has already done that before. Maybe the user needs to go north from the basement to the playroom again, then east. But that's the same as before. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east from the playroom. But the user is in the basement. Wait, the last action was going south from the playroom to the basement. So the current location is the basement. The basement has an east exit. So the next action should be go east. But the user has already done that. However, maybe the user needs to try a different action. Since the previous actions have not led to progress, the user needs to try a different command. But the available directions are east, north, south. The user has tried all of them. 

Wait, the initial goal was to go north, then east, south, east, south, west, then retrieve the worm. The user has done north (shower to basement), then east (basement to bedroom), then west (bedroom to basement), then north (basement to playroom), then south (playroom to basement). So the next step according to the initial plan would be east from the basement. But that's where they are now. So maybe the user needs to go east from the basement. But that's the same as before. However, maybe the user needs to go north from the basement to the playroom again, then east. But that's the same loop. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go south from the basement. But the basement's south exit is unguarded. So going south from the basement would take them to another room. But the user hasn't explored that yet. Wait, in the basement description, there's an exit to the south. So maybe going south from the basement would lead to a new room. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next step should be to go south from the basement. That would break the loop and take them to a new area. 

But according to the initial plan, after going south, then east, then south, then west. But the user is now in the basement again. So maybe the next step is to go south from the basement. That would be a new direction. So the answer is go south.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Shower room again after moving south from the Basement. The previous steps have led them in a loop between the Shower, Basement, and Playroom. The challenge is to break this loop and proceed towards the kitchenette.

The next step according to the initial plan was to go west from the Bedroom, but that led back to the Basement. Now, in the Shower, the available exits are east, north, and south. The user has already tried going north and south, which loop back. The key is to find a different path. Maybe instead of repeating south, they should try east again. But the initial plan said after going west, they should go south. However, since that's leading to a loop, perhaps they need to find another way. Wait, the original plan was to go north, east, south, east, south, west. But in the current state, they're back in the Shower. Maybe they need to go east from the Shower to the Playroom again, then find another exit. Alternatively, maybe the worm is in the kitchenette, which is accessible through a different path. But the user hasn't found the kitchenette yet. The problem is that the current path is looping, so they need to find a new direction. The next action should be to go east from the Shower to the Playroom again, then proceed further. But the user has to follow the initial steps strictly. Alternatively, maybe they need to go north from the Shower to the Basement again, but that's already been done. Hmm. The user needs to break the loop by trying a different action. Since the previous actions of going south and north are leading back, maybe the next step is to go east again from the Shower. But the initial plan said after the first north, then east, then south, etc. So perhaps the correct next step is to go east from the Shower to the Playroom, then proceed as per the plan. But the user is in the Shower again, so the next command should be go east.
</think>go east

-= Kitchenette =-
A well framed board tells you that you are now in the kitchenette.

You smell a sickening smell, and follow it to a saucepan. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

There is a worm on the floor.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in a text-based game. The goal is to recover the worm from the floor of the kitchenette and then win. Let me recap the steps they've taken so far.

Starting from the shower, they went north to the basement, then east to the bedroom, west back to the basement, north again to the playroom, south back to the basement, and then east to the kitchenette. Now, in the kitchenette, they see a worm on the floor. The next step according to the initial instructions was to recover the worm from the floor of the kitchenette. 

Looking at the current room description, the user is in the kitchenette, and there's a worm on the floor. The previous actions have led them here. The next logical step would be to pick up the worm. But the game might require a specific command like "take worm" or "get worm". However, the user's previous actions have been moving between rooms, so maybe they need to interact with the worm directly.

Wait, the instruction says "recover the worm from the floor of the kitchenette". So the correct action here is to take the worm. The user hasn't done that yet. The previous steps were moving around, but now they're in the kitchenette, so the next command should be to take the worm. Let me check the available commands in the kitchenette description. The user can go east or west, but the worm is on the floor. So the correct action is to take the worm. The answer should be "take worm".
