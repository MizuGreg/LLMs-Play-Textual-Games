Welcome to another life changing round of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First thing I need you to do is to try to travel east. And then, travel east. With that done, open the hatch. And then, attempt to take a trip east. Following that, go to the north. Then, move west. After that, make an attempt to travel west. And then, make an attempt to venture north. Okay, and then, recover the loaf of bread from the counter inside the pantry. And once you've done that, you win!

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text-based game where they need to follow a series of steps to win. The goal is to travel east, then east again, open the hatch, take a trip east, go north, move west, attempt west again, venture north, recover bread from the pantry, and then win.

Looking at the current state: The user is in the Chamber. They've already opened the hatch. The next steps according to the initial instructions are to attempt to travel east again, then go north, move west, etc. But the user's last action was opening the hatch, which was step 3. Now, the next step should be to go east again, but the hatch is already open. Wait, the user is in the Chamber, which has a closed hatch leading east. They just opened it, so maybe they need to go through it. But the current prompt shows that after opening the hatch, the next step is to attempt to travel east. However, the user might be stuck in a loop if they keep going east without progressing. Alternatively, maybe after opening the hatch, they need to go through it to proceed. But the game's current state shows that the hatch is open, so the next action should be to go east through the hatch. But the user's previous actions were go east, go east, open hatch. Now, the next step is to take a trip east (maybe go east again), then go north, move west, etc. But the user might be in a loop if they keep going east without making progress. So the next action should be to go east again, but if that's not working, maybe use a synonym like 'move east' or 'travel east'. However, the user's last action was opening the hatch, so the next step is to go east through the hatch. But the current location is the Chamber, which has an exit to the north. Maybe the user needs to go north first. Wait, the initial instructions say after opening the hatch, attempt to take a trip east. So maybe after opening the hatch, the user should go east again. But the hatch is already open, so perhaps the next step is to go east. However, the user might be in a loop if they keep going east. So the next action should be to go east again, but if that's not working, maybe try a different direction. But according to the instructions, after opening the hatch, the next step is to attempt to take a trip east. So the correct next action is 'go east'.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to win the game by following a specific sequence of actions. The goal is to travel east, then east again, open the hatch, take a trip east, go north, move west, attempt west again, venture north, recover the bread from the pantry, and then win.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Lounge. Previous actions include going east from the Bar, then East again to the Chamber, opening the hatch, going east to the Studio, then North to the Washroom, West to the Salon, North to the Bedchamber, and East to the Lounge. Now, the next step according to the initial instructions was to attempt to travel west after going north. But in the current location (Lounge), the user needs to move west. However, the user's last action was going east, so maybe they need to go west now. But the instructions say after going north, move west, then attempt west again, then venture north. So from the Lounge, the user should go west. But the Lounge has an exit to the south and west. The user needs to move west to continue the sequence. However, the user might be in a loop if they keep moving between rooms without progressing towards the pantry. But according to the steps, after the initial easts and opening the hatch, the next steps are go north, move west, attempt west, venture north, then get the bread. So from the Lounge, going west would take them to the previous room, maybe the Bedchamber again. But the user needs to get to the pantry. Maybe the bread is in the Salon or another room. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go north from the Lounge to reach the next area. Wait, the Lounge has an exit to the north. But the initial instructions say after going north, move west. So perhaps the user needs to go north from the Lounge. But the user is currently in the Lounge, and the next step is to go west as per the instructions. However, the user might be stuck in a loop between rooms. So the correct next action is to go west, but if that's not working, maybe try a synonym like 'move west' or 'travel west'. But the user's last action was 'go east', so the next step should be 'go west' to follow the sequence. Therefore, the next command is 'go west'.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in the Salon, which is part of the game's environment. The goal is to follow a specific sequence of actions to reach the pantry and recover the bread.

First, the goal steps are: travel east, then east again, open the hatch, take a trip east, go north, move west, attempt west again, venture north, then get the bread. So far, the user has gone through several rooms: Bar → Playroom → Chamber → Studio → Washroom → Salon → Bedchamber → Lounge → Salon again. They're currently in the Salon, which is step 7 or 8 of the process.

The next step according to the initial instructions is to venture north after attempting west. But in the Salon, there's an exit to the north. However, the user might be stuck in a loop between the Salon and Bedchamber. The user needs to move north from the Salon to proceed. But the current location is Salon, and the next step is to go north. However, the user's previous action was going south, which brought them back to the Salon. So the next action should be to go north from the Salon. But the user might be repeating steps, so maybe they need to use a different command like 'move north' instead of 'go north'. But the game might accept 'go north' as the correct command. Therefore, the next action is 'go north'.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Bedchamber and Salon. The goal is to recover the bread from the pantry. So far, the user has followed the initial steps: went east, opened the hatch, went north, moved west, etc., but seems to be cycling between rooms without progressing towards the pantry.

The next step according to the initial instructions was to venture north after attempting west. But the user is repeatedly going between the Salon and Bedchamber. Maybe they need to find another way to get to the pantry. The pantry isn't mentioned in the current rooms, but the user needs to reach it. Perhaps the bread is in the Salon's locker or chest, but they're locked. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east from the Salon to the next area. Since the Salon has an unblocked exit to the east, maybe that's the way to go. The user has been going back and forth, so the next action should be to go east from the Salon to proceed further.

THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in the Salon again, stuck in a loop between the Salon, Lounge, and Bedchamber. The goal is to recover the bread from the pantry. So far, the user has followed the initial steps but is cycling between rooms without progressing. The next step should be to go east from the Salon, as that's the unblocked exit mentioned. The user needs to break the loop by moving east to proceed further towards the pantry. The previous actions of going west and south aren't helping, so changing direction to east might be the key. Therefore, the next action is 'go east'.

You've just shown up in a washroom. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You smell an intriguing smell, and follow it to a safe. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a drawer. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this?

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

You've just shown up in a washroom. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You smell an intriguing smell, and follow it to a safe. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a drawer. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this?

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

Guess what, you are in the place we're calling the salon. Let's see what's in here.

There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.
