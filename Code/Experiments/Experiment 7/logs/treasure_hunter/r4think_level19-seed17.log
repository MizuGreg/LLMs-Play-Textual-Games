Welcome to another fast paced episode of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First step, doublecheck that the gateway in the bathroom is wide open. After that, attempt to take a trip west. After that, open the hatch in the kitchen. Then, make an effort to go west. With that over with, open the portal in the office. And then, attempt to venture north.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in the bathroom, trying to open the gateway west but keeps getting told they need to open it first. They tried going west but it's closed. The goal is to follow a series of steps: open the bathroom gateway, go west, open the kitchen hatch, go west again, open the office portal, go north, open the attic door, go north again, and retrieve the potato from the salon.

So far, the user tried opening the gateway west, but maybe the command wasn't recognized. The system says they need to open it first, then go west. But the user tried going west without opening, so the system is pointing out that the gateway is closed. The user is in a loop because they keep trying to go west without opening the gateway. The next step is to make sure the gateway is opened. The correct action is to open the gateway west again, but maybe the system is expecting a different phrasing. Alternatively, maybe "open the west gateway" or "open the gateway to the west". But the user's previous attempt was "open gateway west", which might not be the correct syntax. The system might be expecting "open the west gateway" or similar. So the next action should be to open the west gateway properly, then go west.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is stuck in the bathroom, trying to open the west gateway. The system keeps saying they need to open it first before going west. The user tried "open gateway west" and "go west", but it's not working. The goal is to follow a sequence: open bathroom gateway, go west, open kitchen hatch, go west, open office portal, go north, open attic door, go north, retrieve potato.

So far, the user hasn't successfully opened the gateway. The previous attempts were to open the gateway and then go west, but the system is rejecting the "go west" until the gateway is open. The user is in a loop because they keep trying to go west without opening the gateway. The problem is that the command "open gateway west" might not be the correct syntax. The system might expect "open the west gateway" or "open the gateway to the west". Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "open west gateway".

The next step is to try a different phrasing for opening the gateway. Instead of "open gateway west", try "open the west gateway". That might be the correct command. Then, after opening it, go west. If that doesn't work, maybe the system is expecting a different action, like "unlock the gateway" or "push the gateway". But since the user is stuck, the key is to find the right command to open the gateway. The next action should be to open the west gateway using the correct phrasing.
