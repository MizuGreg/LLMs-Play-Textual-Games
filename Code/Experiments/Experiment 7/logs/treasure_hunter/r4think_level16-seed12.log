Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First stop, head north. With that accomplished, try to take a trip north. Then, move west. Then, make an attempt to head south. Then, go west. Once you get around to doing that, pick up the fly larva from the floor of the cookhouse. Got that? Good!

-= Bedroom =-
Well, here we are in the bedroom. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.



There is an unblocked exit to the north.

-= Shower =-
You're now in a shower.



There is an open door leading north. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

-= Cubicle =-
Well, here we are in a cubicle. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.



There is an open door leading south. There is an open gateway leading west.



>                                                                                                                                -= Cubicle =-0/3
AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go west
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Study =-
Of every study you could have walked into, you had to come round an usual one. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You see a locked coffer. You make out a trunk. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You scan the room for a stand, and you find a stand. The stand is typical. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is an open gateway leading east. There is an open gate leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.



>                                                                                                                                -= Study =-0/4
AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go south
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Vault =-
You make a grand eccentric entrance into a vault. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You see a suitcase. You make out a counter. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the counter.

You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the west.



>                                                                                                                                -= Vault =-0/5
AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go west

-= Cookhouse =-
You're now in the cookhouse.

You can make out a locked case, which looks usual, in the room.

There is an open portal leading north. There is an open hatch leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a fly larva on the floor.


>                                                                                                                                -= Cookhouse =-0/6
THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to pick up the fly larva from the cookhouse. So far, they've navigated through the bedroom, shower, cubicle, study, and vault, ending up in the cookhouse. The cookhouse has the fly larva on the floor. The previous action was going west into the cookhouse, and now they're here.

Looking at the current room description, the cookhouse has a locked case, an open portal north, a hatch south, and an unguarded east exit. The fly larva is on the floor. The user needs to pick it up. But the problem is, the larva is on the floor, so maybe they just need to pick it up directly. However, the game might require interacting with it. But the user hasn't picked it up yet. The previous steps were moving around, but the key action is to pick up the larva. Since the user is in the cookhouse, the next step is to pick up the fly larva. The command should be "take fly larva" or something similar. But the game might use different verbs. Alternatively, since it's on the floor, maybe just "get fly larva" or "pick up fly larva". The exact command depends on the game's accepted verbs. The user needs to pick it up, so the correct action here is to take the fly larva from the floor.
</think>pick up fly larva
