It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Your first objective is to make an effort to travel south. Then, make an effort to venture east. Okay, and then, venture south. With that done, make an effort to move south. Once you manage that, pick-up the keycard from the floor of the bar. That's it!

-= Cookhouse =-
You've just walked into a cookhouse. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. There is an unguarded exit to the south.
