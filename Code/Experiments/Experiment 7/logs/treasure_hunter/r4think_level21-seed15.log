Welcome to TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First, it would be good if you could make an attempt to move east. That done, make an attempt to go to the north. And then, pick-up the loaf of bread from the floor of the dish-pit. Alright, thanks!

-= Salon =-
You've entered a salon. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go east
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Canteen =-
You have walked into a canteen. Not the canteen you'd expect. No, this is a canteen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You see an opened freezer in the corner. What a letdown! The freezer is empty!

There is an open gate leading east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go north
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Dish-Pit =-
You arrive in a dish-pit. An ordinary one.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

There is a loaf of bread on the floor.


>                                                                                                                                -= Dish-Pit =-0/3

That's not a verb I recognise.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they need to complete certain tasks. The goal is to pick up the loaf of bread from the dish-pit. The user tried "pick-up loaf of bread" but got an error because the correct verb is "take" instead of "pick-up".

First, I need to recall the game's objective. The user was told to move east, then north, and finally pick up the bread. So the steps are: move east, move north, pick up the bread.

Looking at the user's actions so far: they went east from the salon to the canteen, then north to the dish-pit. Now they're in the dish-pit and need to pick up the bread. The correct command should be "take loaf of bread" instead of "pick-up".

The user's last attempt used "pick-up", which isn't recognized. So the next step is to use the correct verb "take". That should complete the task. The next action is to take the bread.
