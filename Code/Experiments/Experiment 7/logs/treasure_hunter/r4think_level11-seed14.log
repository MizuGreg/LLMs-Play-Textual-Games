Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an life changing round of TextWorld? You do! Here is your task for today. First of all, make an effort to move east. After that, recover the butterfly from the box inside the workshop. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Chamber =-
You find yourself in a chamber. An ordinary one.



There is an open gateway leading south. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Workshop =-
You've just shown up in a workshop.

You can see a box. The box contains a butterfly. You make out a locker. You can see a portmanteau.

You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

That's not a verb I recognise.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to play through this TextWorld game. The goal is to move east first, then recover the butterfly from the box in the workshop, and then stop. So far, they moved east from the chamber to the workshop. In the workshop, they tried to "recover butterfly from box," but the system said that's not a recognized verb.

Hmm, so the problem is that the command "recover butterfly from box" isn't valid. The game probably expects a different way to interact with the box. Maybe they need to open the box first or use a different verb like "take" or "get." Since the box is in the workshop, and the butterfly is inside, the correct action might be to open the box and then take the butterfly.

Wait, the user's previous action was "recover butterfly from box," which the game didn't recognize. So the next step should be to find the right verb. Maybe "open the box" first, then "take the butterfly." Alternatively, maybe "get the butterfly from the box." But the game might have specific verbs. Let me think: in TextWorld, common verbs are "take," "put," "open," "close," "use," etc. So perhaps the correct command is "open the box" to access the butterfly, then "take the butterfly."

But the user's next action should be to open the box. Since they tried to recover it directly, which didn't work, the next step is to open the box first. So the correct command would be "open the box." Then, after opening, they can take the butterfly. But since the user is at the workshop, and the box is there, the first action should be to open the box. So the next command should be "open the box."

That's already open.
