Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an life changing round of TextWorld? You do! First off, make an attempt to go to the east. Then, open the gate. After that, make an attempt to venture north. Once you succeed at that, go to the west. With that accomplished, move north. With that over with, make an attempt to go to the north. Then, recover the loaf of bread from the floor of the launderette. Alright, thanks!

-= Salon =-
You arrive in a salon. A normal one. You begin looking for stuff.

You can see a trunk. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a bench. You shudder, but continue examining the bench. The bench is standard. The bench appears to be empty.

There is an open door leading east. There is an open hatch leading west.

There is a fondue on the floor.

-= Study =-
You've entered a study. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

A locked portmanteau is in the corner.

There is a closed gate leading north. There is an open door leading west.

-= Chamber =-
You've just sauntered into a chamber.

You can see a desk. The desk is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open gate leading south. There is an open portal leading north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

Welcome to the basement. Let's see what's in here.

That's not a verb I recognise.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in a text-based game. The goal is to recover the loaf of bread from the launderette. So far, they've gone through the salon, study, chamber, playroom, basement, and now the launderette. The last step was trying to "recover bread," but that wasn't a valid command.

The user needs to figure out the correct action. The problem is that "recover" isn't a recognized verb here. The correct action might be "take" or "pick up" the bread. Since the bread is on the floor, the right command would be to pick it up. Let me check the previous steps again. The user was in the launderette, and the bread is on the floor. The valid command should be "take bread" or "pick up bread." Since the game might expect "take," that's probably the right move.
</think>take bread
