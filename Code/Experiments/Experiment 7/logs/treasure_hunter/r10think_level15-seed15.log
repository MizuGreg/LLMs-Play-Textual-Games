Welcome to another profound episode of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First step, go west. Then, try to take a trip south. Then, venture west. And then, make an effort to venture south. After that, make an effort to go to the east. Then, pick up the sandwich from the floor of the shower. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Studio =-
You find yourself in a studio. A typical one.

You can see a closed box right there by you.

There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

-= Lounge =-
Fancy seeing you here. Here, by the way, being the lounge. Let's see what's in here.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a bar. The bar is ordinary. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a couch. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The couch is typical. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You think about smashing the couch to bits, throwing the bits in the dump, etc, until you get bored. Look over there! a desk! Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is an unguarded exit to the east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

Ah, the workshop. This is some kind of workshop, really great standard vibes in this place, a wonderful standard atmosphere. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Lounge and Playroom. The goal is to pick up the sandwich from the shower. But so far, all the movements have been between these rooms without finding anything.

First, I need to recall the original instructions. The user was told to go west, then south, west again, south, east, then pick up the sandwich from the shower. But in the current setup, the user is repeatedly moving between Lounge and Playroom, which doesn't seem to be leading towards the shower.

Wait, maybe the shower is in a different part of the map. The initial steps were going west from the studio to the pantry, then south to the bedchamber, west to the lounge, south to the workshop, north back to lounge, then north to playroom, south back to lounge. This loop suggests that the user isn't progressing towards the shower.

The problem might be that the user hasn't found the right path. Maybe the sandwich is in a room that's not being visited yet. But according to the current rooms listed, the shower isn't mentioned. Maybe the user needs to check other rooms or find a different exit.

Alternatively, perhaps the user needs to look for a different direction. In the Lounge, there's an unguarded exit to the east and options to go north or south. But going east from the Lounge isn't mentioned in the previous steps. Wait, in the Lounge description, there's an unguarded exit to the east. Maybe the user should try going east instead of north or south.

But the user has been going north and south, which is causing the loop. So the next step should be to try going east from the Lounge. That might lead to a new room that's not been explored yet, possibly the shower or the sandwich location.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is stuck in a loop between the Lounge and Playroom, moving back and forth. The goal is to pick up the sandwich from the shower. So far, the user has been moving west, south, north, etc., but hasn't found the shower or the sandwich.

First, the goal is to follow the initial steps: go west, then south, west again, south, east, then get the sandwich. But the current path isn't leading to the shower. The user needs to find a different route.

Looking at the rooms, the Lounge has an exit to the east. Maybe that's the key. The user tried going east once before but ended up in the Bedchamber. Maybe there's another exit from the Bedchamber that wasn't explored yet. The Bedchamber has an exit to the north, which is unblocked. Going north from the Bedchamber might lead to a new area.

Wait, the user has been going back and forth between Lounge and Playroom, which are connected via south and north. Maybe the shower is in a room that's accessible from the Bedchamber's north exit. The user needs to try that path instead of looping.

So the next step is to go north from the Bedchamber. That's the next logical move after being in the Bedchamber. The user should try that to break the loop and proceed towards the shower.

-= Pantry =-
You are in a pantry. A standard kind of place.

You make out a rack! But there isn't a thing on it.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the south. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

-= Bedchamber =-
You're now in the bedchamber. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?



There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the south. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

-= Studio =-
You find yourself in a studio. A typical one.

You can see a closed box right there by you.

There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms to find the sandwich in the shower. The goal is to follow the steps: go west, then south, west again, south, east, then pick up the sandwich.

So far, the user has been moving between the Lounge, Playroom, Bedchamber, Pantry, and Studio. They've tried going east and south multiple times, but haven't found the shower yet. The current room is the Studio, where there's a closed box. The exit is to the west.

The problem is that the user is stuck in a loop between the Pantry and Studio. They need to find a way to proceed further. The next step should be to check the closed box in the Studio. Maybe the sandwich is in there or something else. But according to the initial instructions, the sandwich is in the shower. Wait, maybe the shower is in a different part of the map that hasn't been explored yet.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east from the Studio. But the Studio's exit is only to the west. So the next logical step is to check the closed box. If that doesn't work, maybe there's another exit or item that leads to the shower. But the user hasn't found it yet. So the next action should be to open the box or look around for clues.
