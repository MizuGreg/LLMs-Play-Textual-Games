Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an profound round of TextWorld? You do! Here is how to play! First of all, move east. Once you accomplish that, try to head east. That done, head north. Okay, and then, make an attempt to go to the west. Once you finish that, travel west. If you can get through with that, make an attempt to go west. If you can finish that, try to go west. After that, make an attempt to venture south. And then, travel east. Then, make an effort to move south. If you can do that, go south. With that over with, recover the keycard from the floor of the bar. Got that? Good!

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a TextWorld game and needs to navigate through different rooms to recover a keycard from the bar. The initial instructions mention moving in specific directions multiple times, but the current scenario shows the player is stuck in a loop between the Washroom and Cookery rooms.

First, I need to recall the goal: recover the keycard from the bar. The user has been moving east and west, which might be leading them in circles. Looking at the current room, the Restroom has exits to east and south. The previous steps were going west from the Washroom, which loops back to Cookery, then back to Washroom again. 

The user needs to find a way out of this loop. The key is to find an unguarded exit that leads towards the bar. In the Restroom, the south exit is unguarded. Maybe going south from here is the way to go. But the user has been going west and east, which might not be leading them towards the bar. The keycard is in the bar, so the path must lead to the bar's location.

Wait, the initial instructions said after moving east, north, west, etc., eventually venture south and east again. But the current position is in the Restroom. The south exit here is unguarded. Maybe that's the path. Alternatively, the user might need to find a different route. Since the user is stuck in a loop, changing the direction to south from the Restroom could be the next step. Let me check the available exits again. In the Restroom, east is unblocked, south is unguarded. So going south might be the correct move to break the loop and proceed towards the bar.

You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a board. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The board is usual. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in TextWorld to recover a keycard from the bar. The goal is to follow the path mentioned in the initial instructions: move east, then east again, north, west, west, west, south, east, south, south, and finally get the keycard.

Looking at the current room, the Studio has exits to east, north, and south. The user has been moving between rooms, but maybe they're stuck in a loop again. The previous steps included going south from the Closet to the Studio. Now, from the Studio, the open hatch south might be a path towards the bar. The keycard is in the bar, so moving south from here could be the next step. The user needs to proceed towards the bar without getting stuck in loops. The next action should be to go south from the Studio.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a loop between the Studio and Kitchen rooms, repeatedly going south and north. The goal is to recover the keycard from the bar. The initial instructions mentioned moving east, north, west, etc., but the user has been stuck in a cycle between Studio and Kitchen.

First, the goal is to find the keycard in the bar. The user needs to navigate through the rooms to reach the bar. However, the current path is looping without progress. The Studio has an open hatch south leading to the Kitchen, which has a hatch north back to Studio. This loop isn't getting them closer to the bar.

Next, the user's past actions have been moving between these two rooms repeatedly. The next step should be to find another exit or a different path. The Kitchen has an exit to the east, which might be a new direction. The user hasn't explored that yet. Going east from the Kitchen could lead to a different room that's not part of the loop.

Third, the loop is between Studio and Kitchen. To break it, the user needs to try a different direction. Instead of continuing to go south and north, they should try moving east from the Kitchen. That's a new action not previously taken in this loop. So the next command should be to go east from the Kitchen.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Studio and Kitchen rooms. The goal is to get the keycard from the bar. They've been moving back and forth without progress. The next step should be to find another exit or a different path. The Kitchen has an exit to the east, which might lead to a new area. Instead of repeating the same actions, they should try going east from the Kitchen. That's a new direction not yet explored in this loop. So the next command should be to go east.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

<think>
Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Studio and Kitchen rooms. The goal is to get the keycard from the bar. They've been moving back and forth without progress. The next step should be to find another exit or a different path. The Kitchen has an exit to the east, which might lead to a new area. Instead of repeating the same actions, they should try going east from the Kitchen. That's a new direction not yet explored in this loop. So the next command should be to go east.

-= Bar =-
Of every bar you could have shown up in, you had to come round an ordinary one.

You see a basket.

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

There is a keycard on the floor.
