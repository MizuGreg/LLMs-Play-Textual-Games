Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an exciting round of TextWorld? You do! Here is how to play! First, it would be good if you could attempt to head west. With that done, make an effort to take a trip south. Then, travel west. With that over with, make an effort to venture south. And then, move east. Then, move east. With that done, recover the passkey from the floor of the bar. And once you've done that, you win!

Welcome to the kitchen.

You make out a board. The board is usual. But there isn't a thing on it. You move on, clearly angry about your TextWorld experience.

You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.

<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The user is playing a text adventure game and needs to follow specific steps to win. The goal is to recover the passkey from the bar's floor and then win. 

First, I need to recall the initial instructions: go west, then south, then west again, south, east, east, then get the passkey. But the user has already moved through some areas. Let me check their current location.

The user is in the Scullery, which is room 4. The previous steps were: Kitchen (room 0) → Cookhouse (room 1) → Studio (room 2) → Scullery (room 3). The next step according to the initial plan was to go east twice, then get the passkey. But in the Scullery, the available exits are north, south, and east. The user needs to go east to the next room, which would be the bar, then maybe collect the passkey.

Wait, the initial plan said after moving east twice, recover the passkey from the bar's floor. So from Scullery (room 3), going east would take them to the bar (room 4?), then maybe another east to reach the floor where the passkey is. But the user is at Scullery (room 3), so the next step is to go east to the bar. Then, perhaps check the floor there. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action should be to go east from Scullery to reach the bar, then check the floor for the passkey. But the user's current location is Scullery, so the immediate next step is to go east. However, the user might be in a loop if they keep moving between rooms without progressing. But according to the initial plan, the next step after Scullery is to go east twice. So first, go east from Scullery to the bar, then east again to the floor. But the user is at Scullery (room 3), so first action is go east to the bar (room 4). Then, from there, go east again to the floor (room 5?), then pick up the passkey. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next step is to go east from Scullery.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through a text adventure game. The goal is to recover the passkey from the bar's floor and then win. The initial instructions said to go west, south, west, south, east, east, then get the passkey.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Studio (room 8). They tried going east but couldn't, then went north to Cookhouse (room 7), then south back to Studio (room 8). So they're stuck in a loop between Studio and Cookhouse. 

The problem is that the previous actions (go east, go north, go south) aren't progressing toward the passkey. The user needs to break the loop. Instead of repeating the same actions, maybe they should try a different direction. But in the Studio, the exits are north, south, west. They've already tried east, which isn't possible. So perhaps the next step is to go west from Studio to Cookhouse again, but that's already been done. Wait, maybe the user needs to check the locked toolbox or the closed bureau for clues? But the initial plan didn't mention those. Alternatively, maybe the passkey is in the Cookhouse's closed chest? The user hasn't checked that yet. But according to the initial instructions, the passkey is in the bar's floor. So maybe the user needs to go east from Cookhouse to reach the bar. But in the Cookhouse, the exits are east, south, west. The user is in Cookhouse (room 7), so going east would take them to the bar (room 8?), then maybe south to the floor. But the user just went from Studio (8) to Cookhouse (7) and back. So the next action should be to go east from Cookhouse to the bar, then check the floor. But the user is in Cookhouse, so the next command is go east.
