Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an exciting round of TextWorld? You do! Here is how to play! First stop, ensure that the passageway within the basement is open. And then, head south. And then, attempt to go west. Then, move north. Then, recover the poem from the floor of the bedchamber. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Basement =-
You're now in the basement. Let's see what's in here.

You can make out a locked chest. You see a safe. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You make out a shelf. The shelf is normal. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is a closed passageway leading south. There is an open door leading north. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Guess what, you are in a place we're calling an attic.

Were you looking for a suitcase? Because look over there, it's a suitcase. You can make out a locker. You can see a display.

There is an open gateway leading east. There is an open hatch leading north. There is an open door leading south.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is playing a text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and complete specific tasks. The goal mentioned in the initial prompt is to ensure the basement passageway is open, then go south, west, north, recover the poem from the bedchamber, and stop.

First, I need to recall the current state. The user started in the basement, went north to the attic. Now, in the attic, there's a suitcase, locker, display, and exits east, north, south. The next step according to the initial plan was to go west from the basement, but after going north to the attic, the next logical step might be to check the exits again. However, the user might be stuck in a loop if they keep moving between rooms without making progress towards the poem.

Looking at the current location (attic), the exits are east, north, south. The initial plan was to go west from the basement, but that's already done. Wait, the user's first action was "go north" from the basement, leading to the attic. Now, they need to proceed towards the bedchamber. The poem is in the bedchamber, so maybe the path involves going south from the attic to the basement again, then west, then north to reach the bedchamber. But the user is now in the attic. So the next step would be to go south back to the basement, then west, then north to the bedchamber. But the user might be repeating steps. Alternatively, maybe there's a different path. However, the user's previous action was going north, so they need to check if moving east or south from the attic is the next step. But the initial plan was to go south from the basement, then west, then north. So perhaps after the attic, the next step is to go south back to the basement, then west, then north to the bedchamber. But the user is in the attic now. So the next action should be to go south to the basement again. However, the user might be in a loop if they keep moving between attic and basement. But since the goal is to reach the bedchamber, the correct path is to go from attic south to basement, then west, then north to the bedchamber. So the next action is to go south from the attic.

You're now in the basement. Let's see what's in here.

You can make out a locked chest. You see a safe. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You make out a shelf. The shelf is normal. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through TextWorld, and they've been moving between the basement and attic. The goal is to ensure the passageway in the basement is open, then go south, west, north, recover the poem from the bedchamber, and stop.

First, I need to recap the goal step by step. The initial steps mentioned were: open the basement passageway, go south, then west, then north, recover the poem, then stop. But the user has already gone north from the basement to the attic, then south back to the basement. Now they're back in the basement again.

Looking at the current location, the basement has a closed passageway south, open door north, and exit west. The user's previous action was going south from the attic, which brought them back to the basement. Now, they need to check if the passageway is open. But the description says the passageway is closed. Wait, the first instruction said to ensure the passageway is open. But in the current state, it's closed. So maybe the user needs to find a way to open it.

But the user's next step after being in the basement again is to check if they've completed the steps. They had already gone north from the basement to the attic, then south back. So maybe they need to proceed west from the basement. The exit to the west is unblocked, so going west might be the next step. But the user's previous action was going south, which brought them back. So perhaps the next action is to go west from the basement. But the user is in the basement again, so the next step would be to go west. However, the initial instructions said after going south, then west, then north. But the user is now in the basement again. Wait, maybe the passageway south is closed, so they can't go south again. So the next step would be to go west from the basement. But the user is in the basement, so the available directions are south (closed), north (open), west (exit). So going west would be the next step. But the user's previous action was going south, which didn't help. So maybe they need to go west instead. But the initial plan was to go south, then west, then north. But since the passageway south is closed, maybe the user needs to find another way. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to open the passageway first. But how? The problem is that the user hasn't opened the passageway yet. The first step was to ensure the passageway is open. But in the current state, it's closed. So perhaps the user needs to find a way to open it. However, in the basement, there's a locked chest, a safe, and a shelf. Maybe interacting with those items is necessary. But the user hasn't done that yet. The initial instructions didn't mention opening the chest or safe, just ensuring the passageway is open. So maybe the user needs to find a way to open the passageway. But how? The problem is that the user is stuck in a loop between the basement and attic. So the next action should be to go west from the basement, as that's the only other direction available besides north. But the user is in the basement, so going west would be the next step. However, the user's previous action was going south, which didn't help. So maybe the user needs to go west instead. But the initial plan was to go south, then west. But since the passageway is closed, maybe the user needs to go west first. But the user is in the basement again, so the next step is to go west. But the user's previous action was going south, which didn't help. So the next action should be to go west. But the user is in the basement, so the command would be "go west".

-= Bedchamber =-
You find yourself in a bedchamber. An usual kind of place.



There is an unblocked exit to the east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

There is a poem on the floor.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is playing a text-based game where they need to follow specific steps to win. The goal is to ensure the basement passageway is open, go south, west, north, recover the poem from the bedchamber, and then stop.

Looking at the current state: The user is in the Bedchamber, which is room 4. The previous actions were going north from the Attic, then west to the Basement again, and now they're in the Bedchamber. The next step according to the initial instructions was to recover the poem from the floor of the bedchamber. 

In the current room, there's a poem on the floor. So the next logical step is to pick it up. The user needs to pick up the poem, which is the next step in the goal. They've already done the steps up to entering the Bedchamber, so the next action is to take the poem. The command should be "take poem" or "get poem". Since the game might use "take", that's the likely correct command here.
