It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! First thing I need you to do is to make an effort to go west. And then, try to head north. Then, assure that the gate is ajar. Then, make an attempt to venture east. After that, lift the stick of butter from the floor of the cubicle. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Attic =-
Well, here we are in the attic.

You see a safe. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can see a shelf. However, the shelf, like an empty shelf, has nothing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

You arrive in a spare room. A standard kind of place.

You make out a toolbox. The toolbox is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a coffer. Oh, great. Here's a display. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. This always happens!

There is an open portal leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

There is a passkey on the floor.

SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text-based game where they need to follow specific steps to win. The goal is to go west, then north, ensure the gate is ajar, venture east, lift the stick of butter from the cubicle, and then win.

Looking at the current environment, the user is in the Spare Room. They've already gone west from the Attic. Now, the next steps according to the initial instructions are to go north, check the gate, go east, and then get the butter.

In the Spare Room, there's an open portal north, so going north makes sense. The passkey is on the floor, but the main goal is to proceed through the rooms. The user needs to check if the gate is ajar, but the current description doesn't mention a gate. Maybe the gate is in the next room when they go north. Then, after going north, they might need to check the gate's state. Then go east, find the cubicle, and lift the butter.

Wait, the user's previous action was going west. Now, in the Spare Room, the next step is to go north as per the initial plan. The passkey might be a red herring or part of a different step. The key is to follow the sequence: west, north, check gate, east, get butter.

So the next action should be to go north. But the user has to make sure they don't loop. Since they're in the Spare Room, going north is the next logical step. The passkey might be useful later, but the immediate next step is north.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in TextWorld to complete the game. The goal is to go west, then north, ensure the gate is ajar, venture east, lift the stick of butter, and win.

First, the initial steps were going west from the Attic to the Spare Room. Then, the user went north to the Kitchenette. Now, in the Kitchenette, the next step according to the original plan was to check the gate east. But the current room has a closed gate leading east and an open portal south. The user needs to make sure the gate is ajar, so maybe they need to find a way to open it. However, the user hasn't found the stick of butter yet, which is part of the goal.

Wait, the user's past actions were go west, then go north. The next step in the original plan was to assure the gate is ajar. But in the Kitchenette, the gate east is closed. So maybe the user needs to find a way to open it. But the current room's description mentions a passkey on the floor in the Spare Room. Did the user pick that up yet? The user hasn't mentioned picking it up. So maybe the next step is to pick up the passkey from the Spare Room and use it to open the gate. But the user is currently in the Kitchenette. So perhaps they need to go back to the Spare Room, pick up the passkey, then go back to the Kitchenette to open the gate. Alternatively, maybe the passkey is in the Spare Room, so the user needs to go back west to the Spare Room, pick up the passkey, then return to the Kitchenette and use it to open the gate east. Then proceed east, find the stick of butter, and lift it.

But the user's last action was go north to the Kitchenette. Now, in the Kitchenette, the next step is to check the gate east. But it's closed. So maybe the user needs to find a way to open it. The passkey is in the Spare Room, so the user needs to go back west to the Spare Room, pick up the passkey, then return to the Kitchenette and use it to open the gate. Then go east, find the stick of butter, and lift it. But the user hasn't picked up the passkey yet. So the next step is to go west back to the Spare Room, pick up the passkey, then return to the Kitchenette to open the gate. However, the user is currently in the Kitchenette, so the next action should be to go west to the Spare Room. But the user's previous action was go north, so now they need to go west to return to the Spare Room. Then pick up the passkey. Then go back to the Kitchenette, open the gate, then go east. Then find the stick of butter. But the user hasn't done any of that yet. So the next step is to go west from the Kitchenette to the Spare Room to pick up the passkey. Then use it to open the gate east. Then proceed east. Then find the stick of butter. So the next command should be go west.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in TextWorld to complete the game. The goal is to go west, then north, ensure the gate is ajar, venture east, lift the stick of butter from the cubicle, and then win.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Steam Room. The previous actions were: go west (from Attic to Spare Room), then go north (to Kitchenette), then go west again (to Steam Room). Now, in the Steam Room, the exit is east. The next step according to the goal is to venture east. But the user has to make sure they lift the stick of butter from the cubicle. However, in the Steam Room, there's a bench and a box, but no mention of a cubicle or butter. Wait, maybe the cubicle is in a different room. The user needs to check if they've passed through the necessary rooms.

Wait, the initial instructions said after going west, north, ensure the gate is ajar, then venture east. Then lift the butter. So maybe after venturing east from the Steam Room, they would reach a room with the cubicle. But in the current room (Steam Room), the exit is east. So the next step should be to go east. But the user has to check if the gate is ajar. Wait, the gate is in the Kitchenette, leading east. The user was in the Kitchenette earlier, where there's a closed gate east. So maybe the gate needs to be opened. But the user hasn't done that yet. However, the current step is in the Steam Room, so the next action is to go east. But the user might have to open the gate first. However, the game might require going east from Steam Room, which leads to a room where the gate is. But the user's previous action was going west, so maybe they need to go east again. Wait, the user is in the Steam Room, exit east. So the next step is to go east. Then, perhaps they'll reach a room where the gate is, and then open it. But according to the initial steps, after going west, north, then ensure the gate is ajar. So maybe the gate is in the Kitchenette. But the user was in the Kitchenette earlier, where the gate is closed. So maybe the user needs to open it. But how? The user hasn't found the passkey yet. In the Spare Room, there's a passkey on the floor. So maybe the user needs to pick up the passkey and use it to open the gate. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the steps so far: went west (Attic to Spare Room), then north (to Kitchenette), then west again (to Steam Room). Now, in Steam Room, the exit is east. So the next step is to go east. But the user needs to collect the passkey first. Wait, the passkey is in the Spare Room. So maybe the user needs to go back to Spare Room to pick it up. But the user is in Steam Room now. So the path is: Steam Room east leads to where? Maybe the Kitchenette again? But the user was there before. Alternatively, maybe the Steam Room's east exit leads to a different room. But according to the current description, the Steam Room has an exit east. So going east from Steam Room would be the next step. But the user hasn't collected the passkey yet. So perhaps the user needs to go back west to Spare Room, pick up the passkey, then go north to open the gate. But the user's current position is Steam Room. So the next action is to go east. But the user might be in a loop if they keep going back and forth. However, the user's goal is to vent east, so maybe that's the next step. The user needs to go east from Steam Room. So the next command is go east.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through these different rooms in the TextWorld game. The goal is to follow specific steps: go west, then north, ensure the gate is ajar, venture east, lift the stick of butter from the cubicle, and then win.

Looking at the history, the user started in the Attic, went west to the Spare Room, then north to the Kitchenette. Then they went west again to the Steam Room and back east to the Kitchenette again. Now they're in the Kitchenette again, which seems like a loop.

The next step according to the initial plan was to check the gate east. But in the current Kitchenette, the gate east is closed. The user needs to make sure the gate is ajar. But in the previous steps, they didn't find the gate open. So maybe they need to find a way to open it or check if there's a key or something else.

Wait, in the Spare Room, there was a passkey on the floor. Maybe that's relevant. The user might need to pick up the passkey and use it to open the gate. But in the current Kitchenette, the gate is closed. So the next step would be to check if there's a way to open the gate, perhaps using the passkey.

But the user's previous action was going east from the Steam Room, which led back to the Kitchenette. Now they're stuck in a loop between Kitchenette and Steam Room. The next action should be to check the passkey or find a way to open the gate. However, the user hasn't picked up the passkey yet. So maybe the next step is to pick up the passkey from the Spare Room and use it to open the gate.

But the current location is the Kitchenette. The passkey was in the Spare Room, which is west of the Kitchenette. So the user needs to go west from Kitchenette to Spare Room, pick up the passkey, then go east to open the gate. But the user is in the Kitchenette again, so the next action should be to go west to the Spare Room again. However, the user might have already done that. Wait, the user's previous steps were: Attic -> Spare Room -> Kitchenette -> Steam Room -> Kitchenette. So they need to go west from Kitchenette to Spare Room again to pick up the passkey.

But in the Spare Room, the passkey is on the floor. So the user needs to pick it up. Then, maybe use it to open the gate east in the Kitchenette. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next step is to go west to the Spare Room, pick up the passkey, then go east to the Kitchenette again, then use the passkey to open the gate. But the user is currently in the Kitchenette, so the next action is to go west to the Spare Room again. However, the user might be in a loop here.

But the user might have already done that. Wait, in the initial steps, the user went west from Attic to Spare Room, then north to Kitchenette, then west to Steam Room, then east back to Kitchenette. So the Spare Room is west of Kitchenette. So the next action is to go west again to Spare Room, pick up the passkey, then go east to Kitchenette, then try to open the gate east. But the user hasn't picked up the passkey yet. So the next step is to go west to the Spare Room again to pick it up. But the user is in the Kitchenette, so the command would be "go west".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through these different rooms in TextWorld. The goal is to follow a specific sequence of actions: go west, then north, ensure the gate is ajar, venture east, lift the stick of butter from the cubicle, and then win.

Looking at the history, the user started in the Attic, went west to the Spare Room, then north to the Kitchenette, then west again to the Steam Room, then east back to the Kitchenette, and then west again to the Steam Room again. It seems like they're stuck in a loop between the Kitchenette and Steam Room.

In the current state, they're in the Steam Room again. The previous actions didn't lead to any progress towards the goal. The next step should be to break the loop. Instead of going west again, maybe they need to check the bench or the box, but the box is empty. Wait, the goal mentions lifting the stick of butter from the cubicle. Maybe the cubicle is in a different room. But the user hasn't found it yet.

Alternatively, maybe the gate in the Kitchenette is the one that needs to be opened. The user needs to ensure the gate is ajar. But in the Kitchenette, the gate leading east is closed. So perhaps they need to find a way to open it. But how? The previous actions didn't mention any keys or tools. There's a passkey on the floor in the Spare Room. Maybe picking it up and using it to open the gate?

Wait, the user's past actions include going west, north, east, west, etc., but they haven't picked up the passkey. In the Spare Room, there's a passkey on the floor. So maybe the next step is to pick up the passkey and use it to open the gate in the Kitchenette. That would break the loop and proceed towards the next step.

But the user's last action was going west again, which led back to the Steam Room. So the next action should be to go south from the Kitchenette to exit, but the user is in the Steam Room now. Wait, the current location is Steam Room, so maybe they need to go east again to the Kitchenette, then check the gate. But the user is stuck in a loop. So the key is to pick up the passkey from the Spare Room and use it to open the gate. But how to get back to the Spare Room? The user needs to go west from the Steam Room to the Kitchenette, then south to the Spare Room. Then pick up the passkey and use it to open the gate. Then proceed east to the next room.

Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game where they need to follow specific steps to win. The goal is to go west, then north, ensure the gate is ajar, venture east, lift the stick of butter from the cubicle, and then win.

Looking at the history of commands, the user has been moving between rooms: starting in the Attic, then Spare Room, Kitchenette, Steam Room, and back to Kitchenette. The previous actions were "go west", "go north", "go west", "go east", "go west", "go east" again. It seems like there's a loop between the Steam Room and Kitchenette. The user is stuck in a cycle, going back and forth between these two rooms without making progress towards the goal.

The next step according to the initial plan was to check the gate in the Kitchenette. But the gate is closed, and the user needs to make sure it's ajar. However, the current prompt in the Kitchenette mentions a closed gate east and an open portal south. The user hasn't found the stick of butter yet, which is the key item needed to win.

Since the user is looping between rooms, the next action should break the loop. Instead of repeating "go west" or "go east", maybe they need to interact with the environment. In the Steam Room, there was a secret button pressed, revealing an empty box. Perhaps there's something else to do in the Kitchenette. The user might need to check the bench or the closed gate. But the instruction says to lift the stick of butter from the cubicle. Wait, the cubicle wasn't mentioned in the current rooms. Maybe the user needs to find the cubicle where the butter is.

Alternatively, maybe the passkey on the floor in the Spare Room is important. The user hasn't picked it up yet. But in the current location (Kitchenette), the passkey isn't present. So perhaps the next step is to go south through the open portal to exit, but that's not part of the goal. The goal is to find the butter. Maybe the user needs to check the bench in the Steam Room or look for the cubicle elsewhere.

But according to the previous steps, the user hasn't found the stick of butter. The cubicle might be in a different room. Since the user is stuck in a loop, the next action should be to try a different command, like checking the bench or looking for the stick of butter. However, the user's previous actions were all movement commands. The correct next step might be to look for the stick of butter in the current room, but the current room (Kitchenette) doesn't mention it. Therefore, the user needs to find the cubicle where the butter is. Maybe the cubicle is in the Steam Room or another room. But the user needs to break the loop by trying a different action, like using the passkey or interacting with the bench.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in TextWorld to complete the game. The goal is to go west, then north, ensure the gate is ajar, venture east, lift the stick of butter from the cubicle, and then win.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Spare Room again after going south from the Kitchenette. The previous steps have led them in a loop between the Kitchenette and Spare Room. The challenge here is to avoid repeating the same actions and find a new path.

In the Spare Room, there's a passkey on the floor. The goal mentions lifting the stick of butter from the cubicle, but the current description doesn't mention a cubicle. However, the user might need to pick up the passkey, which could be a key item for opening the gate mentioned earlier.

The next step should be to pick up the passkey. Since the user has been looping between rooms, using a synonym for "go west" might not work if the action is already recognized. Instead, picking up the passkey could be a new action that advances the game. So the next command should be to take the passkey.
