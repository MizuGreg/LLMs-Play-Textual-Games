Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an fast paced round of TextWorld? You do! Here is your task for today. Your first objective is to make an attempt to travel east. After that, move north. If you can get through with that, pick up the Comic Strip Calendar from the floor of the workshop. Alright, thanks!

-= Office =-
You find yourself in an office. An ordinary one. The room is well lit.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.
