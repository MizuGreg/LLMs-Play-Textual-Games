Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First thing I need you to do is to move south. Then, open the gateway inside the studio. If you have pulled open the gateway, head west. After that, travel south. Following that, open the passageway. And then, attempt to go to the south. With that accomplished, attempt to take a trip west. Then, venture north. And then, retrieve the poem from the floor of the bedchamber. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Office =-
You've entered an office. You can barely contain your excitement.



There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.
