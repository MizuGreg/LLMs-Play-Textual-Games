Welcome to TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First, it would be a great idea if you could make an effort to head east. Then, attempt to head north. After that, try to head west. With that over with, lift the passkey from the floor of the bar. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Laundromat =-
You find yourself in a laundromat. An ordinary kind of place.



There is an unguarded exit to the east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Closet =-
You are in an usual kind of place. That is to say, you're in a closet. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.



You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-

Okay, let me try to figure out what to do next. The user is in the Closet room. The goal is to lift the passkey from the bar's floor. So far, they've gone east to the Canteen, then north to the Closet. Now, they need to find the passkey.

In the Closet, the possible directions are south and west. The previous actions were going east, north, and now maybe south or west. But the user is told to lift the passkey from the bar's floor. Wait, the initial task mentioned the bar, but the current location is the Closet. Maybe the passkey is in the Closet? Or perhaps there's a way to get back to the bar.

Wait, the initial description said the passkey is on the floor of the bar. So the user needs to reach the bar. The current location is the Closet. The exits here are south and west. Let me check the previous steps again.

First, they went east to the Canteen. Then north to the Closet. From the Closet, going south would take them back to the Canteen, and west might be another direction. But the bar is probably not directly accessible yet. Maybe the passkey is in the Closet? The user needs to check if the passkey is here. But the initial instruction said the passkey is in the bar. Hmm.

Wait, maybe there's a mistake. The user's task is to lift the passkey from the bar's floor. So they need to get to the bar. The current location is the Closet. The exits are south (Canteen) and west. Maybe the bar is connected through another path. But the user hasn't explored west yet. So perhaps the next step is to go west from the Closet. But the user is in the Closet, and the directions are south and west. If they go west, maybe they can find the bar.

Alternatively, maybe the passkey is in the Closet. But the original instruction said it's in the bar. So the user needs to find the bar. Let me think again. The initial steps were east, then north. Now in the Closet. The user needs to go back to the Canteen, then maybe east again? Wait, the Canteen has an exit to the north and west. Wait, the Canteen's description says there's an unguarded exit to the north and west. So from the Canteen, going north would take them back to the Closet, and west might be another room. But the bar is not mentioned yet. Maybe the bar is in a different area.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west from the Closet. Let me check the Closet's description again. The Closet says: "You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked." So west is unblocked. So going west from the Closet. That would take them to another room. Maybe the bar is there? Or perhaps the passkey is in the Closet. But the original task says it's in the bar. So the user needs to find the bar.

Wait, maybe the user is in the Closet, and the bar is connected through the west direction. So the next step is to go west. Then, once in that room, check if the passkey is there. If not, continue exploring. But the user's goal is to lift the passkey from the bar's floor. So the user needs to reach the bar. Therefore, from the Closet, go west. That's the next step.
