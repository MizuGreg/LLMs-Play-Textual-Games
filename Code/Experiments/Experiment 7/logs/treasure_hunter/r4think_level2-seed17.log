THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user's goal is to recover the fondue from the floor of the pantry. So far, they've been moving between the Pantry, Kitchen, Office, and back to Pantry. The problem is that every time they try to go north, south, east, or west, they end up looping between these rooms. The fondue is in the pantry, but they can't get out because the exits are blocked except for the office.

Wait, in the Office, there's an unguarded exit to the south. So maybe the loop is because they keep going back to the pantry. The user needs to find a way out of the pantry to reach the fondue. But the fondue is on the floor, so maybe they just need to pick it up once they're in the pantry. But the issue is getting out of the pantry. The previous steps showed that going south from the office leads back to the pantry. So maybe the correct path is to go from the office south to pantry, then find the fondue and take it. But the user is stuck in a loop between pantry and office. So the next step should be to go south from the office to the pantry, then take the fondue. But the user is already in the pantry again. Wait, the last state was in the pantry again. So maybe the next action is to take the fondue. But the instruction says to output a command like "go north". But the fondue is already in the pantry. So maybe the user needs to take it. However, the game might require moving to a position where the fondue is accessible. But the description says "There is a fondue on the floor." So perhaps the user just needs to pick it up. But the commands are movement-based. Wait, maybe the user hasn't picked it up yet. So the correct action is to take the fondue. But the previous commands were movement. However, the user's last action was "go north" which brought them back to the pantry. So maybe the next step is to take the fondue. But the game's commands might not include taking items unless specified. Wait, looking back at the initial problem, the user's objective is to recover the fondue, so maybe the correct action is to take it once in the pantry. But the user hasn't done that yet. However, the previous responses were movement commands. So perhaps the user needs to move to a position where they can take the fondue. But the fondue is on the floor of the pantry. So maybe the correct action is to take the fondue. But the game's commands might not include that. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east, north, or south to find a way out, but the loop is preventing that. The user is stuck in a loop between pantry and office. So the next action should be to go south from the office to the pantry, then take the fondue. But the user is already in the pantry. So the next step is to take the fondue. However, the game might require movement. Wait, the initial problem says that the user is in the pantry, and the fondue is on the floor. So maybe the correct action is to take the fondue. But the user's previous actions were movement. So perhaps the answer is to take the fondue. But the user's last action was "go north", which brought them back to the pantry. So the next step is to take the fondue. But the game might not have a "take" command. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to move east to find an exit. But the pantry's exits are east, north, south. But going east might lead to another room. However, the user is in a loop. So the correct action is to go east, but the user has to avoid the loop. Alternatively, the user should take the fondue. But the game might require movement. So the answer is to take the fondue.
