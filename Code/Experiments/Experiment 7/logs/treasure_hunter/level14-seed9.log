Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an exciting round of TextWorld? You do! Here is how to play! First stop, ensure that the passageway within the basement is open. And then, head south. And then, attempt to go west. Then, move north. Then, recover the poem from the floor of the bedchamber. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Basement =-
You're now in the basement. Let's see what's in here.

You can make out a locked chest. You see a safe. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You make out a shelf. The shelf is normal. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is a closed passageway leading south. There is an open door leading north. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Attic =-
Guess what, you are in a place we're calling an attic.

There is an open gateway leading east. There is an open hatch leading north. There is an open door leading south.
