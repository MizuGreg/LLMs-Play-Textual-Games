Welcome to TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, you could, like, attempt to go to the south. Then, head west. Then, lift the carrot from the floor of the chamber. That's it!

-= Attic =-
You have entered an attic. Not the attic you'd expect. No, this is an attic. The room is well lit.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

There is a latchkey on the floor.

go south

-= Bedchamber =-
Well, here we are in the bedchamber.



There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go west
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Chamber =-
Okay, so you're in a chamber, cool, but is it usual? You better believe it is. You begin looking for stuff.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a carrot on the floor.

That's not a verb I recognise.
