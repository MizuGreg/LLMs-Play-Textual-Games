Welcome to another fast paced session of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First thing I need you to do is to make an effort to go south. Then, pick-up the chocolate bar from the floor of the chamber. That's it!

-= Kitchenette =-
I just think it's great that you've just entered a kitchenette.

You can see a freezer.

There is an open hatch leading north. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Chamber =-
You make another one of your grand eccentric entrances into a chamber.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the north.

There is a chocolate bar on the floor.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text-based game where they need to reach a goal. The current scenario is in a Chamber with a chocolate bar on the floor. The previous action was going south from the Kitchenette to the Chamber.

First, the goal is to pick up the chocolate bar and exit. The user has already moved south, which was the first step. Now, they need to pick up the chocolate bar. The next logical step is to pick it up. But the user's last action was going south, and the current location is the Chamber. The prompt says to pick up the chocolate bar from the floor. So the next action should be to pick up the chocolate bar. However, the user might be in a loop if they keep moving between rooms without progressing. But since the chocolate is in the Chamber, and the exit is to the east or north, the correct next step is to pick up the chocolate. The user needs to take that action now.
