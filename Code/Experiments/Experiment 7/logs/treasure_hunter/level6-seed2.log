Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First thing I need you to do is to travel east. And then, venture south. Then, pick up the latchkey from the floor of the workshop. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Kitchen =-
Well, here we are in the kitchen.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

>                                                                                                                                -= Kitchen =-0/1
AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go east
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Bedchamber =-
You arrive in a bedchamber. An ordinary kind of place. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.



You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

-= Workshop =-
You've just sauntered into a workshop.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the north.

There is a gummy bear and a latchkey on the floor.
