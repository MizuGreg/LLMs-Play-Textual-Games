I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Your first objective is to go to the north. With that accomplished, attempt to go to the west. Okay, and then, make an attempt to go to the north. Then, take a trip north. With that over with, pick up the loaf of bread from the floor of the launderette. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Study =-
You've entered a study. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

A locked portmanteau is in the corner.

There is an open gate leading north. There is an open door leading west.

-= Chamber =-
You've just sauntered into a chamber.

You can see a desk. The desk is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open portal leading north. There is an open gate leading south. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

-= Playroom =-
You arrive in a playroom. You begin to take stock of what's here.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Basement =-
Welcome to the basement. Let's see what's in here.



There is an open passageway leading east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Launderette =-
You find yourself in a launderette. An usual one.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

There is a loaf of bread on the floor.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to go north, then west, then north again, pick up the bread, and stop. So far, they've gone north from the study to the chamber, then west to the playroom, then north to the basement, and then north again to the launderette. Now, in the launderette, they need to pick up the bread. The current prompt says there's a loaf of bread on the floor. The next step is to pick it up. But the user's last action was going north, which led them to the launderette. Now, they need to take the bread. The correct command here is "take loaf of bread" or "pick up loaf of bread". Since the game might expect a specific command, I should check the previous interactions. The user was told to "pick up the loaf of bread from the floor of the launderette" so the correct action is to take it. The next step after that is to stop. So the next command should be "take loaf of bread".
</think>take loaf of bread
