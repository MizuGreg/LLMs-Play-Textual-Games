THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to lift the candy bar from the laundry place. Looking at the steps they've taken, they've moved through several rooms: cubicle, kitchenette, steam room, closet, laundromat, basement, chamber, restroom, attic, spare room, playroom, and back to the spare room. 

In the laundromat, there's a locked case mentioned. The user hasn't interacted with it yet. The candy bar is in the laundry place, which is the laundromat. Since the case is locked, the next step might be to find a key or way to open it. 

The user is currently in the spare room, which connects back to the laundromat. The previous actions led them back to the spare room, so maybe they need to go back to the laundromat and try to open the locked case. The key might be in the attic or another room, but the user hasn't checked there yet. Alternatively, maybe the candy bar is in the laundromat's locked case, and they need to find the key to open it.

Since the user is in the spare room, the next step should be to go east back to the laundromat. Then, check the locked case. If the case is locked, they might need to use the latchkey from the attic. But the user hasn't tried that yet. So the next action is to go east to the laundromat and attempt to open the case.
