You are now playing a exciting game of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First off, take a trip north. Following that, ensure that the hatch within the cubicle is open. Then, make an effort to go to the west. Next, go north. After that, assure that the passageway inside the sauna is wide open. Then, try to go to the north. Next, make absolutely sure that the walnut gate is ajar. Then, travel west. With that accomplished, go to the south. Then, pick up the latchkey from the floor of the closet. That's it!

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text adventure game, and they've followed a set of instructions to reach certain locations and interact with objects. Let me break down their current situation.

First, the initial task was to go north, then open the hatch in the cubicle, go west, north again, ensure the passageway in the sauna is open, go north, make sure the walnut gate is open, travel west, then go south to pick up the latchkey from the closet. 

Looking at the current state: The user is in the Cubicle. They just opened the hatch leading west. The next step according to the original plan was to go west. But the user's last action was opening the hatch, and now they're in the Cubicle. Wait, the previous step was going north from the Chamber to the Cubicle. Then, in the Cubicle, they opened the hatch (which was closed), and now they're in the Cubicle. The next step in the original plan was to go west from the Cubicle. But the user hasn't done that yet. 

Wait, the user's last action was "open hatch", which was successful. Now, they need to go west from the Cubicle. But the prompt says that after opening the hatch, the next step is to go west. However, the user might be stuck in a loop if they keep doing the same actions. But in this case, the user hasn't gone west yet. So the next step should be to go west. But the user's last action was opening the hatch, so they need to go west next. 

Wait, but in the current environment, after opening the hatch, the user is in the Cubicle. The Cubicle has a closed hatch leading west and an open portal south. So, the user needs to go west through the hatch. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action should be to go west. But the user might be in a loop if they keep going back and forth. However, according to the original plan, after opening the hatch, the next step is to go west. Then, after that, go north again. So the user needs to go west from the Cubicle. 

But the user's last action was opening the hatch, so the next step is to go west. However, the user might have already done that. Wait, looking at the history: The user first went north from the Chamber to the Cubicle. Then, in the Cubicle, they opened the hatch (which was closed). Now, they are in the Cubicle. The next step is to go west through the hatch. So the next action should be "go west". But the user hasn't done that yet. Therefore, the next action is to go west. 

But the user might be in a loop if they keep going back and forth. However, in this case, the user hasn't gone west yet. So the correct next action is to go west. But the user's previous action was opening the hatch, so they need to go west next. Therefore, the answer should be "go west".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in the text adventure game. Let me recap the goal again. The original task was: go north, open the hatch in the cubicle, go west, go north again, open the passageway in the sauna, go north, open the walnut gate, go west, then go south to pick up the latchkey from the closet.

Looking at the current state: The user is in the Office. They just opened the walnut gate leading east. The next step according to the original plan was to go west after opening the walnut gate. But in the current environment, the Office has an open walnut gate leading east and a passageway south. Wait, the user's last action was opening the walnut gate, and now they're in the Office. The next step should be to go west, but the Office's description says there's an open walnut gate leading east and a passageway south. Wait, maybe the user is supposed to go south from the Office? Let me check the previous steps.

Wait, the original plan after opening the walnut gate was to travel west. But in the Office, the walnut gate is leading east, so going west from the Office would be the opposite direction. Maybe the user is confused here. Let me check the previous steps again.

The user's path so far: Chamber -> Cubicle (opened hatch) -> Study -> Sauna (opened passageway) -> Bathroom (opened walnut gate) -> Office. Now, in the Office, the next step according to the original plan was to go west after opening the walnut gate. But the Office's walnut gate is leading east, so going west from the Office would be the correct direction. However, the Office's description mentions a passageway south. But the original plan says after opening the walnut gate, travel west. So the user should go west from the Office. But the Office's description says there's an open passageway south. Wait, maybe the user is supposed to go south next? Or is there a loop here?

Wait, the original plan after the walnut gate was to travel west, then go south to pick up the latchkey. So from the Office, after opening the walnut gate, the next step is to go west. But the Office's description says there's an open passageway south. Maybe the user is in a loop between the Office and another room. Let me check the previous steps again.

Wait, the user is in the Office now. The previous steps were: after opening the walnut gate in the Bathroom, they went west to the Office. Now, in the Office, the next step is to go south as per the original plan. Wait, the original plan says after opening the walnut gate, travel west. But the Office is already west of the Bathroom. Maybe there's a confusion here. Let me retrace:

Original steps:

1. Go north (done)
2. Open hatch in cubicle (done)
3. Go west (done, from cubicle to study)
4. Go north (done, from study to sauna)
5. Open passageway in sauna (done)
6. Go north (done, from sauna to bathroom)
7. Open walnut gate (done, in bathroom)
8. Go west (should be next, but from bathroom to office)
9. Go south (to pick up latchkey)

Wait, after opening the walnut gate in the bathroom, the next step was to go west, which led to the Office. Now, in the Office, the next step should be to go south to reach the closet where the latchkey is. But the Office's description says there's a passageway south. So the user should go south from the Office. But according to the original plan, after going west (to the Office), the next step is to go south. So the correct next action is to go south. However, the user's last action was opening the walnut gate, and now they're in the Office. The next step is to go south. But the user might have already done that. Wait, the original plan says after going west (to the Office), then go south. So the next action is go south. Therefore, the answer should be "go south".

-= Closet =-
You find yourself in a closet. An ordinary one. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You see a stand. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north.

There is a latchkey on the floor.
