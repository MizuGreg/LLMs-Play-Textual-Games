Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, try to move south. And then, go west. Next, head north. That done, make an attempt to go north. With that done, pick-up the knife from the floor of the cookhouse. That's it!

-= Cookery =-
You find yourself in a cookery. A normal one. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.



You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Pantry =-
You are in a pantry. A typical kind of place.



There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

There is a sock on the floor.

-= Parlor =-
Guess what, you are in a place we're calling a parlor. The room is well lit.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

-= Shower =-
This might come as a shock to you, but you've just moved into a shower. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.



>                                                                                                                                -= Shower =-0/4
