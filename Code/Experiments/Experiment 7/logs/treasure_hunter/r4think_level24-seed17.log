It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is how to play! Your first objective is to make an effort to move north. Once you succeed at that, head west. After that, take the keycard from the stand in the attic. Having taken the keycard, make an effort to go east. Next, assure that the gateway inside the studio is unlocked with the keycard. If you have unlocked the gateway, open the gateway within the studio. Then, make an effort to head east. Following that, make an effort to go south. After that, pick up the garlic clove from the fridge within the dish-pit. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Salon =-
You are in a salon. An usual kind of place.



There is an unblocked exit to the north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

There is an unguarded exit to the east.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game and needs to follow specific steps to win. Let me break down what's been done so far.

First, the goal is to move north, then west, take the keycard from the attic stand, use it to unlock the studio's gateway, go east, south, pick up the garlic clove from the fridge in the dish-pit. 

Looking at the current state: The user is in the Attic, took the keycard. The next step according to the original plan was to go east from the Attic, but the previous action was going west from the Studio to the Attic. Wait, the user just took the keycard in the Attic. The next step should be to go east from the Attic to return to the Studio, then use the keycard on the locked trunk or gateway.

Wait, the Studio has a closed gateway leading east. The user needs to unlock it with the keycard. So after taking the keycard in the Attic, they should go back east to the Studio, then use the keycard on the gateway. Then proceed east again, then south, then go to the dish-pit to get the garlic.

But the user is currently in the Attic. The previous action was taking the keycard. The next step is to go east from the Attic to the Studio. Then unlock the gateway. So the next command should be 'go east' from the Attic. But the user might have already done that? Wait, no. The user was in the Studio, went west to the Attic, took the keycard. Now they need to go east back to the Studio. Then use the keycard on the locked trunk or gateway. The gateway in the Studio is closed and needs to be unlocked. So the next action is to go east from the Attic to the Studio, then use the keycard on the gateway. But the current location is the Attic. So the next step is to go east.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to win the game by following specific steps. The current situation is in the Studio, where they've already unlocked the gateway with the keycard. The next steps according to the original plan were to go east, then south, then get the garlic clove.

But the user tried to go east after unlocking the gateway, and the game said they have to open the gateway first. Wait, but they just unlocked it. Maybe the gateway is still closed even though they used the keycard? Or maybe the command wasn't recognized properly. The user tried "unlock gateway" again, and the response was that it's already unlocked. So maybe the gateway is now open, but the user needs to proceed east.

Wait, the previous action was unlocking the gateway, and the game responded that it's unlocked. So maybe the next step is to go east again. But the user tried that and the game said they have to open the gateway first. That's confusing because they just unlocked it. Maybe there's a mistake in the game's feedback, or maybe the gateway needs to be opened again. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check if the gateway is actually open after unlocking.

But according to the game's message, after unlocking, the gateway is open. So the next step should be to go east. The user might be stuck in a loop because they keep trying to go east but the game says the gateway needs to be opened. But since they've already unlocked it, maybe the correct action is to proceed east. The user should try "go east" again, even though the game says to open the gateway. Maybe the game's message is a glitch, or maybe the user needs to confirm the gateway is open. But the correct next step is to go east from the Studio to the next area, then proceed to the dish-pit for the garlic.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in the Studio, having just opened the gateway. The goal is to go east from the Studio, then south, then get the garlic clove.

Previous steps: Started in Salon, went north to Studio, west to Attic, took keycard, returned to Studio, unlocked gateway, opened it. Now, the gateway is open, so the next step is to go east. But the game might be expecting a different command. Wait, the user just opened the gateway, so maybe they can proceed east. The next area after Studio east is probably the dish-pit or another room. The user needs to go east, then south to reach the dish-pit. So the next command should be "go east" again. But the game might have a loop if the user keeps trying the same action. However, since the gateway is open, going east should be possible. So the correct next step is to go east.

Well, here we are in a recreation zone.

You make out an opened safe. What a letdown! The safe is empty!

There is an open gateway leading west. There is an open hatch leading north. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

You see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a garlic clove.

You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.
