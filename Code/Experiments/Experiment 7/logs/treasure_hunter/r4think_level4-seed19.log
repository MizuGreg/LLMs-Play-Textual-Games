Welcome to another life changing game of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First, it would be a great idea if you could make an attempt to go west. Then, pick-up the passkey from the floor of the cubicle. Got that? Good!

-= Laundry Place =-
You arrive in a laundry place. A normal one. You begin to take stock of what's here.



You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

>                                                                                                                                -= Laundry Place =-0/1

-= Cubicle =-
I am sorry to announce that you are now in the cubicle.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north.

There is a passkey and a key on the floor.

That's not a verb I recognise.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in the game because they tried to pick up the passkey but got an error. The goal is to get the passkey and exit the cubicle. The user first went west, then tried to pick up the passkey. But the game didn't recognize "pick-up" as a verb. So maybe the correct command is "take passkey" instead.

First step: The goal is to get the passkey and exit. The user already went west to the cubicle and picked up the passkey (though the game said it wasn't recognized). Now they need to exit east. But the game says the exit is to the east, so maybe they need to go east. But the user is in the cubicle, so the next step is to go east. But the previous attempt to go north was suggested. Wait, the cubicle has an exit to the east, so going east would exit. But the user is in the cubicle, so maybe they need to go east. However, the user tried going north before. Wait, the cubicle's description says there's an exit to the east. So the correct action is to go east. But the user might have tried going north before, which was a mistake. So the next step is to go east. But the user's last action was trying to pick up the passkey, which failed. So the correct next action is to take the passkey (using the correct verb) and then go east. But since the game didn't recognize "pick-up", maybe the correct verb is "take". So the user should take the passkey first, then go east. But the user is in the cubicle, so after taking the passkey, they can exit east. So the next action is to take the passkey. But the user tried that and got an error. Wait, the user's last input was "pick-up passkey", which the game didn't recognize. So the correct verb is "take" instead of "pick-up". So the next action should be "take passkey". Then, after taking it, go east. So the next command is "take passkey".
