Welcome to another life changing round of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to try to head east. Okay, and then, try to go east. Then, go north. Once you get through with that, make an effort to go to the east. Once you accomplish that, try to head south. Following that, venture south. Then, go west. And then, go west. Then, retrieve the keycard from the saucepan. That's it!

-= Dish-Pit =-
You are in a dish-pit. An usual one.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an unguarded exit to the south. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user's goal is to retrieve the keycard from the saucepan. So far, they've been moving around different rooms, going east, north, south, west, and back. They've gone through the dish-pit, vault, cubicle, cookhouse, bedroom, laundry place, and back. The keycard is supposed to be in the saucepan, but the user hasn't found it yet.

Looking at the current location, they're in the Cubicle again. The previous steps might have looped them between rooms. The instruction mentions breaking the loop by using a synonym if needed. Since they've been going east and west repeatedly, maybe trying a different direction like north or south could help. But in the Cubicle, the exits are east, north, south, west. The user already tried east and west, so maybe trying north or south next. However, in the Cubicle, the north exit is unblocked, and south is unguarded. But the user might have already tried those. Wait, in the Cubicle, the previous action was going east, leading back to Cookhouse. Maybe the keycard is in the saucepan in another room, like the Cookhouse or Bedroom. But the user hasn't checked those areas for the saucepan. Alternatively, maybe the keycard is in the Laundry Place or another room. But the user needs to find the saucepan first. Since the user is in the Cubicle again, perhaps they need to check the toolbox or other items in the Cubicle. Wait, the Cubicle has a toolbox. Maybe the keycard is in the toolbox? But the user hasn't checked that yet. Alternatively, the saucepan might be in the Cookhouse. The user needs to look for the saucepan in the rooms they've visited. Since the user is stuck in a loop, they need to try a different approach. Maybe instead of moving east and west, they should check the items in the current room for the saucepan. But the Cubicle has a toolbox and an armchair. The saucepan isn't mentioned here. So maybe the user needs to go to the Cookhouse again and check there. The Cookhouse has a garlic clove, but not the saucepan. The Bedroom has a coffer and couch. The Laundry Place has a locked trunk. Maybe the saucepan is in the Vault or Dish-pit? But the user hasn't checked those. Alternatively, maybe the keycard is in the saucepan in the Cookhouse. The user needs to find the saucepan and then retrieve the keycard. Since the user is stuck in a loop, they need to try a different action. The next step would be to check the items in the current room (Cubicle) for the saucepan. If not there, move to another room. But the user hasn't checked the Cubicle's items yet. So the next action should be to look around in the Cubicle for the saucepan. However, the user's previous actions were moving between rooms. So maybe the correct next step is to check the Cubicle's items. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the answer should be to look for the saucepan in the Cubicle or check the items there.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to retrieve the keycard from the saucepan. So far, they've been moving between rooms, but haven't found the saucepan or the keycard. They're stuck in a loop between the Laundry Place, Bedroom, and Cubicle.

First step: The goal is to find the saucepan and get the keycard. The user needs to check each room for the saucepan. So far, they've checked the Cubicle, Cookhouse, Bedroom, Laundry Place, but didn't find it. 

Second step: Past actions include moving east, north, south, west repeatedly. The next step should be to check the items in the current room (Laundry Place) again, maybe looking for the saucepan. But the user tried "look around" and it didn't work. Maybe they need to check other rooms again.

Third step: They're in a loop, so they need to try a different action. Instead of moving east again, maybe check the trunk in the Laundry Place. The trunk is locked, but perhaps there's a key needed. Alternatively, check the table in the corner. But the user hasn't tried that yet. The next action should be to check the locked trunk or the table.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop, repeatedly trying to look around in the Laundry Place but not finding the saucepan. The goal is to retrieve the keycard from the saucepan. So far, the user has moved through several rooms but hasn't found the saucepan yet.

First step: The goal is to find the saucepan and get the keycard. The user needs to check all possible locations where the saucepan might be. So far, they've checked the Cubicle, Cookhouse, Bedroom, and Laundry Place, but haven't found it.

Second step: The past actions involve moving between rooms and looking around, but nothing has worked. The next step should be to check other rooms again, maybe the Vault or Dish-pit, since those were the starting points. Alternatively, check the locked trunk in the Laundry Place for the saucepan.

Third step: The user is in a loop, so they need to try a different approach. Instead of looking around, maybe they should check the trunk in the Laundry Place. The trunk is locked, so perhaps they need a key. But the user hasn't tried that yet. The next action should be to check the trunk or the table in the Laundry Place.

Okay, the user is trying to open the locked trunk in the Laundry Place but keeps getting errors because they're using "use keycard" as a verb. The goal is to retrieve the keycard from the saucepan. So far, they've tried looking around, moving between rooms, and now trying to open the trunk. The trunk is welded shut, so maybe they need a different approach. Since the previous actions didn't work, they need to try a synonym or different command. The correct verb here is "open" followed by the object. The user tried "use keycard" which isn't the right verb. The next step is to try "open trunk" again, but since it's welded, maybe there's another way. Alternatively, check the table in the corner for the saucepan. But the user hasn't found the saucepan yet. The next action should be to check the table or try a different command.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, the user is stuck trying to open the welded trunk in the Laundry Place. The goal is to get the keycard from the saucepan. So far, they've tried opening the trunk multiple times but it's not working. They need to find another way. Maybe the saucepan is in a different room. They should check other areas like the Cookhouse or Bedroom. Alternatively, look for a tool to open the trunk. But the user hasn't found the saucepan yet. The next step is to check the table in the Laundry Place corner for the saucepan. If not there, move to another room.
