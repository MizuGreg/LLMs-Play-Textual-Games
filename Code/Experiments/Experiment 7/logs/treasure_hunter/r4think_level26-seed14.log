Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First step, ensure that the door inside the workshop is open. After that, make an attempt to go north. After that, head east. Okay, and then, make an effort to take a trip north. And then, make an effort to venture north. Okay, and then, try to travel east. With that over with, take a trip north. Once you do that, take a trip east. Then, try to go south. With that over with, travel south. With that accomplished, head south. With that over with, pick up the mop from the floor of the laundry place. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Workshop =-
I am honoured to announce that you are now in the workshop.



There is a closed door leading north. There is an open gateway leading east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to solve this text-based game. The main goal is to open the door in the workshop, then go north, east, etc., and eventually pick up the mop.

First, the user tried to go north but the door was closed. Then they tried to open the door, but the system only recognized "open door north" as the action. But the problem is that the door is closed, so they need to open it first. However, the system's response indicates that the user hasn't successfully opened the door yet. The user is in a loop where they keep trying to go north without opening the door, and the system keeps reminding them to open the door first.

So, the next step is to figure out how to open the door. The user might need to use a different command. Maybe "open the door" instead of "open door north"? Or perhaps "unlock the door"? But the system might only accept specific commands. Since the previous attempt to "open door north" didn't work, maybe the correct command is "open the door north" without the "door" part? Or maybe "open north door"?

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use a synonym like "unblock" or "remove the block" from the door. But the system's response suggests that the user is stuck in a loop, so the next action should be a different command. The key is to break the loop by using a different action that the system recognizes as valid. So, instead of "open door north", maybe "open north" or "unblock door north"? But the system might not recognize those. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "go north" again, but that's what they tried before. Wait, the initial instruction was to open the door first, then go north. So the correct sequence is open the door, then go north. But the user is getting stuck because the system keeps saying they need to open the door first. So the next action should be to open the door again, but using a different phrasing. Maybe "open the door north" instead of "open door north"? Or perhaps "open the north door"? The system might accept that. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "unblock the door" or "push the door open". But the system's previous response only recognized "open door north" as the action. So perhaps the correct next step is to try "open the door north" again, but the system is not accepting it. Wait, the user tried "open door north" and the system said "I only understood you as far as wanting to open door." So maybe the system is not recognizing "door north" as a valid command. So the user needs to use a different command, like "open the north door" or "unblock the door north". Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "go north" after opening the door. But the system is preventing that until the door is open. So the next action should be to open the door, but using a different command. The user's previous attempts were "go north" and "open door north", but the system is not accepting "open door north". So maybe the correct command is "open the door north" with the article "the". Let me check the previous responses. The user tried "open door north" and the system said "I only understood you as far as wanting to open door." So maybe the system is expecting "open the door north" instead. Therefore, the next action should be "open the door north" to correctly open the door. Then, after that, go north. So the next step is to open the door again, using the correct phrasing.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is stuck in a loop where they keep trying to open the north door but the system isn't recognizing their commands. The goal is to open the door, go north, then east, etc., and pick up the mop.

First, the goal steps are: open the north door, then go north, east, etc. But the user is repeatedly trying to open the door and the system isn't accepting the correct phrasing. Previous attempts were "open door north" and "open the door north", but the system only understood "open door" part. Then the user tried "open the north door", which the system misunderstood as "open north".

So, the next step is to find a different way to phrase the command. Maybe "unblock the door" or "push the door open"? But the system might not recognize those. Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "open the north door" but the system is expecting "open door north". Wait, the user tried "open the door north" and the system said "I only understood you as far as wanting to open door." So maybe the system is expecting "open the door" without specifying north. But the door is north, so perhaps the correct command is "open the door" and then "go north". But the initial instruction says to open the door first. So maybe the user needs to first open the door, then go north. But the system is not allowing that until the door is open. So the next action should be to open the door again, but using a different phrasing. Maybe "unblock the door north"? Or "open the north door"? The system might be expecting "open the door north" with the article. But the user tried that and it didn't work. So perhaps the correct command is "open the door" and then "go north". But the system might not accept that. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "go north" after opening the door. But the door is closed, so they can't. Therefore, the next action should be to open the door using a different command that the system recognizes. The user's previous attempts were "open door north", "open the door north", "open the north door". The system is not recognizing "north" in those commands. So maybe the correct command is "open the door" and then "go north". But the system might not allow going north until the door is open. So the next action is to open the door again, but using the correct phrasing. The answer should be "open the door north" but the system isn't accepting it. Therefore, the user needs to try a different synonym. Maybe "unblock the door north"? But the system might not recognize that. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "go north" after opening the door. But the door is closed. So the next action is to open the door again, but the system is not recognizing it. Therefore, the correct next step is to use a different command, like "unblock the door north".

Okay, let's tackle this. The user is stuck in a loop where they can't get the door to open. The goal is to open the door north first, then go north, east, etc. But every time they try to open the door, the system only recognizes "open door" and not "open door north". They've tried several variations like "open the door north", "open the north door", but the system isn't accepting them. The key is to find a command that the system does recognize. Since "open door north" isn't working, maybe the correct command is just "open door" and then "go north". But the system might not allow moving north until the door is open. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use a different verb like "unblock" or "push". But the system only recognizes "open" as the verb. So the next step is to try "open door" without specifying north, but that might not work. Wait, the initial instruction said the door is closed and leads north. So maybe the correct command is "open the door" and then "go north". But the system is preventing movement until the door is open. So the user needs to open the door first. The problem is that the system isn't recognizing "open door north". Therefore, the next action should be "open the door" and hope that it works, even though the system might not accept it. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "go north" after opening the door, but the door is closed. So the correct next step is to try "open the door" again, even though the system says it's only understanding "open door". Maybe the system expects "open the door" with the article. So the answer is "open the door".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to win the game by following specific steps. The goal is to open the door in the workshop, then go north, east, etc., and pick up the mop. So far, the user opened the door and went north to the pantry, then east to the cookhouse. Now, the next steps would be to continue moving east or north, but the current location is the cookhouse.

In the cookhouse, there's an open hatch north and a stone passageway west. The user needs to follow the path to reach the laundry place where the mop is. The previous steps were going east from the pantry, then east again to the cookhouse. Now, from the cookhouse, the next logical step is to go north through the hatch. But the user might have to check if that's the correct direction. Alternatively, maybe the stone passageway west is part of the path. However, the initial instructions mention going east after going north, so perhaps the correct path is north from the cookhouse. The user needs to go north through the hatch to continue the journey. So the next action should be "go north".

Ah, the cellar. This is some kind of cellar, really great ordinary vibes in this place, a wonderful ordinary atmosphere. The room is well lit.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

There is an open gate leading north. There is an open hatch leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is trying to follow the steps to win the game. The goal is to open the door in the workshop, then go north, east, etc., and pick up the mop. So far, the user has opened the door, gone north to the pantry, east to the cookhouse, north to the cellar, west to the office. Now, in the office, the next steps would be to go east or north. The current location is the office, which has an exit to the north and east. The user needs to continue moving towards the laundry place where the mop is. The previous steps were going east from the pantry, then east again to the cookhouse, then north to the cellar, west to the office. Now, from the office, the next logical step is to go east to continue the path. The user should check if going east is the correct direction. The office has an exit to the east, so the next action is "go east".

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Cellar and Office. The goal is to pick up the mop in the laundry place. So far, the user has been going back and forth between these areas. The next step should be to find a way to proceed towards the laundry place. The previous actions were going west and east, which are leading them in circles. The user needs to break the loop by trying a different direction. The Office has an exit to the north, so maybe going north from the Office is the way to go. Alternatively, the Cellar has a gate north and a hatch south. But the user needs to avoid the loop. The correct path should be to go north from the Office to continue towards the laundry place. So the next action is "go north".

Okay, the user is in the Laundromat and needs to find the mop. They've tried "take mop" and "look around" multiple times, but the game isn't recognizing the mop. The goal is to pick up the mop from the laundry place. Maybe the mop is in a location that's not immediately visible. The user should check all possible areas. The Laundromat has an open portal east, gate south, and passageway west. Perhaps the mop is in one of those directions. The next step is to explore these areas. The user should try moving in a different direction, like east, to find the mop.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.
