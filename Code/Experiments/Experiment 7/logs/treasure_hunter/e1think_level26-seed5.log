Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. Your first objective is to make an effort to go east. After that, attempt to go to the north. Then, make an effort to head north. And then, attempt to take a trip west. And then, travel north. And then, head east. With that done, go east. And then, make an attempt to take a trip east. And then, attempt to go to the south. And then, go to the south. Then, make an effort to head west. Next, lift the gummy bear from the floor of the chamber. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Cubicle =-
You are in a cubicle. A typical kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

An open typical looking coffer is right there by you. The coffer is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You see a cabinet. You can see a chair. The chair is ordinary. However, the chair, like an empty chair, has nothing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You can see a bookshelf. The bookshelf is normal. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. This always happens! You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to a stand. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

You find yourself in a launderette. A typical one. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

You can make out a shelf. The shelf is normal. But the thing is empty.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user wants me to figure out the next action in the TextWorld game. The goal is to follow a specific sequence of directions and then pick up the gummy bear.

First, I need to recall the exact steps mentioned. The user's objective is to go east, then north, then north again, west, north, east, east, south, south, west, then lift the gummy bear. But the current location is the Launderette. Let me check the steps taken so far.

The user started in the Cubicle, went east to the Launderette. Then, the next steps in the original instruction were to attempt to go north, then north again, then west, etc. But in the current state, the user is in the Launderette. The available exits here are east, north, and west. The previous action was "go east" from the Cubicle to the Launderette. Now, the next step according to the original plan was to attempt to go north. But the user has to follow the sequence: after going east, go north, then north again, then west, etc.

Wait, the user's instructions say: after going east, attempt to go north. Then make an effort to head north again. Then attempt to take a trip west. Then travel north. Then head east. Then go east again. Then attempt to go south. Then go south again. Then make an effort to head west. Then lift the gummy bear.

So in the current state, the user is in the Launderette. The previous action was going east from the Cubicle. Now, the next step is to go north from the Launderette. But the user has to check if that's possible. The Launderette's exits include north, so "go north" should be possible. However, the user might be in a loop if they keep moving in the same directions. But according to the steps, after going east, the next is north. So the next action should be "go north".

-= Canteen =-
You arrive in a canteen. A normal kind of place. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."

You can see an opened chest. What a letdown! The chest is empty! Hey, want to see a bowl? Look over there, a bowl. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in a text adventure game. The goal is to follow a specific sequence of directions and then pick up the gummy bear.

First, the initial steps were going east, then north, then north again, west, north, east, east, south, south, west, and finally pick up the gummy bear. But the user is getting stuck in a loop between the cubicle, launderette, and canteen. 

Looking at the current room, the canteen has exits to east, north, south, and west. The previous actions were going east, north, north, west, north, east, east, south, south, west. But the user is now in the canteen again, which might mean they're repeating the same path.

The next step after the canteen would be to go west again, but that's already been done. Alternatively, maybe trying a different direction like south or east. But the user needs to follow the exact steps given. The next step in the original plan was to go west, then pick up the gummy bear. However, the user is in the canteen, so maybe they need to go west from here. But the user might be looping between rooms without progressing towards the gummy bear. 

Wait, the original instructions say after going west, travel north, then east, then east, south, south, west, then pick up the gummy bear. So after the canteen, the next step should be west again. But the user is in the canteen, so going west would take them back to the launderette. Then from there, maybe north to the cubicle again. But that's not helping. Maybe the user needs to find a different path. Alternatively, maybe the gummy bear is in a different location, and the user needs to navigate correctly. 

But according to the problem, the user has to follow the exact sequence. The next step after the canteen is to go west, then go south, then west again. But the user is in the canteen, so going west would take them to the launderette. Then from there, maybe south to the cubicle, then east to the launderette again. This seems like a loop. 

The user needs to break the loop by trying a different direction. Maybe instead of going west, they should go south from the canteen. But the original plan says after going west, travel north. So perhaps the user is following the steps correctly but getting stuck in a loop because the rooms are connected in a way that repeats. 

Alternatively, maybe the gummy bear is in the canteen, but the user hasn't checked the items. The canteen has an opened chest and a bowl, but they are empty. The user needs to check if the gummy bear is in one of these items, but the problem states that the gummy bear is on the floor. So the user needs to move to the correct room where the gummy bear is. 

But according to the initial description, the cubicle has the gummy bear. Wait, the original problem says: "lift the gummy bear from the floor of the chamber." So the gummy bear is in the cubicle. But the user has already gone east from the cubicle to the launderette, then north to the canteen. So maybe the user needs to go back to the cubicle via the west exit from the canteen. 

So the next step is to go west from the canteen to the launderette, then west again to the cubicle. Then pick up the gummy bear. But the user is in the canteen, so the next action should be west. However, the user might be repeating the same steps, leading to a loop. 

The user's previous actions were: go east (cubicle -> launderette), go north (launderette -> canteen), go north again (canteen -> ?), but the canteen has exits to north, south, east, west. So from the canteen, going north would take them to another room, but the user hasn't explored that yet. 

Wait, the user's current position is the canteen. The next step in the original plan was to go west, then north, then east, etc. So from the canteen, go west to the launderette, then north to the cubicle. Then pick up the gummy bear. But the user is in the canteen, so the next action is west. However, the user might be stuck in a loop if they keep going back and forth. 

Therefore, the correct next action is to go west from the canteen to the launderette, then north to the cubicle. But the user is in the canteen, so the next command is west.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in a text adventure game. The goal is to follow a specific sequence of directions and then pick up a gummy bear.

First, I need to recall the initial instructions. The user had to go east, then north, then north again, west, north, east, east, south, south, west, then lift the gummy bear. But so far, the user has gone east from the cubicle to the launderette, then north to the canteen, then west to the bar. Now they're in the bar. 

Looking at the current room (the bar), the exits are east, north, and south. The previous steps have already covered going east, north, west, etc. But the next step in the original plan was to go south from the canteen, but the user went west instead. Now, in the bar, the next step might be to go south again. However, the user needs to check if they're following the correct sequence.

Wait, the original steps after the canteen were to go south. But the user went west from the canteen to the bar. Now, in the bar, the exit to the south is unguarded. So maybe the next step is to go south from the bar. But the user needs to make sure they're not looping. Let me check the steps again.

The user's path so far: Cubicle (east) → Launderette (north) → Canteen (west) → Bar. Now, from the bar, the next step in the original plan was to go south (after the canteen's south exit). But the user is in the bar now. The original plan after the canteen was to go south, but the user went west. So maybe the user is off track. However, the instructions say to follow the sequence: after going west (from canteen to bar), the next step was to travel north. Wait, the original steps were: go east, north, north, west, north, east, east, south, south, west, then pick up the gummy bear.

Wait, the user's current position is the bar. The previous steps were: cubicle east, launderette north, canteen west (to bar). Now, from the bar, the next step in the original plan was to go north (as per the initial instructions: after going west, travel north). But in the bar, the exits are east, north, south. So going north from the bar would be the next step. But the user needs to check if that's part of the sequence.

Alternatively, maybe the user is in a loop. Let me retrace. The initial steps were: go east, north, north, west, north, east, east, south, south, west. So after the bar, the next step would be north. But the user is in the bar, so going north from there. However, the user might have already done some steps. Wait, the user's current position is the bar, which is after going west from the canteen. The original plan after going west (from canteen) was to go north. So from the bar, the next step is north. But the user needs to make sure that's the correct direction. The bar's north exit is unguarded, so that's allowed. So the next action should be go north. But the user might be in a loop if they keep going back. However, the instructions say to follow the sequence, so the next step is north. But the user's previous action was going west, so the next step is north. Therefore, the correct command is go north.

But so far, the user has moved through Cubicle → Launderette → Canteen → Bar → Office. Let me check the steps they've taken:

1. Start in Cubicle, go east to Launderette.
2. From Launderette, go north to Canteen.
3. From Canteen, go west to Bar.
4. From Bar, go north to Office.

Wait, the original plan was to go east, then north, then north, west, north, east, east, south, south, west. But the user's path so far is east (Cubicle to Launderette), then north (to Canteen), then west (to Bar), then north (to Office). So they've done east, north, west, north. The next steps in the original plan were east, then east, south, south, west. But the user is now in the Office. Let me check the current room: Office has exits to east (unguarded), north (unguarded), south (unblocked). The user needs to go east again? Or maybe another direction?

Wait, the original steps after the initial movements were: after going east, north, north, west, north, east, east, south, south, west. So after the first four steps (east, north, north, west), the next was north again. But in the current state, the user is in the Office, which has a north exit. So maybe the next step is to go north again from Office? But the user already went north from Bar to Office. Wait, the original plan says after going west (from Canteen to Bar), then go north (to Office), then east, east, south, south, west. So from Office, the next step should be east. Let me check the Office's exits: east is unguarded, so go east. Then from there, maybe another east, then south, etc. But the user is at Office now. So the next step should be east. But the user's previous action was go north to Office. So the next step is to go east from Office. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next command should be go east. But the user's last action was go north. So the next step is go east. But the user is in the Office, and the exit to the east is unguarded. So the correct next action is go east. However, the user might be in a loop if they keep going back and forth. But according to the steps, they need to go east from Office. So the next command is go east.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in this text adventure game. The goal is to follow a specific sequence of directions and then pick up the gummy bear.

First, I need to recall the exact steps mentioned in the initial instruction. The user has to go east, then north, then north again, west, north, east, east again, south, south, west, pick up the gummy bear, and then win. So far, the user has moved through Cubicle → Launderette → Canteen → Bar → Office → Dish-Pit. Let me check the path:

1. Start in Cubicle, go east to Launderette.
2. From Launderette, go north to Canteen.
3. From Canteen, go west to Bar.
4. From Bar, go north to Office.
5. From Office, go east to Dish-Pit.

Now, the next steps in the original plan are: after Dish-Pit, the user needs to go east again, then south, then west, then pick up the gummy bear. But the current room is Dish-Pit. Let's check the exits here. The Dish-Pit has exits to east, north, south, west. The next step according to the plan is to go east from Dish-Pit. But wait, the user might be looping here if they keep going back and forth. However, the instruction says to go east again, so the next action should be east. But the user has to make sure they don't get stuck in a loop. However, the current room is Dish-Pit, and the next step is to go east. Let me confirm the steps again.

The user's past actions so far have covered the first few directions. The next step in the sequence is to go east again from Dish-Pit. Then, after that, go south, then west, then pick up the gummy bear. So the immediate next action is to go east. But I need to check if going east from Dish-Pit is possible. The Dish-Pit's exit to the east is unblocked, so that's allowed. Therefore, the next command should be "go east".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in a text adventure game. The goal is to follow a specific sequence of directions and eventually pick up the gummy bear.

First, I need to recap the game's objective. The user has to go east, then north, then north again, west, north, east, east again, south, south, west, pick up the gummy bear, and then win. So far, the user has moved through several rooms: Cubicle → Launderette → Canteen → Bar → Office → Dish-Pit → Kitchenette. 

Looking at the current room, the Kitchenette has exits to the east, south, and west. The previous actions have been going east multiple times, but maybe there's a loop here. The user needs to make sure they're not repeating the same direction without progress. 

In the Kitchenette, the exit to the east is unblocked. But the user might be stuck in a loop if they keep going east without progressing towards the gummy bear. However, the next step in the objective is to go south after some east movements. The user has already gone east once here, so maybe the next step is to go south as per the plan. 

Wait, the user's next step according to the original plan was after going east again, then south. But in the current room, the exits are east, south, and west. The user needs to go south next. But the previous action was going east, so maybe the next command should be south. However, the user's last action was "go east", so they need to check if that's the correct next step. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is in a loop between rooms, so they need to try a different direction. But the objective says after going east, go south. So the next action should be south. But the user is in the Kitchenette, which has a south exit. So the correct next step is to go south. 

But the user's previous action was "go east", so the next step should be "go south" as per the plan. However, the user might be repeating actions, so I need to make sure they're following the sequence correctly. The next step in the plan is to go south after the east movements. So the next command should be "go south".

THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user's goal is to follow a specific sequence of movements and then pick up the gummy bear. So far, they've moved east, north, west, east, north, east, south, and now they're in the Chamber. The next steps according to the original instructions are to go east again, then south, then west, and finally pick up the gummy bear.

Wait, the user is in the Chamber now. The previous action was going south, which led them here. The Chamber has an exit to the east, north, and west. The gummy bear is on the floor. The next step in the sequence is to go east again. But the user needs to lift the gummy bear after moving around. Let me check the steps again.

The original plan was: go east, north, north, west, north, east, east, south, south, west, then pick up the gummy bear. But maybe the exact steps are a bit different. The key is that after moving around, the user needs to pick up the gummy bear. Since the user is in the Chamber now, the next action should be to pick up the gummy bear. But the instructions say to make an effort to go east, then south, then west, then lift the gummy bear. Wait, the exact steps from the user's message are:

After going east, north, north, west, north, east, east, south, south, west, then lift the gummy bear. But in the current state, the user is in the Chamber, which is the last step before lifting the gummy bear. So the next action should be to pick up the gummy bear. But the user's previous action was going south, leading to the Chamber. Now, the next step is to lift the gummy bear. However, the game might require moving around first. Wait, the original instructions say: "Next, lift the gummy bear from the floor of the chamber. And once you've done that, you win!" So the final step is to pick it up. But the user is already in the Chamber, so the next action is to take the gummy bear. But the system message says to output only the command. So the correct next action is to take the gummy bear. But the user's previous actions have already followed the movement steps, so now it's time to pick it up.
