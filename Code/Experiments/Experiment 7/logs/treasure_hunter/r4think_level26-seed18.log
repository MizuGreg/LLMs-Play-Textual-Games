You are now playing a exciting round of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to make an effort to go to the east. Following that, ensure that the oak door is open. After you have opened the oak door, attempt to travel north. And then, make an effort to take a trip west. And then, retrieve the fresh laundry scented key from the floor of the shower. After that, look and see that the fresh laundry scented door is unlocked with the fresh laundry scented key. Then, ensure that the fresh laundry scented door within the shower is open. After that, make an attempt to move north. Then, try to go to the east. With that done, ensure that the portal inside the studio is open. After that, travel north. Then, lift the latchkey from the floor of the cubicle. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

Guess what, you are in the place we're calling the cookhouse.

There is an open wooden gateway leading east. There is an open door leading west.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out the next steps here. The user's goal is to follow a series of specific actions in the text-based game. So far, they've started by going east from the cookhouse, then opened the oak door in the closet, went north to the serious studio. Now, the next step according to the initial instructions was to travel north from the studio. But when they tried that, they ended up in the studio, and the next step was to go east. Wait, but the user's last action was going north from the studio, which might not be correct.

Wait, looking back at the user's history: After entering the Serious Studio, the next step was to go north, but the user's last action was "go north" which led them to the studio. Wait, maybe I need to check the exact steps again. The original plan was: go east, open oak door, go north, then go west, retrieve the key, etc. But in the current state, the user is in the Serious Studio. The next step in the original plan was after entering the studio to travel north, then go east, then open the portal. But maybe the user is stuck in a loop here.

Wait, the user's current location is the Serious Studio. The next step according to the initial instructions was to travel north from the studio. But when they tried that, they might have ended up in a place they've already been. Let me check the previous steps again. The user went east from cookhouse, then opened the oak door (closet), went north to the studio. Now, in the studio, the next step was to go north, but maybe that's not possible. The studio has an open oak door south and an open wooden door west. So going north from the studio isn't an option. Wait, the user's instruction said after entering the studio, they should travel north. But according to the current description, the studio has a door south and west. So perhaps the user made a mistake here. Maybe the next step after the studio is to go west, but the original plan said after the studio, go north. Hmm, this is confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the user is in a loop between the studio and the closet. Let me check the previous steps again. The user went east from cookhouse (to closet), opened the oak door (so now in the closet, then went north to the studio). Now, in the studio, the next step was to go north, but that's not possible. So maybe the user needs to go west from the studio instead. But according to the original plan, after entering the studio, they should go north. But if that's not possible, maybe the user needs to adjust their approach. Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go west from the studio to the cubicle, then retrieve the latchkey. Wait, the original plan said after the studio, lift the latchkey from the cubicle. But the user hasn't done that yet.

Wait, the user's current location is the Serious Studio. The next step in the original plan was to travel north from the studio, but that's not possible. So maybe the user needs to go west from the studio to the cubicle. But the original plan said after the studio, go north. So perhaps the user is in a loop here. Therefore, the user needs to find a different action, maybe using a synonym for "go north" if that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe the user should go west from the studio to the cubicle, then lift the latchkey. But according to the original plan, after the studio, the next step was to go north, then east, then open the portal. But if that's not possible, the user needs to adjust.

So the user's next action should be to go west from the studio to the cubicle, then retrieve the latchkey. But according to the original plan, after the studio, they should go north. However, since that's not possible, the user needs to go west instead. Therefore, the correct next action is to go west from the studio.

You arrive in a shower. A normal kind of place. You begin looking for stuff.

As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a table. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is a closed fresh laundry scented door leading north. There is an open wooden door leading east.

There is a fresh laundry scented key on the floor.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to follow a specific sequence of actions in the text game. So far, they've gone east from the cookhouse, opened the oak door in the closet, went north to the studio, then went west to the shower. In the shower, they picked up the fresh laundry key and tried to open the door. The error message says they need to unlock the door with the key, but the previous attempt used "open" which wasn't recognized. The correct action should be to use the key on the door.

Looking at the steps again: after retrieving the key, the next step is to unlock the door. The user tried "open" but got an error. The correct verb here is "unlock". So the next action should be "unlock fresh laundry scented door". That's the correct command. The user was in a loop because they kept trying to open the door without using the right verb. Now, using "unlock" should proceed.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in the text game. The current goal is to unlock the fresh laundry scented door in the shower. They tried using "unlock" but got a message saying it's already unlocked. Wait, but the previous step was unlocking it, so maybe the door is now open. The next step in the original plan was to ensure the door is open, then move north. But the game is saying they need to open it again. Maybe there's a loop here because the door is already open, but the game isn't recognizing it. The user needs to find a different action, maybe "open" instead of "unlock" even though the door is already unlocked. Alternatively, maybe the correct action is to "open" the door again. Since the previous attempt to "unlock" didn't work, perhaps the correct verb is "open". So the next action should be "open fresh laundry scented door".

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to follow a specific sequence of actions in the text game. So far, they've gone through several rooms: cookhouse, closet, serious studio, shower, and now the workshop and salon. The next step in the original plan was to ensure the portal in the studio is open, but the user might have missed that. Wait, the original plan mentioned after the shower, they needed to go north again, then east, then open the portal. But in the current state, they're in the salon. Hmm, maybe the user needs to go back to the studio to open the portal. But the current location is the salon, which has exits to south and west. The next step might be to go west from the salon to the workshop, then find the portal. Alternatively, maybe the portal is in the studio, so they need to go back to the studio via the workshop. The user might be stuck in a loop between the salon and workshop. The correct action would be to go west from the salon to the workshop, then check the studio's portal. But the original plan said after the shower, go north to the studio, then east, then open the portal. So perhaps the user needs to go back to the studio via the workshop and then proceed to open the portal there. The next command should be "go west" from the salon to the workshop.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Serious Workshop and Laundry Place. They keep going back and forth between these rooms. The goal is to open the portal in the studio. The previous steps didn't mention checking the studio's portal, so maybe the user needs to find another way to reach it. The correct action here is to go east from the workshop to the salon again, then check the studio's portal. But since the user is in the workshop, the next step should be to go east to exit the workshop and proceed to the salon. However, the user might need to find the portal in the studio through another route. The next command should be "go east" to move towards the salon and check the studio's portal.

You find yourself in a workshop. A serious one. The room is well lit.

You can make out a mantle. The mantle is typical. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

You've walked into a normal room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be normal. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the workshop. Let's see what's in here.



There is an open fresh laundry scented door leading south. There is an open gateway leading east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

-= Workshop =-
You've walked into a normal room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be normal. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the workshop. Let's see what's in here.



There is an open fresh laundry scented door leading south. There is an open gateway leading east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

-= Salon =-
You've entered a salon. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

Hey, want to see a bed stand? Look over there, a bed stand. On the bed stand you make out a fondue. You can see a bench. But the thing is empty. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.
