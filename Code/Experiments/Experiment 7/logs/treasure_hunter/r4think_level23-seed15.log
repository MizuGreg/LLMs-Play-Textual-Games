I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to travel west. With that accomplished, make an effort to travel north. And then, travel north. Then, go north. And then, try to head east. After that, make an attempt to venture north. Next, retrieve the loaf of bread from the floor of the dish-pit. That's it!

-= Bedchamber =-
You arrive in a bedchamber. A typical one. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a bookshelf. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a bar. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

-= Washroom =-
You arrive in a washroom. An usual kind of place. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You can see a bench. On the bench you can make out a latchkey.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Kitchen =-
Well, here we are in the kitchen. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a rack. The rack is typical. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You can make out a platter. The platter is normal. But the thing is empty. Hm. Oh well

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

-= Cookery =-
You've entered a cookery.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user wants me to figure out the next action in this TextWorld game. Let me start by recalling the goal. The original instruction was to go west, then north three times, then east, then north again, and finally retrieve the loaf of bread from the dish-pit.

So far, the user has gone west from the Bedchamber to the Washroom, then north to the Kitchen, then north again to the Cookery. Now, the next step according to the original plan was to go east from the Cookery. But the current room is Cookery, and the exits are east, north, and south. The user's last action was "go north" which took them to Cookery. Wait, no, the previous steps were: Bedchamber -> Washroom (west), then north to Kitchen, then north again to Cookery. So the next step in the original plan was to go east from Cookery. But the user hasn't done that yet. However, the current room is Cookery, and the available exits are east, north, south. The user needs to go east next. But maybe there's a loop here? Let me check the rooms again.

In the Cookery room, the description says: "You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked." So east is an option. The original plan was to go east from Cookery. But maybe the user is stuck in a loop? Let me check the previous steps again. The user went west, then north, then north again. So from Bedchamber (west to Washroom, north to Kitchen, north to Cookery). Now, the next step is east. But maybe the user tried going north again? Wait, the user's last action was "go north" which led to Cookery. So the next step is to go east. But perhaps the user is in a loop between Cookery and another room? Let me think. The original plan was to go east from Cookery, then north again, then get the bread. But maybe the user is not progressing. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to find the dish-pit where the bread is. The bread is in the dish-pit, which is probably in the Kitchen or another room. Wait, the user was in the Kitchen earlier, where there was a platter and a rack, but they were empty. The bread is in the dish-pit. So maybe the user needs to go back south from Cookery to Kitchen, then find the dish-pit. But the original plan was to go east from Cookery. Let me check the original steps again. The user's instructions were: go west, then north, then north, then north, then east, then north, then get the bread. Wait, the original plan was: after going west, go north three times, then east, then north, then get the bread. So after Cookery, the next step is east. But maybe the user is in a loop because going east from Cookery leads to another room. Let me think: the user is in Cookery, and the exits are east, north, south. If they go east, what's next? The original plan was to go east, then north. But maybe the user is stuck in a loop between Cookery and another room. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go south from Cookery back to Kitchen, then find the dish-pit. But the original plan was to go east. However, the user might be in a loop if going east doesn't lead to progress. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go north from Cookery again. Wait, the user's last action was "go north" to Cookery. So the next step is to go east. But perhaps the user is in a loop between Cookery and another room. Let me check the possible rooms. The user has been in Bedchamber, Washroom, Kitchen, Cookery. The next step is east from Cookery. Let's assume that going east from Cookery leads to a room where the dish-pit is. But the original plan was to go east, then north, then get the bread. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go south from Cookery back to Kitchen, then find the dish-pit. But the original plan was to go east. However, the user might be stuck in a loop if going east doesn't lead to the dish-pit. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go north again from Cookery. But the original plan was to go east. So the correct next step is to go east. But the user might have already done that. Wait, the user's last action was "go north" to Cookery. So the next step is to go east. So the answer should be "go east".

You have walked into a canteen. Not the canteen you'd expect. No, this is a canteen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You see an opened freezer in the corner. What a letdown! The freezer is empty!

There is an open gate leading east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.
