I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to travel west. With that accomplished, make an effort to travel north. And then, travel north. Then, go north. And then, try to head east. After that, make an attempt to venture north. Next, retrieve the loaf of bread from the floor of the dish-pit. That's it!

-= Bedchamber =-
You arrive in a bedchamber. A typical one. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a bookshelf. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a bar. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

-= Washroom =-
You arrive in a washroom. An usual kind of place. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You can see a bench. On the bench you can make out a latchkey.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Kitchen =-
Well, here we are in the kitchen. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a rack. The rack is typical. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You can make out a platter. The platter is normal. But the thing is empty. Hm. Oh well
