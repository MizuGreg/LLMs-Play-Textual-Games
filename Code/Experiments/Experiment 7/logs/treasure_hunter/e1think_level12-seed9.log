Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First step, make an attempt to go to the west. Then, try to take a trip north. And then, recover the poem from the floor of the bedchamber. Alright, thanks!

-= Sauna =-
You find yourself in a sauna. A typical one.



There is an open passageway leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

There is a sponge on the floor.

-= Spare Room =-
You are in a spare room. A typical one.

You can make out an opened ordinary looking cabinet in the corner. The cabinet is empty, what a horrible day!

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text-based game where they need to follow specific steps to achieve the goal. The initial instructions were to go west, then north, and recover the poem from the bedchamber. 

First, the user started by going west, which took them from the sauna to the spare room. Now, they're in the spare room. The next step according to the original plan was to go north. But the current room's description mentions an exit to the north, so maybe that's the next move. However, the user might be stuck in a loop if they keep going back and forth between rooms.

Looking at the environment, the spare room has a cabinet that's empty. The original goal was to recover a poem from the bedchamber. But the current location is the spare room. The user needs to find a way to reach the bedchamber. Maybe the bedchamber is north from the spare room? The previous step was going west from the sauna, then to the spare room. The next logical step would be to go north from the spare room. But if that leads back to the sauna, then maybe there's a different path. Alternatively, maybe the bedchamber is accessible through another door or object in the spare room. However, the cabinet is empty, so perhaps there's no item there. The user needs to check if going north from the spare room leads to the bedchamber. If not, maybe they need to explore east or look for another exit. But the current description says there's an exit to the north. So the next step should be to go north. But if that's part of a loop, maybe the user needs to try a different action, like looking for items or using a synonym for the direction. However, the instructions say to not repeat the same action if it's not progressing. Since the user is in the spare room and the next step is to go north, that's the logical next move. So the answer should be "go north".
</think>go north

-= Bedchamber =-
You find yourself in a bedchamber. An usual kind of place.



There is an unblocked exit to the east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

There is a poem on the floor.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through these different rooms and recover the poem from the bedchamber. The goal is to follow the steps given: first go west, then north, then recover the poem.

So far, the user started by going west, which took them from the sauna to the spare room. Then they went north from the spare room to the bedchamber. Now, in the bedchamber, there's a poem on the floor. The next step should be to pick up the poem. But the command needs to be a short action. The poem is on the floor, so the correct action would be to take the poem. Let me check if there's any other step needed. The user has already gone west and north as per the initial instructions, so the final step is to retrieve the poem. The answer should be "take poem" or something similar. But the system might expect "take the poem" or just "take poem". Since the previous commands were "go west" and "go north", the next logical step is to take the poem. So the next action is "take poem".
</think>take poem
