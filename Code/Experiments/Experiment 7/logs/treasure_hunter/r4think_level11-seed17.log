Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, make an attempt to go north. If you can accomplish that, retrieve the potato from the floor of the salon. Alright, thanks!

-= Studio =-
You arrive in a studio. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."

A closed suitcase is close by. You make out a coffer.

There is an open door leading north. There is an open portal leading south.

go north

-= Salon =-
Guess what, you are in the place we're calling the salon.

You make out a bookshelf. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

There is an open gate leading east. There is an open door leading south.

There is a potato on the floor.

That's not a verb I recognise.
