I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! First step, make an attempt to take a trip west. And then, go to the south. Okay, and then, open the passageway. And then, go south. And then, travel west. And then, attempt to venture north. Then, retrieve the poem from the floor of the bedchamber. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Studio =-
You are in an usual kind of place. That is to say, you're in a studio.

You can make out a stand. The stand is normal. However, the stand, like an empty stand, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is an open gateway leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a TextWorld game, and their goal is to follow a series of steps to retrieve the poem from the bedchamber and then stop. So far, they've gone west from the studio into the attic. The current location is the attic, which has a suitcase, a locker, a display, and exits east, north, and south.

First, I need to recall the original instructions. The user was told to: go west, then south, open the passageway, go south again, travel west, venture north, retrieve the poem from the bedchamber, and then stop. But in the current state, they're in the attic. Let me check where the bedchamber is. The original studio had a west exit leading to the attic. The attic has a north exit (hatch) and a south exit (door). The next steps mentioned were after going west, then south, open the passageway, etc. But maybe the bedchamber is further north or south?

Wait, the user's current location is the attic. The next step in their plan was after going west (to attic), then go south. So from the attic, going south would take them back to the studio? But the studio's south exit isn't mentioned. Wait, the studio's description says there's an open gateway west and a north entrance. The attic's south exit is a door. So going south from the attic would take them back to the studio. But the user's plan was to go south from the studio, then open the passageway, then south again, west, north, etc. Maybe the passageway is in the attic? Or perhaps the bedchamber is in a different area.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go north from the attic. The attic has a north hatch. Going north from the attic might lead to another area. The original plan was to go west, then south, open the passageway, then south again, west, north, retrieve the poem. So perhaps after going west to the attic, the next step is to go south back to the studio, then open the passageway (maybe a door or something in the studio?), then go south again, west, north, etc.

But the user is in the attic now. The next step according to their plan was after going west (to attic), then go south. So from the attic, go south to the studio. Then, open the passageway. But the studio's description mentions a stand, but no passageway. Maybe the passageway is in the attic? Or perhaps the user needs to open a hatch or door in the attic. The attic has a north hatch. Maybe that's the passageway. So after going south to the studio, then perhaps go north again to the attic, but that might loop. Alternatively, maybe the passageway is in the attic's north hatch. So the user needs to open that.

But the user's current location is the attic. The next step in their plan was to go south from the studio, but they are now in the attic. So maybe the next step is to go south from the attic back to the studio. Then, from the studio, go north (as per the original plan). But the studio's north is unguarded. So maybe that's where the passageway is. Wait, the original plan said after going west, go south, open the passageway, then go south again. So maybe the passageway is in the studio's north direction. But the studio's north is unguarded. So perhaps the user needs to go north from the studio to open the passageway. But the user is in the attic now. So the next step is to go south from the attic to the studio, then go north from the studio to the passageway. Then, from there, go south again, west, north, etc.

But the user's current action is in the attic. The next step is to go south to the studio. Then, from the studio, go north. But the studio's north is unguarded. So maybe that's the passageway. Then, from there, go south again, west, etc. So the user needs to go south from the attic to the studio, then north to the passageway. But the user is in the attic, so the next action is to go south. However, the user's previous action was go west, then they are in the attic. The next step in the plan is to go south from the studio, but they are in the attic now. So the user needs to go south from the attic to the studio, then proceed as per the plan.

But the user's current location is the attic. The next step in the plan is to go south (from the studio), but they are in the attic. So the correct next action is to go south from the attic to the studio. Then, from the studio, go north (as per the plan). But the user is in the attic, so the next action is to go south. However, the user might be in a loop if they keep going back and forth. But according to the plan, after going west (to attic), go south (to studio), then open the passageway. So the user needs to go south from the attic to the studio, then open the passageway. The passageway might be in the studio's north direction. So the next action is to go south from the attic.

-= Basement =-
You're now in the basement. Let's see what's in here.

You can make out a locked chest. You see a safe. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You make out a shelf. The shelf is normal. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is a closed passageway leading south. There is an open door leading north. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text-based game where they need to follow a series of steps to achieve the goal. The goal mentioned earlier was to go west, then south, open a passageway, go south again, west, north, retrieve the poem from the bedchamber, and then stop.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the basement. The previous actions were going west from the studio to the attic, then south to the basement. Now, the next step according to the initial plan was to open the passageway. But in the basement, there's a closed passageway leading south. The user needs to open it. However, the user's last action was "go south", which might have led them to the basement. Now, they need to find a way to open the passageway. The problem is that the user might be stuck in a loop if they keep going south again. So, the next step should be to check if there's a way to open the passageway. But the user needs to use the correct command. Since the passageway is closed, they might need to use a key or another item. However, in the basement, there's a locked chest and a safe. Maybe the key is in there. But the user hasn't interacted with those yet. Alternatively, the user might need to find a way to open the passageway directly. The next action should be to try opening the passageway. But the command might be "open passageway" or "open the passageway". However, the game might require a different phrasing. Alternatively, since the user is in the basement, maybe they need to check the locked chest first. But the initial plan was to open the passageway. So, the correct next step is to open the passageway. But the user might have already tried that. Wait, in the basement description, the passageway is closed. So the user needs to open it. The correct command would be "open passageway". But the user's previous action was "go south", which might have led them here. So the next step is to open the passageway. However, if the user is in a loop, they need to find another way. But according to the current state, the user is in the basement, and the passageway is closed. So the next action should be to open it. Therefore, the answer is "open passageway".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in TextWorld. The goal is to follow a series of directions: go west, then south, open the passageway, go south again, travel west, venture north, retrieve the poem from the bedchamber, and then stop.

So far, the user has gone west from the studio to the attic, then south to the basement. They opened the passageway in the basement. Now, the next step according to the original instructions was to go south again from the basement. But after opening the passageway, the user is still in the basement. The current room is the basement, and there's a closed passageway south, an open door north, and an exit west.

Wait, the user's last action was "open passageway", which probably opened the south passageway. Now, the next step should be to go south through that passageway. But the user might be stuck if they keep repeating actions. Let me check the previous steps again.

Original steps: After opening the passageway, the next instruction was to go south. So the next action should be "go south". But the user might have already done that. Wait, no, the user's last action was opening the passageway, so the next step is to go south into the passageway. The current room is the basement, and the passageway is south. So "go south" is the correct next step. But the user might be in a loop if they keep going back. However, according to the instructions, after opening the passageway, they need to go south again. So the next action should be "go south".

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a TextWorld game and needs to follow specific steps to complete the objective. The goal mentioned earlier was to go west, then south, open a passageway, go south again, travel west, venture north, retrieve the poem from the bedchamber, and then stop.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Sauna. The previous actions were: go west (from Studio to Attic), go south (Attic to Basement), open passageway (Basement), go south (to Sauna). Now, the next step according to the original plan was to travel west again. But in the Sauna, the exits are north, east, west. The user is told to go west from the Sauna. However, the user might be stuck in a loop if they keep going back and forth. But in the Sauna, going west is possible. The sponge is on the floor, but that's not part of the main objective yet. The next step is to go west from the Sauna. But the user has to check if that's the correct next step. Since the original plan was to go west, then south, etc., but the current location is Sauna, the next step would be to go west. However, the user might have already done that. Wait, the previous action was go south to Sauna. So from Sauna, the next step is to go west. But the user needs to check if that's the correct direction. The user's next action should be to go west. But the user might be in a loop if they keep moving between rooms without progress. However, according to the steps, after Sauna, the next step is to go west. So the correct command is go west.

You are in a spare room. A typical one.

You can make out an opened ordinary looking cabinet in the corner. The cabinet is empty, what a horrible day!

Okay, let's break this down. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in TextWorld, following a specific sequence of actions. The goal is to eventually retrieve the poem from the bedchamber and then stop.

First, I need to recall the previous steps. The user started in the studio, went west to the attic, then south to the basement, opened a passageway, went south again to the sauna, then west to the spare room. Now, in the spare room, the next step according to the initial instructions was to go north, but the user hasn't done that yet.

Looking at the current room (Spare Room), the available exits are east, north, and the cabinet. The user's next action should be to go north, as per the original plan. However, the user might be stuck in a loop if they keep moving between rooms without making progress towards the poem. But since the last action was going west, the next logical step is to go north to continue the path towards the bedchamber.

Wait, the original plan after opening the passageway was to go south again, which led to the sauna. Then west to the spare room. Now, from the spare room, the next step should be north to continue the journey. The user hasn't yet reached the bedchamber, so going north is the next step. The cabinet is empty, so interacting with it might not be useful. The exit to the north is unblocked, so that's the way to go. No loops here because each step is moving towards the next room. So the next command should be "go north".

Okay, let's see. The user's goal is to retrieve the poem from the floor of the bedchamber. So far, they've navigated through several rooms: studio, attic, basement, sauna, spare room, and now the bedchamber. The last step mentioned was going north to reach the bedchamber, and now they're here.

In the bedchamber, there's a poem on the floor. The next logical step is to pick it up. The user's previous actions have been moving between rooms, and now they're in the correct location. The poem is already in the bedchamber, so the next command should be to take the poem. I need to make sure that the command is correct and follows the game's rules. Since the poem is on the floor, using "take poem" should be the right action here. No loops detected, so no need to change the action. Just retrieve the poem.
