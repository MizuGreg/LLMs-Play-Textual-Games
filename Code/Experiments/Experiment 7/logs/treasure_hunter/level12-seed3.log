Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to make an effort to go south. With that done, head west. And then, lift the worm from the floor of the kitchenette. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Bar =-
You've entered a bar. You can barely contain your excitement.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

-= Laundromat =-
You are in a laundromat.



There is an unguarded exit to the north. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Kitchenette =-
A well framed board tells you that you are now in the kitchenette.

You smell a sickening smell, and follow it to a saucepan. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

There is a worm on the floor.
