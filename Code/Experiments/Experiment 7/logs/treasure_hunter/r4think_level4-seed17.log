Of every kitchen you could have sauntered into, you had to walk into an ordinary one.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user wants me to figure out the next step in this text adventure game. The goal is to recover the fondue from the pantry's floor. Let me recap what's happened so far.

Starting in the Kitchen, I went north to the Pantry. Then I tried going east, which took me to the Bar, then west back to the Pantry. Then north again to the Office. Now, the Office has an exit to the south. Wait, but the fondue is still in the Pantry. So I must have looped between Pantry, Bar, and Office. The problem is that the Pantry's exits are east, north, south, but when I went east, I went to the Bar, then west back to Pantry. Then north to Office, then south back to Pantry. So I'm stuck in a loop between Pantry and Office.

The user's instruction says to break the loop by using a different action if needed. So maybe instead of going north from the Pantry again, which leads to Office, I need to find another way. Wait, the Pantry's exits are east, north, south. But when I went east, I went to the Bar, then west back. So maybe the correct path is to go east from Pantry to Bar, then east again from Bar to exit? Wait, the Bar has an exit to east and west. The Bar's description says there's an exit to the east (unguarded) and west. So from Bar, going east would take me out of the game? Or maybe to another area. But the user's goal is to get the fondue from the Pantry. So maybe I need to get back to the Pantry and then take the fondue.

Wait, the fondue is on the floor of the Pantry. So once I'm in the Pantry, I need to pick it up. But the problem is getting back to the Pantry. The current location is the Office, which has a south exit back to Pantry. So from Office, go south to Pantry. Then, once in Pantry, check if the fondue is there. Then pick it up. But the user's last action was going north from Pantry to Office. Now, in the Office, the exit is south to Pantry. So the next step is to go south from Office back to Pantry. Then, once in Pantry, take the fondue. But the user's previous steps were going back and forth. So the loop is between Pantry, Bar, Office. But the correct path is to go from Office south to Pantry, then take the fondue. So the next action should be go south from Office to Pantry, then take the fondue. But the user's last action was going north from Pantry to Office. Now, in Office, the exit is south. So the next step is to go south to Pantry. Then, in Pantry, take the fondue. So the answer should be go south.
</think>go south
