Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First off, go north. With that accomplished, make an effort to travel north. If you can get through with that, attempt to take a trip west. Okay, and then, attempt to travel south. And then, try to venture south. Then, try to move west. With that done, try to go to the west. With that done, attempt to go west. And then, pick-up the key from the floor of the canteen. Alright, thanks!

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a TextWorld game and needs to follow specific steps to reach the goal. The initial instructions were to go north, then north again, then west, south, west, and finally pick up the key from the canteen.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Studio again after going south from the Bedchamber. The previous steps were: go north (from Cookery to Garage), then north again (to Studio), then north again (to Bedchamber), then south back to Studio. So the user is looping between Studio and Bedchamber.

The goal is to pick up the key from the canteen. The user hasn't found the canteen yet. The current location is the Studio. The Studio has exits to north, south, and west. The Bedchamber is to the south, but that's where they came from. The west exit is unblocked. Maybe the canteen is in the west direction?

Wait, the initial instructions mentioned the canteen's floor where the key is. The user needs to go west from the Studio. Let me check the previous steps. The user was told to go west after some steps, but maybe they haven't done that yet. The current location is Studio, so going west from there might lead to the canteen. The key is on the floor of the canteen, so once they reach the canteen, they can pick it up.

But the user is in the Studio again. The previous action was going south from Bedchamber to Studio. Now, the next step should be to go west from Studio to reach the canteen. Then, once there, pick up the key. But the user hasn't tried that yet. So the next action should be to go west from the Studio.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to pick up the key from the canteen. So far, they've navigated through several rooms: Cookery, Garage, Studio, Bedchamber, Basement, Laundry Place, Attic, Launderette, and Sauna. They're currently in the Sauna, and the next step is to find the canteen.

Looking at the previous moves, the user kept going south and west, but got stuck in a loop between the Attic and Launderette. Now, in the Sauna, the only exit mentioned is north. But the canteen hasn't been found yet. The key is in the canteen, so the user needs to locate it.

Wait, the initial instructions mentioned the canteen's floor where the key is. Maybe the canteen is in a different direction. The user is in the Sauna, and the exit is north. But the canteen might be in the Laundry Place or another area. Alternatively, maybe the key is in the basement or another room. But the user hasn't checked all areas yet.

The user needs to find the canteen. Since the Sauna's exit is north, maybe going north from here would lead to the canteen. But the previous attempts to go south from the Attic didn't work. Maybe the canteen is in the Laundry Place or the Basement. The user needs to check all possible exits.

Alternatively, maybe the key is in the Sauna itself, but the description says the drawer is empty. So probably not. The user needs to find the canteen. The next step is to go north from the Sauna, even though it's a loop, but maybe that's the way to the canteen. Let's try that.

Okay, let's see. The user's goal is to pick up the key from the canteen. So far, they've been moving between the Launderette, Washroom, and other rooms, but haven't found the canteen yet. The key is in the canteen, so they need to locate it.

Looking at the current position, they're in the Launderette again after moving east and west. The previous attempts to go west and east just loop back. The user needs to find a different path. Maybe the canteen is in a different direction, like north or south. But the exits here are west, east, north, and south. Wait, in the Launderette, there's an unguarded exit to the east and south. Maybe going north from the Washroom? But the user was stuck in a loop between Launderette and Washroom. 

The user needs to break the loop. Since going east and west just brings them back, maybe trying north or south from the Washroom. The Washroom has an exit to the north and west. But the user was in the Washroom and went east to the Launderette. Maybe the canteen is in the north direction from the Washroom. But the user hasn't checked that yet. Alternatively, maybe the canteen is in the basement or another area. But the user hasn't explored those yet. 

Wait, the initial instructions mentioned the canteen's floor where the key is. The user needs to find the canteen. Since they're in the Launderette, maybe the canteen is in the south exit.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's try to figure out the next step. The user's goal is to pick up the key from the canteen. So far, they've been moving between several rooms like the Basement, Laundry Place, Cubicle, Cookhouse, and back again. They haven't found the canteen yet.

Looking at the current position, they're in the Laundry Place. The exits here are east, north, and west. The user has been going back and forth between these areas, which suggests they might be in a loop. The key is in the canteen, which hasn't been located yet. Maybe the canteen is in a different part of the map that's not been explored yet.

The previous actions have been going east, west, north, and south repeatedly. To break the loop, the user needs to try a different direction or look for clues. In the Laundry Place, there's an unblocked exit to the east. Maybe going east from here leads to the canteen. Alternatively, checking the north or west exits might reveal something new. But since the user has been stuck in a loop, trying a new direction is necessary. Let's try going east from the Laundry Place.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Garage and Cookery. They've been going back and forth between these two rooms repeatedly. The goal is to pick up the key from the canteen, but so far, the user hasn't found the canteen yet.

Looking at the current position, they're in the Cookery again. The exits here are south (which leads back to the Garage) and west. The user has been trying to go north from the Cookery, but that leads back to the Garage. The key is in the canteen, which hasn't been located. Maybe the canteen is in a different part of the map that's not been explored yet.

The user needs to break the loop. Since they've been going south and north between the Garage and Cookery, maybe they need to try a different direction. The Cookery has an unblocked exit to the west. Perhaps going west from the Cookery leads to the canteen. Let's try that.

You are in a washroom. An usual kind of place.

You see a safe. The safe is empty! What a waste of a day! You can see a dresser.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Look over there! a mantelpiece. The mantelpiece appears to be empty. You can make out a bookshelf. The bookshelf is ordinary. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the bookshelf! oh well. You see a recliner. The recliner is normal. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

Guess what, you are in a place we're calling a cubicle. Let's see what's in here.

As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a cabinet. You see a stand! The stand is typical. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

You arrive in a typical kind of place. That is to say, you're in a chamber. Let's see what's in here.

Look over there! a mantelpiece. The mantelpiece appears to be empty. You can make out a bookshelf. The bookshelf is ordinary. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the bookshelf! oh well. You see a recliner. The recliner is normal. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.
