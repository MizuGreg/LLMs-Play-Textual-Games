Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First stop, make an effort to go west. And then, lift the carrot from the floor of the chamber. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Bedchamber =-
Well, here we are in the bedchamber.



There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

go west

-= Chamber =-
Okay, so you're in a chamber, cool, but is it usual? You better believe it is. You begin looking for stuff.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a carrot on the floor.

That's not a verb I recognise.
