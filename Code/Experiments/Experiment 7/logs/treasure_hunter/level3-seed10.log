Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First stop, make an effort to go west. And then, lift the carrot from the floor of the chamber. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Bedchamber =-
Well, here we are in the bedchamber.



There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

-= Chamber =-
Okay, so you're in a chamber, cool, but is it usual? You better believe it is. You begin looking for stuff.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a carrot on the floor.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a TextWorld game. Their task is to first go west, then pick up the carrot in the chamber.

Looking at the current environment, they're in the Chamber. The previous action was "go west", which led them here. Now, the Chamber has a carrot on the floor. The next step is to pick up the carrot. The exits are east and north, but the main goal is to collect the carrot. Since the user has already moved west, the next logical step is to pick up the carrot. There's no mention of a loop here, so no need to change actions. Just pick up the carrot.

That's not a verb I recognise.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to play TextWorld and has encountered an issue where the command "lift the carrot" wasn't recognized. The goal is to first go west, then lift the carrot. The user has already gone west, ending up in the Chamber where there's a carrot on the floor.

First, I need to recall the game's objective: the player must go west, then pick up the carrot. The user's previous action was "go west", which worked. Now, in the Chamber, they need to pick up the carrot. The problem is that "lift the carrot" isn't a valid command. So, what's the correct verb here? In TextWorld, common verbs for picking up items are "take" or "get". So maybe the correct command is "take the carrot" or "get the carrot".

Looking back at the game's possible commands, the player might need to use "take" instead of "lift". The user tried "lift", which wasn't recognized, so the next step is to use "take". That makes sense because "take" is a standard verb for picking up items in such games. So the next action should be "take the carrot". Let me check if there's any other possible command, but I think "take" is the right choice here. The user needs to use that to pick up the carrot successfully.
