I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, head east. Then, make an effort to travel south. After that, attempt to go west. And then, retrieve the carrot from the floor of the chamber. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Spare Room =-
You find yourself in a spare room. A typical one.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

-= Attic =-
You have entered an attic. Not the attic you'd expect. No, this is an attic. The room is well lit.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

There is a latchkey on the floor.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text-based game where they need to navigate through rooms and find a carrot. The initial steps mentioned are to go east, then south, west, and finally retrieve the carrot.

First, the user started in the Spare Room, went east to the Attic. Now, in the Attic, the prompt says to try going north, south, or west. The user needs to proceed according to the task: after going east, they should go south. But in the Attic, going south might not be possible directly. The current room is the Attic, and the next step according to the task is to go south from the Spare Room, but they're now in the Attic. Wait, maybe the initial directions were to go east (from Spare Room to Attic), then south from there. But the Attic's description says to try going north, south, or west. The user might be stuck in a loop between the Spare Room and Attic.

The user's past actions: went east (from Spare Room to Attic). The next step according to the task is to go south. But in the Attic, going south might not be possible. The Attic's description mentions a latchkey on the floor. Maybe the user needs to pick up the latchkey first? Or perhaps the correct path is to go west from the Attic back to the Spare Room, then south from there. But the task says after going east, go south. So maybe the user is in the Attic and needs to go west back to Spare Room, then south. But the initial instruction was to go east, then south. So maybe the user is in the Attic and needs to go south from there. However, the Attic's description says to try going north, south, or west. Let me check the game's possible paths again.

In the Attic, the user is told to try going north, south, or west. The task says after going east (to Attic), go south. So from the Attic, going south would be the next step. But the Attic's description might not have a south exit. Wait, the initial task says after going east, make an effort to travel south. So maybe the user is in the Attic and needs to go south. But the Attic's description says to try going south. So the user should try going south from the Attic. However, the current room is the Attic, and the next step is to go south. But the user might be in a loop between the Attic and Spare Room. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west from the Attic back to the Spare Room, then south from there. But the task says after going east, go south. So perhaps the user is in the Attic and needs to go south. But if that's not possible, maybe the user needs to find another way. The Attic has a latchkey on the floor. Maybe picking up the latchkey is necessary to proceed. But the task is to retrieve the carrot, not sure if the latchkey is related. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west from the Attic to the Spare Room, then south. But the task says after going east, go south. So maybe the user is in the Attic and needs to go south. However, the Attic's description doesn't mention a south exit. Wait, the initial task says after going east, make an effort to travel south. So the user is in the Attic and needs to go south. But the Attic's description says to try going south. So the user should try going south from the Attic. But if that's not possible, maybe the user is in a loop. The user needs to break the loop by trying a different action, like using a synonym for west instead of south. But the task says to go south after east. So perhaps the correct next step is to go south from the Attic. But the user might be stuck. Alternatively, the user should go west from the Attic back to the Spare Room, then south. But the task says after east, go south. So maybe the user is in the Attic and needs to go south. However, the Attic's description might not have a south exit. The user needs to check the possible directions again. The Attic's description says to try going north, south, or west. So the user can try going south. If that's not possible, then maybe the user needs to go west. But the task says to go south after east. So the user should try going south. If that's not possible, then maybe the user is in a loop and needs to try a different action. The user's next action should be to go south from the Attic.

Well, here we are in the bedchamber.



There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in TextWorld. The goal is to go east, then south, then west, and finally retrieve the carrot.

First, they started in the Spare Room, went east to the Attic. Then they went south to the Bedchamber. Now, they're in the Bedchamber. The next step according to the initial plan was to go west. But the user's last action was "go south", which might have been a mistake. Wait, no. Let me check the history again.

Wait, the user's first action was "go east" from the Spare Room. Then, in the Attic, they were told to go south, so they did "go south" again. Then they ended up in the Bedchamber. Now, the next step according to the original plan was to go west. But in the Bedchamber, the exits are north and west. So the next step should be to go west. But the user's last action was "go south", which might have been a mistake. Wait, no. Let me retrace.

Original task: Head east, then south, then west. So first, go east (done). Then go south (done). Then go west (next step). But in the Bedchamber, the user is told there's an exit to the north and west. So the next step is to go west. But the user's last action was "go south" which was part of the initial steps. Wait, maybe the user is confused. Let me check the current room.

In the Bedchamber, the user is told there's an unblocked exit to the north and west. So the next step is to go west. But the user's last action was "go south" which was part of the initial steps. Wait, maybe the user is in the Bedchamber now, and the next step is to go west. So the next action should be "go west". But the user's previous action was "go south" which was part of the initial steps. Wait, maybe the user is following the steps correctly. Let me make sure.

Original steps: 1. Go east (done). 2. Go south (done). 3. Go west (next). So in the Bedchamber, the user needs to go west. So the next action is "go west". But the user's last action was "go south", which was part of the initial steps. So the next step is to go west. Therefore, the correct next action is "go west".

-= Chamber =-
Okay, so you're in a chamber, cool, but is it usual? You better believe it is. You begin looking for stuff.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a carrot on the floor.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing a text adventure game where they need to navigate through different rooms and eventually retrieve a carrot to win. Let me break down the current situation.

First, the goal is to go east, then south, then west, and finally get the carrot. So far, the user has gone east from the spare room to the attic, then south to the bedchamber, then west to the chamber. Now they're in the chamber, which has an exit to the east and north, and there's a carrot on the floor.

The next step according to the original plan is to retrieve the carrot. But the user hasn't done that yet. The current room (chamber) has the carrot on the floor, so the next action should be to pick it up. However, in text adventures, sometimes you need to use specific commands like 'take carrot' or 'get carrot'. But the user's previous actions were all 'go' commands. Wait, the instructions said to retrieve the carrot from the floor of the chamber. So the correct action here is to pick up the carrot. But the system message says to output only the command, nothing else. So the answer should be 'take carrot' or 'get carrot'. But looking at the previous interactions, the user used 'go' commands. However, in the current room, the carrot is on the floor, so the correct action is to pick it up. Therefore, the next command should be 'take carrot'.
