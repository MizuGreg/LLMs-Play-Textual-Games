Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First stop, go to the north. And then, move west. If you can succeed at that, head south. Then, head south. Then, move east. After that, doublecheck that the wooden passageway inside the cubicle is ajar. Then, head east. Then, make an attempt to travel east. Following that, lift the keycard from the floor of the workshop. And once you've done that, you win!

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text-based game where they need to follow a series of directions to win. The initial steps were to go north and then west, but they ended up in a shower. Now, they need to figure out the next moves.

First, the goal is to follow the exact sequence: go north, west, south, south, east, check the wooden passageway, east again, then lift the keycard. But the user is in the shower now. The previous action was going north, which led them to the shower. Then they tried moving west, which might have been the correct step. But the current location is the shower, and the available exits are south and west. 

Wait, the user's last action was "go north" which took them to the shower. Then the next instruction was to move west. But in the shower, the user can go south or west. So moving west from the shower would take them back to the studio? Or maybe another area. But the user needs to proceed through the steps as given. 

The next step in the original instructions after moving west is to head south twice. But in the shower, moving south would take them back to the studio. Then maybe they can proceed further. However, the user is at the shower now, and the next step according to the original plan is to go south. But the user might be stuck in a loop if they keep moving between the studio and shower. 

So the user needs to check if they're in a loop. If moving west from the shower leads back to the studio, then maybe they need to find another way. Alternatively, maybe the correct path is to go south from the shower to the studio again, then proceed with the next steps. But the user has to follow the exact sequence. 

The next step after moving west in the shower would be to go south, then south again. But the user might be repeating steps. So the key is to ensure that each action is followed correctly without looping. The user needs to move south from the shower to return to the studio, then proceed with the next steps as instructed. 

Therefore, the next action should be to go south from the shower to return to the studio, then continue with the subsequent steps.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through a text-based game. The goal is to follow a series of directions to reach the wooden passageway, lift the keycard, and win. 

First, the initial steps were to go north, then west, south, south, east, check the passageway, east again, then lift the keycard. But the user is getting stuck in a loop between the studio and the shower.

Looking at the current state: after going south from the shower, they're back in the studio. The previous actions were go north, then south, which brought them back. So they're in a loop between the two rooms. The problem is that the same actions are leading them back, so they need to find a different approach.

The next step should be to avoid the loop. Instead of going south again, maybe they should try west first. The studio has an exit to the west, which is unblocked. So perhaps going west from the studio would be the way to go instead of south. That way, they can progress further without looping.

So the next action should be to go west. That's a different command from the previous ones, breaking the loop and moving towards the next part of the game.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in a text-based game. The goal is to follow a specific sequence of movements and actions to win. Let me break down the current situation.

First, the user started by going north, then south, then west. Now they're in the Spare Room. The next steps according to the initial instructions were to go south again, then east, check the wooden passageway, then east again, lift the keycard, and win. But the user has already gone west from the Studio, leading them to the Spare Room.

Looking at the current room (Spare Room), there's an exit to the east, north, and south. The user needs to proceed according to the original plan. The next step in the original plan after going west was to head south, then east, etc. But the user might be stuck in a loop if they keep moving between rooms without progress.

Wait, the original instructions said after going west, the next step was to head east. But in the Spare Room, the user can go east, north, or south. The user's previous action was going west, so the next step should be to go east as per the original plan. However, the user might have already done that. Let me check the steps again.

Original steps: Go north, move west, head south, head south, move east, check the wooden passageway, head east, lift the keycard. So after the initial movements, the user is in the Spare Room. The next step after going west (from Studio) is to go south, then east. But in the Spare Room, the user can go south, which would take them back to the Studio. Then from Studio, go east to the next room. But the user might be going in circles here.

Wait, the user's last action was going west to the Spare Room. The next step in the original plan was to head south (from the Studio), but the user is now in the Spare Room. So maybe the user needs to go east from the Spare Room to proceed. Alternatively, check if the wooden passageway is ajar. But the user hasn't reached that yet.

The user's current position is the Spare Room. The next step according to the original plan is to head south (from Studio), but since they are in the Spare Room, maybe they need to go east to the next room. However, the original plan says after moving west, head south, then south again, then east. So perhaps the user needs to go south from the Spare Room to return to the Studio, then east to the next room. But the user might be repeating actions. The key is to avoid loops by using different directions if necessary.

In the Spare Room, the user can go east, which might lead them to the next room. So the next action should be to go east. But the user has to follow the exact steps. Let me make sure the steps are correct. The original plan says after moving west, head south, then south again, then east. So from the Spare Room, going south would take them back to the Studio, then from Studio, go east. But the user might have already done that. Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go east from the Spare Room directly. However, the original plan says after moving west, head south, then south again. So perhaps the user needs to go south from the Spare Room to the Studio, then south again (but the Studio has an exit to the south, which is the Shower again). That might be a loop.

Wait, the initial steps were: go north, move west, head south, head south, move east. So after moving west (to Spare Room), the next step is to head south (to Studio), then south again (to Shower), then east (to somewhere else). But the user is in the Spare Room now. So the next step is to go south to the Studio. Then from Studio, go south again to the Shower. Then from Shower, go east. But the user needs to check the wooden passageway inside the cubicle. Maybe that's in a different room.

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go east from the Spare Room. But the original plan says after moving west, head south, then south again. So the user needs to go south from Spare Room to Studio, then south again to Shower, then east. But the user might be stuck in a loop between Studio and Shower. The key is to proceed as per the original steps, even if it means revisiting rooms.

So the next action should be to go south from the Spare Room to return to the Studio. Then from Studio, go south again to the Shower. Then from Shower, go east. Then check the wooden passageway. Then go east again, then lift the keycard. But the user is currently in the Spare Room, so the next step is to go south.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in a text-based game. The goal is to follow a specific sequence of movements and actions to reach the end.

First, the initial steps mentioned in the user's message are: go north, then west, south, south, east, check the wooden passageway, east again, lift the keycard, and then win. But the user is getting stuck in a loop between the Studio and Shower rooms.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Bedchamber. The exits here are east and north. The previous actions were going south from the Spare Room, which led to the Bedchamber. Now, the next step according to the original plan was to go south again, but that might not be the right path.

Wait, the user's goal is to eventually reach the workshop to lift the keycard. The current path seems to be going in circles between the Studio, Shower, Spare Room, and Bedchamber. The key is to find the correct path that leads towards the workshop.

In the Studio, the user was told to go north first. But after going north, they ended up in the Shower, then south back to Studio, then west to Spare Room, south to Bedchamber. Maybe the correct path is to go east from the Bedchamber instead of north. The Bedchamber has an exit to the east which is unblocked. Maybe that's the way to go towards the workshop.

So the next step should be to go east from the Bedchamber. That would be the next logical move towards the workshop, avoiding the loop. The user needs to break the loop by choosing a different direction when possible.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in a text-based game. The goal is to follow a specific sequence of movements and eventually lift the keycard to win.

First, I need to recall the original instructions. The user was told to go north, then west, south, south, east, check the wooden passageway, east again, then lift the keycard. But the current position is the Cubicle, where there's a closed wooden passageway east. The next step according to the original plan was to check if the passageway is ajar. However, the user hasn't done that yet.

Looking at the current room (Cubicle), the exits are north, west, and east (but the passageway is closed). The previous actions were: go north (from Studio to Shower), then south (back to Studio), then west (to Spare Room), then south (to Bedchamber), then east (to Cubicle). So the next step should be to check the wooden passageway. But the instruction says to "doublecheck that the wooden passageway inside the cubicle is ajar." So maybe the user needs to open it or check if it's open.

But in the game's current state, the passageway is closed. So the user needs to find a way to open it. However, the user hasn't picked up the keycard yet. The keycard is in the workshop, which hasn't been visited yet. Wait, the original plan was after moving east from the cubicle, then lift the keycard from the workshop. But the current location is the Cubicle. So maybe the next step is to check the passageway, then proceed east, then go to the workshop to lift the keycard.

But the user is at the Cubicle. The next step in the original plan was to "head east" from the cubicle. But the passageway is closed. So perhaps the user needs to open it first. However, the game might require interacting with the passageway. But the user hasn't done that yet. The instruction says to "doublecheck that the wooden passageway inside the cubicle is ajar." So maybe the user needs to check if it's open. If it's closed, they might need to find a way to open it, perhaps using the keycard. But the keycard is in the workshop. So maybe the user needs to go through the passageway, but it's closed. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to look for a key or another item.

Wait, the user is at the Cubicle. The passageway east is closed. The next step in the original plan was to "head east" after checking the passageway. But if it's closed, the user can't go through. So perhaps the user needs to find a way to open it. However, the keycard is in the workshop, which is not yet visited. So the user needs to go through the passageway, but it's closed. Maybe the user needs to check if the passageway is open, then proceed. But the user hasn't done that yet. The original plan says to check if it's ajar. So the next step is to check the passageway. But the game might require interacting with it, like opening it. However, the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action should be to check the passageway. But the user's previous action was going east to the Cubicle. Now, the next step is to check the passageway. But the game might not allow that unless the user interacts with it. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east through the passageway, but it's closed. So perhaps the user needs to find a way to open it, which might involve the keycard. But the keycard is in the workshop. So the user needs to go to the workshop, but how?

Wait, the original plan was after moving east from the cubicle, then lift the keycard from the workshop. But the user is at the Cubicle. So the next step is to go east through the passageway. But it's closed. So maybe the user needs to open it. But how? Maybe the keycard is needed to open it. But the keycard is in the workshop. So the user needs to go to the workshop, but that's not possible unless they can get through the passageway. This seems like a loop. The user is stuck at the Cubicle, unable to proceed east because the passageway is closed. So the next action should be to check the passageway, but the game might not allow that unless the user interacts with it. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to look for a key or another item. But the only item mentioned is a legume on the floor in the Studio, which isn't relevant.

Wait, the user's previous steps were: go north, south, west, south, east. Now at Cubicle. The next step in the original plan was to check the passageway. So the user needs to check if it's open. But the game says the passageway is closed. So the user needs to find a way to open it. But the keycard is in the workshop. So the user needs to go to the workshop, but how? The only way is through the passageway. So the user is stuck. Therefore, the user needs to find another way. Maybe the user needs to go north or west from the Cubicle. But the original plan says to go east. So perhaps the user needs to find a way to open the passageway. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to check the passageway first. The instruction says to "doublecheck that the wooden passageway inside the cubicle is ajar."

But the original plan says to go east. So perhaps the user needs to go east, but the passageway is closed. Therefore, the user is in a loop. The previous actions didn't make progress. So the user needs to try a different action, like using a synonym for "go east," but the game might not recognize it. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to look for a key or another item.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in a text-based game. The goal is to follow a specific sequence of movements and actions to win. Let me break down the current situation.

First, the user has already moved through several rooms: starting in the studio, then the shower, spare room, bedchamber, and now the cubicle. The next step in the original instructions was to check if the wooden passageway inside the cubicle is ajar. The user tried "check passageway" but found the lid in the way. 

So, the next logical step would be to try to open the passageway. Since the lid is blocking it, maybe the user needs to interact with it, like pushing or pulling. The original instruction mentioned lifting the keycard later, so perhaps the passageway is locked and requires a key. But the user hasn't picked up the keycard yet.

Wait, the user's next action after checking the passageway was to try to open it. Since the lid is in the way, maybe the correct action is to "push" or "pull" the lid. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the keycard to open it. But the keycard is in the workshop, which hasn't been reached yet.

Looking back at the steps: the user needs to go east from the cubicle, then check the passageway, then move east again, then lift the keycard. But in the current state, the user is in the cubicle, and the passageway is closed. So the next step is to open the passageway. The correct action here would be to "open the passageway" or "push the lid". Since the user tried "check passageway" and it didn't work, maybe the correct action is to "push" or "pull" the lid. However, the game might require a specific command like "open" or "push".

But the user's previous action was "check passageway", which didn't work. So the next step is to try to open it. The correct command would be "open passageway" or "push lid". Since the game might expect a specific verb, "open" is more likely. But the user needs to make sure they are using the right command. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "pull" the lid. However, the game might not accept synonyms, so the exact command is important.

In the previous steps, the user was told to "check the wooden passageway inside the cubicle is ajar". So the user needs to check if it's open. But since it's closed, the next step is to open it. The correct action here is "open passageway".

FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in a text-based game. The goal is to follow a series of directions to eventually lift the keycard and win.

First, I need to recall the steps mentioned in the initial instructions. The user was told to go north, then west, south, south, east, check the wooden passageway, then east again, lift the keycard, and win. 

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Cubicle room. They just opened the wooden passageway. The next step according to the original plan was to head east again. But after opening the passageway, the next action should be to move east into the passageway. However, the user might be stuck if they don't proceed correctly.

Wait, the current room is the Cubicle. The passageway is east. So after opening it, the next logical step is to go east into the passageway. But the user might have already done that. Let me check the history.

Previous actions: go north, go west, go south, go east, check passageway, open passageway. Now, the next step should be to move east into the passageway. But the user might need to check if that's the correct direction. Alternatively, maybe the keycard is in the workshop, so after moving east, they need to lift the keycard.

But the user's last action was opening the passageway. The next step is to go east into the passageway. Then, perhaps they can find the keycard there. However, the user might have to navigate through the passageway to reach the workshop. So the next command should be "go east" to enter the passageway. Then, after that, they can proceed to lift the keycard.

But the user might be in a loop if they keep going back and forth. However, the current room is the Cubicle, and the passageway is east. So the correct next step is to go east into the passageway. That should lead them to the next room where the keycard is located. Therefore, the next action is "go east".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in this TextWorld game. The goal is to follow a specific sequence of movements and actions to eventually lift the keycard and win.

First, I need to recap the game's objective step by step. The original instructions were: go north, then west, south, south, east, check the wooden passageway, east again, then lift the keycard. But the user has already gone through some of these steps.

Looking at the current state: the user is in the Laundromat room. The previous actions included going north, west, south, south, east, opening the passageway, and then going east again. Now, the next step according to the original plan was to lift the keycard from the workshop floor. But the current location is the Laundromat, so maybe the keycard is in the workshop, which is another room.

Wait, the user needs to find the workshop. The original plan mentions lifting the keycard from the workshop floor. So after going east from the Laundromat, maybe the workshop is next. But the Laundromat has an open wooden gateway leading east. So the next step would be to go east from here. But the user just did that, and the next room is the Laundromat. Wait, the user is in the Laundromat, and the passage west is open, and east is a gateway. So maybe the workshop is east of the Laundromat.

But the user's next action should be to go east from the Laundromat to reach the workshop. Then, once there, lift the keycard. So the next command should be "go east" again. But the user just did that, and the next room is the Laundromat. Wait, maybe the workshop is in the next room. Let me check the previous steps again.

The user was in the Cubicle, opened the passageway, then went east to the Laundromat. Now, the Laundromat has an open gateway east. So going east from here would lead to the workshop. Therefore, the next step is to go east again. But the user is already in the Laundromat, so "go east" is the next action. Then, once in the workshop, lift the keycard. So the next command is "go east".

There is an open stone gate leading east. There is an open wooden gateway leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked.

There is a keycard on the floor.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in a TextWorld game. The goal is to follow a specific sequence of movements and actions to eventually lift the keycard and win.

First, I need to recall the original instructions. The user was told to go north, then west, south, south, east, check the wooden passageway, then east again, and finally lift the keycard. But in the current state, the user is in the Workshop, which has a keycard on the floor. The next step according to the original plan was to lift the keycard after moving east and checking the passageway. 

Looking at the current room (Workshop), there's a keycard on the floor. The previous action was going east from the Laundromat to the Workshop. The next step should be to pick up the keycard. The user's last action was "go east" to reach the Workshop. Now, the keycard is here, so the next command should be to pick it up. The correct action here is "take keycard" or "lift keycard". Since the game mentions "lift the keycard", using "lift" might be more accurate. But in the previous steps, the user was told to "lift the keycard from the floor of the workshop". So the correct command here is "lift keycard".

I need to make sure that this is the next step. The user has already followed the path: north, west, south, south, east, checked the passageway, went east again to the Workshop. Now, the keycard is here, so lifting it should be the next action. There's no loop here because the keycard is in the current room. So the next command is "lift keycard".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to win the game by following a series of steps. The goal is to lift the keycard from the floor of the workshop and then win. Earlier, the user tried "lift keycard" but the system said that's not a recognized verb.

So, the next step is to figure out the correct action. Since "lift" isn't working, maybe the correct verb is "pick up" instead. In many text adventures, "pick up" is used for taking items. Let me check the previous steps again.

The user was in the Workshop, and there's a keycard on the floor. The correct action should be to pick up the keycard. The system rejected "lift," so "pick up" is likely the right command. That's the next step after opening the passageway and moving east to the Workshop. So the next action should be "pick up keycard."
