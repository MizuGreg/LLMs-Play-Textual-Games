Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an fast paced round of TextWorld? You do! Here is how to play! Your first objective is to take a trip east. After that, make an attempt to head south. And then, try to take a trip west. If you can do that, recover the latchkey from the floor of the studio. Alright, thanks!

-= Workshop =-
You arrive in a workshop. An ordinary one.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

-= Spare Room =-
You are in a spare room. A standard one. You begin looking for stuff.

You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a shelf. But there isn't a thing on it.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and retrieve a latchkey. The current room is the Spare Room, and they've already gone east from the Workshop. The goal is to go east, then south, then west, and find the latchkey.

First, I need to check the current position. The user is in the Spare Room. The exits here are east, north, south, and west. The next step after going east was to attempt to head south. But the user is now in the Spare Room, so maybe they need to go south from here. However, the initial instruction was to go east first, then south, then west. Wait, the first objective was to take a trip east, then attempt to head south, then west. So after going east to the Spare Room, the next step is to go south. But the user is already in the Spare Room. So maybe the next action is to go south from the Spare Room. Then, after that, go west. But the user needs to check if those exits are available. The Spare Room has an exit to the south, so going south should be possible. Then, after reaching the next room, they need to go west. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next step is to go south from the Spare Room. Then, once they're in the next room, they can try going west. But the user's current position is the Spare Room, so the next action is to go south. Then, after that, go west. But the user needs to make sure they're not looping. Since they've already gone east once, going south from here is the next step. So the next command should be "go south".
</think>go south

-= Steam Room =-
You find yourself in a steam room. A typical one.

You can make out a box, so there's that. You make out a rack. The rack is typical. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can see a table. The table is normal. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in a text-based game. The goal is to go east, then south, then west, and finally recover the latchkey from the studio floor.

First, I need to recap the game's objective step by step. The first step is to go east. The user already did that, moving from the Workshop to the Spare Room. Then, the next step is to go south. The user then moved from the Spare Room to the Steam Room. Now, the third step is to go west. But in the current Steam Room description, the exits mentioned are east, north, and west. So the next logical step would be to go west. However, the user might be in a loop if they keep moving between rooms without making progress. But since the Steam Room has a west exit, and the goal is to go west after south, the next action should be west. But wait, the user's previous action was going south, so the next step is to go west. However, the Steam Room's exits are east, north, west. So going west from here would be the next step. But the user needs to check if that's the correct direction. Alternatively, maybe the user is in a loop between rooms, but since each room has different exits, moving west from the Steam Room is the next step towards the goal. So the next command should be "go west".
</think>go west

-= Studio =-
You've just shown up in a studio. You can barely contain your excitement.

Oh, great. Here's a stand. The stand appears to be empty.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

There is a latchkey on the floor.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text adventure game. The goal is to take a trip east, then south, then west, and finally recover the latchkey from the studio floor.

Looking at the history, the user first went east from the workshop to the spare room. Then they went south to the steam room, then west to the studio. Now they're in the studio, and there's a latchkey on the floor. The next step should be to pick up the latchkey. But the previous action was going west, which led them to the studio. Now they need to pick up the latchkey. The correct command here would be to take the latchkey. But the user might have already done that. Wait, the current room is the studio, and the latchkey is on the floor. So the next action is to pick it up. The answer should be "take latchkey".
</think>take latchkey
