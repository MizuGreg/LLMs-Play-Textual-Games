Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First, it would be great if you could make an attempt to travel west. With that over with, take a trip north. That done, try to move north. And then, pick-up the knife from the floor of the cookhouse. Alright, thanks!

-= Pantry =-
You are in a pantry. A typical kind of place.



There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

There is a sock on the floor.

-= Parlor =-
Guess what, you are in a place we're calling a parlor. The room is well lit.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text-based game where they need to follow specific steps to reach the goal. The initial instructions were to go west, then north, then north again, and finally pick up the knife in the cookhouse.

First, I need to recall the current environment. The user started in the pantry, went west to the parlor. Now, in the parlor, the possible exits are east, north, and possibly others. The next step according to the initial instructions was to go north again. But the user might be stuck in a loop if moving north doesn't lead them closer to the cookhouse.

Looking at the current location: the parlor. The user needs to move north to proceed. However, if moving north from the parlor leads back to the pantry or another room that's already been visited, that's a loop. The goal is to reach the cookhouse and pick up the knife. So, after the parlor, moving north might take them to the cookhouse. But the user has to check if that's the case.

Wait, the initial steps were: go west (from pantry to parlor), then north (from parlor to cookhouse?), then north again? Or maybe the cookhouse is north of the parlor. If the user is in the parlor and moves north, they might reach the cookhouse. Then, once there, they can pick up the knife. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next step after the parlor is to go north to the cookhouse. Then, pick up the knife. But the user's last action was going west, then the system responded with the parlor description. Now, the user needs to go north from the parlor to reach the cookhouse. So the next action should be "go north" again. But the user might have already done that. Wait, the original instructions said: "travel west. With that over with, take a trip north. That done, try to move north. And then, pick-up the knife..." So after west, go north once, then again north? Or maybe the cookhouse is north of the parlor. So from the parlor, going north would take them to the cookhouse. Then, once there, pick up the knife. So the next step is to go north from the parlor. But the user is currently in the parlor, so the next action is "go north".

-= Shower =-
This might come as a shock to you, but you've just moved into a shower. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Shower room now. The previous steps were: first, they went west from the Pantry to the Parlor, then went north to the Shower. The goal was to travel west, then north, then pick up the knife from the cookhouse.

Wait, but the current room is the Shower. The user needs to pick up the knife from the cookhouse. But where is the cookhouse? The previous rooms were Pantry, Parlor, Shower. Maybe the cookhouse is another room. The user has to find the cookhouse and get the knife.

But in the current Shower room, the exits are east, north, south. The user needs to move towards the cookhouse. Maybe the cookhouse is north of the Shower? But the user has to check. However, the user hasn't found the cookhouse yet. So the next step is to move north from the Shower to reach the cookhouse. Then pick up the knife.

Wait, but the user's previous actions were: go west (from Pantry to Parlor), then go north (from Parlor to Shower). Now, in the Shower, the next step is to go north again? But the user needs to reach the cookhouse. Maybe the cookhouse is north of the Shower. So the next action is to go north again. But the user has to check if that's possible. The Shower's north exit is unguarded, so they can go there. Then, once in the next room, look for the knife.

Alternatively, maybe the cookhouse is in a different direction. But based on the previous steps, the user needs to move north from the Shower. So the next command should be 'go north' again. But the user has to make sure they're not looping. However, the user hasn't reached the cookhouse yet, so moving north is necessary. Therefore, the next action is 'go north'.

-= Cookhouse =-
You've entered a cookhouse. You begin looking for stuff.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

There is a knife on the floor.

Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is in a text-based game where they need to follow specific steps to reach the goal. The initial instructions said to travel west, then north, then north again, and finally pick up the knife from the cookhouse.

Looking at the current scene, the user is in the Cookhouse. The previous steps were: starting in the Pantry, going west to the Parlor, then north to the Shower, then north again to the Cookhouse. Now, the Cookhouse is the next step. The goal was to pick up the knife from the floor here. 

The user's last action was "go north" which led them to the Cookhouse. Now, the next step is to pick up the knife. The available commands include "take" which is used to pick up objects. The knife is on the floor, so the correct command would be "take knife". 

I need to make sure that the next action is indeed taking the knife. The previous steps were moving around, and now the objective is to collect the knife. So the next command should be "take knife".
