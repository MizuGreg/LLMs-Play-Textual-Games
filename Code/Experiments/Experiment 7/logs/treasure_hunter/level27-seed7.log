Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First stop, head west. That done, try to head south. Following that, venture south. Then, go east. And then, go north. Then, make an attempt to go to the east. If you can do that, take a trip east. Following that, make an attempt to head north. And then, take a trip east. And then, move south. After that, move south. That done, travel west. After that, go west. With that accomplished, take the keycard from the saucepan within the scullery. And if you do that, you're the winner!

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let me try to figure out how to win this game. The user's goal is to collect the keycard from the saucepan in the scullery. Let me recap the steps they've taken so far.

First, they started by going west from the washroom. Then they went south to the parlor, then south again to the lounge, east to the kitchen, north to the cookery, east to the dish-pit, north to the vault, east to the cubicle, south to the bathroom, west to the scullery. Now they're in the scullery, and the keycard is on the saucepan. The next step is to pick up the keycard. But the prompt says to take the keycard from the saucepan within the scullery. So the action here would be to take the keycard. But the previous steps might have already done that. Wait, the user's last action was going west to the scullery, and now they're in the scullery. The description says the saucepan is there with the keycard. So the next step is to take the keycard. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the correct action here is to take the keycard. But the game might require using the correct command. The possible actions here are to take the keycard from the saucepan. So the next command should be "take keycard from saucepan" or something similar. But the game's previous responses have used commands like "go west" or "go south". So maybe the correct command here is "take keycard from saucepan". But I need to check if that's the right syntax. Alternatively, maybe just "take keycard" if it's in the inventory. But according to the description, the keycard is on the saucepan, so the correct action is to take it from there. Therefore, the next step is to take the keycard from the saucepan in the scullery. That should complete the objective and win the game.
