Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, make sure that the portal inside the cellar is open. After that, make an effort to move south. Then, move west. Then, make an attempt to go to the north. Once you succeed at that, head west. And then, pick-up the peanut from the floor of the studio. Got that? Good!

-= Cellar =-
I am pleased to announce that you are now in the cellar.



There is a closed portal leading south. There is an open hatch leading north.

Guess what, you are in the place we're calling the cubicle. You begin looking for stuff.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to open the portal in the cellar, then move south, west, north, west again, and finally pick up the peanut in the studio. So far, the user has opened the portal in the cellar and moved south to the kitchenette, then west to the cubicle, north to the steam room. Now, they need to go west from the steam room. But the current location is the steam room, which has a west door. So the next step is to go west from there. But wait, the user just tried to go north from the cubicle, which led to the steam room. Now, in the steam room, the available directions are south and west. The next step after the steam room would be to go west. But the user might be stuck in a loop if they keep moving between rooms without progress. However, the user hasn't picked up the peanut yet, so the next logical step is to go west from the steam room. Let me check the previous steps again. The user needs to go west from the steam room, then maybe proceed to the next area where the peanut is. So the next action should be 'go west' again.
</think>go west

-= Studio =-
You arrive in a studio. A standard one.



There is an open door leading east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked.

There is a peanut on the floor.
