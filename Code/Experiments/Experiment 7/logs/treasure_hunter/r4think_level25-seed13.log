Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an exciting round of TextWorld? You do! Here is how to play! First step, attempt to go east. And then, move north. Once you accomplish that, try to head west. That done, head west. Okay, and then, make an attempt to go to the west. Once you finish that, travel west. If you can get through with that, make an attempt to go south. If you can finish that, try to go east. After that, make an attempt to venture south. And then, travel south. Then, retrieve the keycard from the floor of the bar. Alright, thanks!

-= Salon =-
You find yourself in a salon. An ordinary kind of place. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You see a closed portmanteau here. Were you looking for a desk? Because look over there, it's a desk. But there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the desk.

There is an unguarded exit to the east. There is an unguarded exit to the north. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

-= Bedroom =-
You've entered a bedroom. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?



There is an open portal leading south. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

-= Cookery =-
You are in a cookery. A normal one. You begin to take stock of what's here.



You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

-= Washroom =-
Well, here we are in a washroom. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

You make out a locked dresser. You can see a bench. But there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You scan the room, seeing a table. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a table? But there isn't a thing on it. Sometimes, just sometimes, TextWorld can just be the worst.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

-= Restroom =-
You are in a restroom. It seems to be pretty ordinary here. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

You see a rack. The rack is usual. But the thing is empty. Hopefully, this discovery doesn't ruin your TextWorld experience!

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. There is an unblocked exit to the south. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a TextWorld game and needs to navigate through different rooms to retrieve a keycard from the bar's floor. The initial instructions mention moving east, then north, west, etc., but the current scenario shows the player has moved through Salon → Bedroom → Cookery → Washroom → Restroom. The next step is to figure out the correct path to reach the bar and get the keycard.

Looking at the current room, Restroom, the exits are east and south. The previous steps involved moving west multiple times, which might be part of a loop. The user needs to avoid getting stuck in a cycle. The key is to find the right sequence of moves that leads to the bar. Since the keycard is in the bar, the player must reach the bar's location. The previous moves might have been going west repeatedly, but that's not leading anywhere. So, the next logical step is to go south from the Restroom to exit to the next room. Then, from there, proceed to the bar. But the user needs to check the exits again. The next action should be to go south from the Restroom to continue the journey towards the bar.

-= Shower =-
You find yourself in a shower. An ordinary kind of place.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.
