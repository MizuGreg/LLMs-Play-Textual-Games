THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to solve this game. The user mentioned that the goal is to retrieve the frisbee from the floor of the closet. Let me check the steps again.

First, the initial instructions said to go north, then north again, then east, north, west, north, east, south, south, east, south, etc. But I ended up looping between the Kitchen and Dish-Pit. Hmm.

Looking at the current location, I'm in the Kitchen again. The previous steps led me back here. The problem is that I keep going north and south between these two rooms without making progress. I need to find a different approach.

Wait, the user mentioned that after certain movements, I need to retrieve the frisbee from the closet. But in the Dish-Pit, there's a locked case and a bowl, but nothing else. Maybe I need to find a key or unlock something. Earlier, in the Cubicle, there was a passkey on the floor. Maybe I need to pick it up and use it to open the locked case in the Dish-Pit?

But how do I get to the closet? The path mentioned was after moving east from the Kitchen. Let me check the rooms again. The Kitchen has an exit to the east. If I go east from the Kitchen, maybe that leads to the closet. But in the Dish-Pit, the exit to the east is unblocked. Wait, maybe I need to go east from the Kitchen once more to reach the closet. But I keep looping between Kitchen and Dish-Pit because of the north-south movement. 

Alternatively, maybe I should try to collect the passkey from the Cubicle and use it to open the locked case in the Dish-Pit. Then, perhaps find the closet. But how to get there? The initial path required moving east after certain steps. Maybe I need to go east from the Kitchen now. Let me try that.
