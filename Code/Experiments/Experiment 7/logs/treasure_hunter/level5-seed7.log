Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First step, go to the south. With that accomplished, move east. Then, lift the key from the floor of the dish-pit. That's it!

-= Parlor =-
You've entered a parlor.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Lounge =-
You've just sauntered into a lounge.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north.

There is a keycard on the floor.

-= Dish-Pit =-
Wow! You're in a dish-pit.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unblocked exit to the south. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

There is a key on the floor.
