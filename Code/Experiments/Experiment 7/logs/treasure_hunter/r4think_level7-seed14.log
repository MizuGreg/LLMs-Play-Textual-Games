Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to make an effort to take a trip west. That done, try to move south. And then, make an effort to take a trip west. With that done, recover the nest of bugs from the floor of the office. Got that? Good!

-= Chamber =-
Well, here we are in the chamber.



You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Canteen =-
You arrive in a canteen. An usual one.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Cellar =-
You've just walked into a cellar. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. There is an unguarded exit to the north. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Office =-
You arrive in an office. An usual kind of place.



There is an unblocked exit to the east.

There is a nest of bugs on the floor.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to recover the nest of bugs from the floor of the office. So far, the steps taken are: go west from the chamber to the canteen, then south to the cellar, then west again to the office. Now, in the office, there's a nest of bugs on the floor. The next step should be to pick up the nest. But the available exits are east and the nest is on the floor. Wait, the user needs to interact with the nest. Since the command "take nest of bugs" isn't listed, maybe the correct action is to pick it up. But the game might require using "take" or "get". However, the previous actions were all movement commands. The user is in the office, and the nest is there. So the next step is to take the nest. But the system message says to output only the command. So the answer should be "take nest of bugs".
