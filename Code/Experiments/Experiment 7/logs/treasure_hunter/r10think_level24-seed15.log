Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First stop, go west. And then, try to head south. After that, make an attempt to venture west. Next, attempt to travel north. Following that, try to take a trip north. And then, attempt to go to the north. That done, venture east. Following that, make an effort to take a trip north. If you can finish that, lift the loaf of bread from the floor of the dish-pit. Got that? Good!

-= Lounge =-
You find yourself in a lounge. A normal kind of place. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?



You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Pantry =-
This might come as a shock to you, but you've just walked into a pantry. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You make out a shelf. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the shelf.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

-= Bedchamber =-
You arrive in a bedchamber. A typical one. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a bookshelf. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a bar. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

-= Washroom =-
You arrive in a washroom. An usual kind of place. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You can see a bench. On the bench you can make out a latchkey.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.
