Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to travel south. That done, make an effort to go west. And then, lift the desktop computer from the floor of the austere workshop. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Closet =-
You've just shown up in a closet.



There is an open door leading north. There is an open gateway leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

-= Serious Cubicle =-
You arrive in a serious kind of place. That is to say, you're in a cubicle.

You make out a locked case right there by you. You can see a display. The display is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! What's that over there? It looks like it's a cabinet. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a desk. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well

There is an open gateway leading north. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

-= Austere Workshop =-
You find yourself in a workshop. An austere one.

You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a coffer.

There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

There is a desktop computer on the floor.

That's not a verb I recognise.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user needs to lift the desktop computer in the Austere Workshop. They tried "lift desktop computer" but got an error. So, maybe the correct verb is "pick up" instead of "lift"? Let me check the previous steps.

First, they went south from the closet, then west to the serious cubicle, then west again to the workshop. Now in the workshop, the desktop computer is on the floor. The goal is to lift it to win. The system didn't recognize "lift", so maybe the correct action is "pick up" or "take". Let me try "pick up desktop computer" next.
