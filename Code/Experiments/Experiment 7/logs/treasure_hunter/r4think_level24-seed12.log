Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to make an attempt to travel west. Then, make an attempt to take a trip south. Okay, and then, venture east. Then, try to take a trip east. If you can do that, make an attempt to move east. After that, travel south. And then, try to move south. Then, make an effort to venture west. Then, recover the desktop computer from the floor of the austere workshop. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Cubicle =-
You are in a cubicle. A standard kind of place.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. There is an unguarded exit to the north. There is an unblocked exit to the south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Salon =-
You've just shown up in a salon.

What's that over there? It looks like it's a bookshelf. The bookshelf is typical. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the bookshelf.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

-= Playroom =-
You're now in a playroom. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."

You can see a closed locker. You can see a portmanteau. The portmanteau is empty, what a horrible day!

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let me try to figure out how to solve this game. The user's goal is to recover the desktop computer from the floor of the austere workshop. So first, I need to follow the steps they mentioned: go west, then south, east, east again, south, south, west, and then get the computer.

Starting from the cubicle, the first action was go west, which took them to the salon. Then go south to the playroom. Now, in the playroom, the next step according to the initial instructions was to venture east. But the user tried going south again, which might not be the right path. Let me check the current location: playroom. The possible exits are east, north, south. The user needs to move towards the workshop. Maybe going east from the playroom would be the next step. But the user tried south again, which might not be helpful. Wait, the initial steps after the cubicle were: go west (to salon), then south (to playroom). Then the next step was to venture east. So from the playroom, going east would be the next move. But the user's last action was go south, which might have been a mistake. So the next step should be to go east from the playroom. Then, after that, proceed as per the steps: east again, south, south, west, then get the computer. But I need to make sure not to loop. The user is in the playroom now. The exits are east, north, south. The correct next step is east. So the next action should be go east.

-= Silent Cubicle =-
You find yourself in a cubicle. A silent kind of place.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

-= Shower =-
You're not going to believe this, but you've just entered a shower. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.



There is an open hatch leading north. There is an open portal leading south. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.



>                                                                                                                                -= Shower =-0/6

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to recover the desktop computer from the workshop. So far, the path taken has been: cubicle -> salon -> playroom -> silent cubicle -> cubicle again -> shower. The next steps according to the initial instructions were to go east, then east again, south, south, west, and then get the computer. But now, in the shower, the exits are north, south, and west. The user needs to move towards the workshop. The previous actions might have looped between cubicles, so the next step should be to go south from the shower. That's the next exit in the sequence. So the next action is go south.

-= Cookhouse =-
Well, here we are in the cookhouse.

What's that over there? It looks like it's a board. The board is normal. The board appears to be empty. You think about smashing the board to bits, throwing the bits into a pit, etc, until you get bored.

There is an open passageway leading east. There is an open portal leading north. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

You find yourself in a workshop. An austere one.

You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a coffer.

There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

There is a desktop computer on the floor.

Okay, let's see. The user's goal is to recover the desktop computer from the austere workshop. The previous steps have led them to the Austere Workshop where the computer is on the floor. The next step should be to pick up the computer. But the command options here are going east, north, or maybe interacting with the coffer. Wait, the user is supposed to take the computer from the floor. So the correct action here is to take the desktop computer. But in the game's context, maybe the command is "take desktop computer" or something similar. However, the user's previous actions were moving around, so the next step is to interact with the computer. The answer should be to take the computer.
