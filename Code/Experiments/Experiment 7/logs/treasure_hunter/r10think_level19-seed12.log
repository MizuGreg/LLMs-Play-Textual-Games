It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First thing I need you to do is to travel south. Next, travel west. That done, pick-up the fly larva from the floor of the cookhouse. That's it!

-= Study =-
Of every study you could have walked into, you had to come round an usual one. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You see a locked coffer. You make out a trunk. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You scan the room for a stand, and you find a stand. The stand is typical. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is a closed gate leading west. There is an open gateway leading east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

-= Vault =-
You make a grand eccentric entrance into a vault. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You see a suitcase. You make out a counter. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the counter.

You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Study and Vault rooms. The goal is to pick up the fly larva from the cookhouse. The initial instructions said to go south, then west, then pick up the larva.

Looking at the history, the user keeps going back and forth between Study (south) and Vault (north). The problem is that the Vault and Study rooms are probably the same or connected in a way that doesn't lead to the cookhouse. The cookhouse isn't mentioned in the current descriptions. The user needs to find the cookhouse, which might be accessible via the west gate mentioned in the Study room. But the user keeps going north and south, not exploring west.

Wait, in the Study room, there's a closed gate leading west. The user hasn't tried going west yet. Maybe the cookhouse is through that gate. But the user kept going south to Vault and back. So the next step is to go west from the Study room instead of south. But the user's previous actions were going south, then north, creating a loop. The key is to break the loop by going west instead of south. So the next action should be to go west from the Study room to reach the cookhouse and pick up the larva.
</think>go west

-= Cookhouse =-
You're now in the cookhouse.

You can make out a locked case, which looks usual, in the room.

There is a closed portal leading north. There is an open hatch leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a fly larva on the floor.
