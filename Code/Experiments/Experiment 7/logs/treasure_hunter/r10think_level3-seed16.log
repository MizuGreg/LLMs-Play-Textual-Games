I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is how to play! First of all, make an effort to move west. Okay, and then, retrieve the fondue from the floor of the studio. Alright, thanks!

-= Steam Room =-
You arrive in a steam room. An usual kind of place. You begin looking for stuff.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

There is a cashew on the floor.

-= Studio =-
A rusty sign tells you that you are now in the studio. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

There is a fondue on the floor.
