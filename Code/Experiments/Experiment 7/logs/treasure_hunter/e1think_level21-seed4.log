Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, make an attempt to take a trip south. With that done, venture east. After that, retrieve the frisbee from the floor of the closet. That's it!

-= Pantry =-
You've entered a pantry. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You scan the room for a safe, and you find a safe. The safe is empty, what a horrible day!

There is an open gate leading south. There is an unguarded exit to the east. There is an unblocked exit to the north. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

-= Cookery =-
You are in a cookery. An ordinary kind of place. Let's see what's in here.

You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a rack. You wonder idly who left that here. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well

There is an open gate leading north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. There is an unguarded exit to the south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text-based game where they need to follow specific steps to reach the goal. The initial instructions were to go south, then east, then retrieve the frisbee from the closet.

First, the user started in the pantry, went south to the cookery. Now, in the cookery, the available exits are north, south, east, west. The next step according to the original plan was to go east. But the user might be stuck in a loop if they keep moving between rooms without progress. 

Looking at the current room (cookery), the user needs to find the closet mentioned in the original task. The frisbee is in the closet's floor. So maybe the closet is in the cookery room. The user hasn't checked the closet yet. 

Wait, the original instructions said to go south (from pantry to cookery), then east. But in the cookery, the user can go east. So the next step should be to go east from cookery. But the user might be confused because the previous action was going south, and now they're in cookery. The next step is to go east as per the original plan. However, the user might have already tried that. Let me check the history again.

The user's first action was "go south" from pantry. Then they are in cookery. The next step according to the original plan is to go east. But the user's next move should be to go east. However, the user might be in a loop if moving east leads back to a previous room. But according to the current room description, the cookery has an exit to the east. So the user should go east from cookery. Then, once in the next room, they need to find the closet and retrieve the frisbee. 

But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action is to go east from cookery. The user's previous actions were go south, then they are in cookery. The next step is to go east. So the answer should be "go east".
</think>go east

-= Closet =-
You find yourself in a closet. A normal kind of place.



There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

There is a frisbee on the floor.

Okay, let's see. The user wants me to figure out the next action in this text-based game. Let me recap the steps so far.

The original goal was to go south, then east, then retrieve the frisbee from the closet. So far, the user first went south from the pantry to the cookery, then east to the closet. Now they're in the closet, and there's a frisbee on the floor. The next step should be to pick up the frisbee. But the game's response says there's an exit to the south and west. Wait, the user's last action was going east, which led them to the closet. The goal was to retrieve the frisbee from the closet's floor. So the next logical step is to pick up the frisbee. But the game's prompt says "There is a frisbee on the floor." So the command should be to take the frisbee. But the user's previous actions were moving directions. Maybe the correct command here is "take frisbee" or "get frisbee". The user needs to pick it up. The previous steps were moving to the closet, so now the action is to take the frisbee. The answer should be "take frisbee".
</think>take frisbee
