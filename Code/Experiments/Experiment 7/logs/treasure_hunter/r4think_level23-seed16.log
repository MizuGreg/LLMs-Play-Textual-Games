You are now playing a fast paced game of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First off, make an effort to venture north. With that done, try to go to the north. With that done, go east. And then, venture north. Then, take a trip north. Then, go west. That done, retrieve the stick of butter from the floor of the kitchenette. That's it!

-= Cookery =-
You've just sauntered into a cookery.

You scan the room for a chest, and you find a chest. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? Look over there! a platter. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You can make out a saucepan. The saucepan is typical. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north.

-= Scullery =-
You find yourself in a scullery. A standard one.

Hey, want to see a fridge? Look over there, a fridge. The fridge is empty, what a horrible day! You can make out a bowl. The bowl is typical. The bowl appears to be empty. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

-= Cellar =-
You are in an usual kind of place. That is to say, you're in a cellar. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a rack. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing hasn't got anything on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the rack. You can make out a workbench. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Hm. Oh well

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

-= Office =-
You find yourself in an office. A typical kind of place.

A closed coffer is right there by you.

There is an open door leading east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to retrieve the stick of butter from the kitchenette floor. So far, they've moved north from the cookery to the scullery, then north again to the cellar, then east to the office. Now, they're in the office. The next step according to the initial instructions was to go west, but the user hasn't done that yet. Wait, the original task said after going east, venture north again, then take a trip north, then go west. Wait, maybe I need to retrace.

Wait, the initial instructions were: venture north, then go north again, then east, then north again, then west. Then retrieve the stick of butter. But the user's path so far is cookery -> scullery (north), then cellar (north again), then east to office. So from the office, the next step according to the original plan would be to go west. But the office has an exit to the west, which is unblocked. So maybe going west from the office would take them back to the cellar? But the user needs to get to the kitchenette. Alternatively, maybe the office is part of the path to the kitchenette.

Wait, the original plan was after going east (from the cellar), then venture north. But in the current state, the user is in the office. The office has an exit to the north, which is unblocked. So maybe going north from the office would take them to the next area. But the user's goal is to get to the kitchenette. Alternatively, maybe the office is part of the path to the kitchenette. Let me check the previous steps again.

The user's path: cookery (start) -> scullery (north) -> cellar (north) -> office (east). Now, from the office, the possible exits are north, south, west. The user needs to find the kitchenette. The original plan said after going east (from cellar), venture north. But the user is in the office now. Maybe the next step is to go north from the office to reach the next area, which might be the kitchenette. Alternatively, maybe the office is part of the path to the kitchenette. But the user hasn't yet reached the kitchenette. So the next step would be to go north from the office. But the user's previous actions didn't include that. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west from the office to return to the cellar and then find another path. But the original plan said after going east (from cellar), then venture north. So perhaps the user is supposed to go north from the office. But the user is in the office now. Let me check the current room description.

In the office, the exits are east (open door), north (unblocked), south (unguarded), and west (unblocked). The user needs to get to the kitchenette. The kitchenette is mentioned in the initial task as the place where the stick of butter is on the floor. So maybe the user needs to go north from the office to reach the kitchenette. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next step would be to go north from the office. But the user's previous actions didn't include that. Alternatively, maybe the user is in a loop. Let me check if going north from the office leads to a place that's part of the path to the kitchenette. If the user goes north from the office, they might reach the kitchenette. So the next action should be go north.

-= Pantry =-
You arrive in a pantry. A standard kind of place.

You scan the room for a stand, and you find a stand. The stand is typical. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.

There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

-= Dish-Pit =-
You've just sauntered into a dish-pit. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

Look over there! a freezer. You shudder, but continue examining the room.

There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.



>                                                                                                                                -= Dish-Pit =-0/6

-= Kitchenette =-
Well, here we are in a kitchenette.

You can make out a locked cabinet close by.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

There is a stick of butter on the floor.

Okay, let's see. The user's goal is to retrieve the stick of butter from the kitchenette floor. So far, they've navigated through several rooms: cookery, scullery, cellar, office, pantry, dish-pit, and now the kitchenette. In the kitchenette, they noticed the stick of butter on the floor but couldn't take it. The error message says "You can't see any such thing." Hmm, maybe the butter is hidden or requires a specific action to pick it up.

Looking back at the steps, the user followed the initial instructions: go north, then north again, east, north, west, and now in the kitchenette. The next step was to take the butter, but that didn't work. Maybe the butter is in a different location or needs to be interacted with in a different way. Since the user is in the kitchenette, perhaps they need to open a cabinet or check another area. The locked cabinet mentioned might be related. Alternatively, maybe the butter is under a dish or in a container that needs to be opened. The user might need to use a synonym for "take," like "pick up" or "pick the stick of butter up." Alternatively, they might need to check the cabinet for the butter. Since the cabinet is locked, maybe they need a key, but that's not mentioned. The user might need to try a different verb or action to retrieve the butter.
</think>pick the stick of butter up
