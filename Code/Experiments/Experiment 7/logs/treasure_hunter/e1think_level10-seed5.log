Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First off, head north. After that, try to go to the east. If you can finish that, take a trip south. Then, make an attempt to go to the east. After that, pick-up the fondue from the floor of the cookhouse. Got that? Good!

-= Bedroom =-
You've entered a bedroom.



There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Kitchenette =-
You arrive in a kitchenette. An ordinary kind of place. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text-based game where they need to follow specific directions to reach the fondue in the cookhouse. The current location is the Kitchenette.

First, the goal is to go north, then east, then south, then east again, and finally pick up the fondue. So far, the user has gone north from the Bedroom to the Kitchenette. The next step according to the initial instructions was to go east. But in the current prompt, the user is in the Kitchenette, and the exits are east and south. The user is told to try going east again after going south. Wait, the original instructions said after going north, try east, then south, then east again, then pick up the fondue.

Wait, the user's previous action was "go north" from the Bedroom, leading to the Kitchenette. The next step in the original plan was to go east. But the current prompt shows that in the Kitchenette, there's an exit to the east and a note to try going south. The user might be stuck in a loop between east and south. Let me check the steps again.

Original plan: Head north (done), then east (next step), then south, then east again, then pick up fondue. But in the Kitchenette, after going north, the user is told to try east. However, the current state shows that after going north, the user is in the Kitchenette, and the next instruction is to go east. But the user might have tried going east and then south, which might be looping. The user needs to go east again after going south. Wait, the original instructions say after going north, try east. Then, after that, take a trip south. Then, make an attempt to go east again. So the sequence is: north, east, south, east, then pick up fondue.

But in the current state, the user is in the Kitchenette. The exits are east and south. The user has already gone north once. The next step according to the plan is to go east. But the user might have tried going east and then south, which might not be the right path. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east again after going south. Wait, the original instructions say after going north, try east. Then, take a trip south. Then, make an attempt to go east again. So after going north, go east (to maybe the cookhouse?), then south, then east again to reach the cookhouse's east side, then pick up the fondue.

But in the current state, the user is in the Kitchenette. The exits are east and south. The user needs to go east first. But the prompt says "try to go to the east. After that, pick-up the fondue from the floor of the cookhouse." Wait, maybe the user is supposed to go east from the Kitchenette to reach the cookhouse, then go south, then east again, then pick up the fondue. But the user is in the Kitchenette, so the next step is to go east. However, the user might have already tried that and is stuck. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go south first, then east. But the original plan says after going north, go east, then south, then east again. So the user is in the Kitchenette, so the next step is to go east. But the user might be in a loop between east and south. So the user needs to go east again, but the system is indicating that after going north, the next step is east. So the correct next action is to go east from the Kitchenette.

-= Study =-
You've just sauntered into a study.



There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

There is a disk on the floor.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in TextWorld. The goal is to follow a specific sequence of movements and pick up the fondue from the cookhouse.

First, they started in the bedroom, went north to the kitchenette. Then they went east to the study. Now they're in the study, which has exits to south and west. There's a disk on the floor. The next step according to the initial instructions was to go south after going east, but the user might be getting stuck here.

Wait, the original plan was: go north, then east, then south, then east again, then pick up the fondue. But in the current room (study), the exits are south and west. The user needs to go south to maybe reach the cookhouse. But the disk is here. Maybe the disk is a red herring, or perhaps the fondue is in another room. The user needs to check if the cookhouse is accessible from here. Since the previous steps didn't mention the cookhouse, maybe the user needs to go west from the study to find the cookhouse. But the initial instructions said to go east again after going south. Hmm, maybe the user is in a loop between rooms. The key is to avoid repeating actions that don't progress. The next action should be to go south to check if that leads to the cookhouse where the fondue is. Alternatively, maybe the disk in the study is part of the puzzle, but the main goal is the fondue. So the next step is to go south from the study to proceed towards the cookhouse.
</think>go south

-= Chamber =-
You're now in the chamber. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.



>                                                                                                                                -= Chamber =-0/4

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text-based game where they need to follow specific directions to reach the cookhouse and pick up the fondue. Let me track their progress.

First, they started in the bedroom, went north to the kitchenette. Then they went east to the study, then south to the chamber. Now, in the chamber, the prompts mention exits to east and north. The goal is to get to the cookhouse, pick up the fondue.

Wait, the user hasn't picked up the fondue yet. The initial instructions said after going east twice, then pick up the fondue from the cookhouse. But the current location is the chamber. Maybe the cookhouse is in the chamber? Or perhaps the user needs to navigate further.

In the chamber, the exits are east and north. The user needs to find the cookhouse. Maybe going east from the chamber leads to the cookhouse. Alternatively, maybe the cookhouse is in the study or kitchenette. But the user hasn't checked those areas yet. Wait, in the study, there's a disk on the floor. Maybe that's a clue, but the goal is the fondue.

The user's previous steps: bedroom -> kitchenette -> study -> chamber. The next step would be to check the exits in the chamber. The prompt says to try going east or north. Let's check if going east from the chamber leads to the cookhouse. If not, maybe north. But the user needs to pick up the fondue, which is in the cookhouse. So perhaps the cookhouse is connected to the chamber. The user needs to go east or north from the chamber to reach the cookhouse and pick up the fondue.

Since the user is in the chamber, the next action should be to go east or north. The previous actions didn't lead to the cookhouse yet, so the user needs to proceed. The correct next step is to go east from the chamber.

-= Cookhouse =-
You have fallen into the most typical of all possible cookhouses.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

There is a fondue on the floor.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to follow a specific sequence of movements and pick up the fondue. So far, they've gone north from the bedroom to the kitchenette, then east to the study, south back to the chamber, and then east again to the cookhouse. The last step was entering the cookhouse, where the fondue is on the floor.

The next step according to the original instructions was to pick up the fondue. But the user hasn't done that yet. The current location is the cookhouse, and the fondue is there. So the next action should be to pick up the fondue. However, the system message says to only output the command, nothing else. So the correct command here is "take fondue" or "pick up fondue". But in the game's context, the exact command might be "take fondue" since that's the standard verb. Let me check the previous interactions. The user was told to "pick-up the fondue from the floor of the cookhouse." So the correct command is "take fondue" or "pick up fondue". The game might expect "take" as the verb. So the next action is to take the fondue.
</think>take fondue
