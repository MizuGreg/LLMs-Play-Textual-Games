Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an exciting round of TextWorld? You do! First of all, you could, like, pick-up the type A passkey from the floor of the still cubicle. And then, unlock the type A door. Then, open the type A door. And then, go to the south. With that over with, try to venture west. If you can do that, try to travel west. Then, attempt to venture south. And then, try to travel east. Following that, go to the east. Next, try to go to the east. With that accomplished, make an attempt to take a trip south. Okay, and then, go to the south. Following that, head west. And then, lift the printer from the floor of the austere workshop. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Still Cubicle =-
You find yourself in a cubicle. A still kind of place.

You make out a desk. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The desk is ordinary. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.

There is a closed type A door leading south. There is an unblocked exit to the east.

There is a type A passkey on the floor.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to solve this TextWorld game. The goal is to pick up the type A passkey, unlock the type A door, go south, then west, south again, east, etc., and finally take the printer from the austere workshop to win.

First, the user tried to pick up the passkey but got an error. Then they tried to unlock the door, but the game didn't recognize the passkey. So the user tried picking up the passkey again, but it's not working. The problem is that the game isn't accepting "pick-up" as a verb. Maybe the correct verb is "take" instead of "pick-up". 

Looking at the game's response when they tried "pick-up type A passkey", it said "That's not a verb I recognise." So the correct command should be "take type A passkey" instead. Then, after taking it, they need to use it to unlock the door. But the game might require the correct syntax for using the key. 

So the next step is to use the passkey to unlock the door. The user might have tried "unlock type A door" but didn't use the key. So after taking the key, they should try "use type A passkey on type A door" or something similar. 

But the user is stuck in a loop because they keep getting errors. The key is to use the right verbs. The correct action here is to take the passkey first, then use it to unlock the door. The previous attempts used "pick-up" which isn't valid, so changing to "take" might work. Then, after unlocking, proceed to go south and follow the steps mentioned.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a TextWorld game where they need to collect items and navigate through different rooms to win. The goal is to pick up the type A passkey, unlock the door, go through various directions, and eventually take the printer from the austere workshop.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Cubicle again after trying to go west. They've already picked up the passkey, unlocked the door, and moved south to the Shower room, then back to the Cubicle. The next steps mentioned in the initial instructions were to venture west, then south, east, etc., but the user is stuck in a loop between the Cubicle and Shower.

The user's past actions include picking up the passkey, unlocking the door, going south, west, and back. The problem is that the game is recognizing "go west" as valid in the Cubicle, but the user might be repeating steps without making progress. The key is to find a new path or use a different verb if "go" isn't working.

Since the user is in the Cubicle again, the next step should be to try moving east, as per the initial plan. The previous attempt to go west led back to the Cubicle, so maybe trying east would lead to a new area. The user needs to avoid loops by exploring different directions and ensuring they follow the correct sequence of actions as outlined in the initial instructions.

First, the steps are: pick up passkey, unlock door, go south, west, south, east, etc., then take the printer. So far, they've picked up the passkey, unlocked the door, and moved between rooms but haven't reached the workshop.

The loop is between Cubicle and Shower. The user tried going west and east, but it's not moving forward. Maybe they need to find another exit or use a different verb. The game might not accept "go" again, so maybe "move" or "travel". But the previous attempt was "go west", which worked but led back. Maybe the next step is to try going south from the Shower again, but the portal is open. Alternatively, check if there's another item or way to proceed. The key is to avoid repeating the same action and find a new path.

The loop is between Cubicle and Salon. The user tried going east and west multiple times. The next step should be to find a new path or use a different verb. Since "go east" and "go west" aren't working, maybe trying "move north" from the Salon. But the user is in the Cubicle again. The key is to avoid repeating the same actions and find a new exit.

FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is trying to navigate through various rooms in the game to reach the austere workshop and take the printer. The goal is to follow the steps mentioned earlier: pick up the passkey, unlock the door, go through specific directions, and finally take the printer.

Looking at the current state, the user has been looping between the Studio, Salon, Bedroom, and Cubicle. They've tried going east, west, north, and south multiple times without making progress. The key is to break this loop and find a new path.

The user needs to find the austere workshop, which is mentioned in the initial instructions. So far, they haven't reached that area. The next step should be to look for a way to get to the workshop. Since the current rooms don't mention the workshop, maybe they need to explore other exits or use a different verb. The previous actions have been repetitive, so changing the approach is necessary. The correct next move might be to go south from the Bedroom to reach the Cubicle again, but that's already been tried. Alternatively, check if there's another exit or item that can help progress.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

You are in a cubicle. A standard kind of place.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. There is an unguarded exit to the north. There is an unblocked exit to the south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

You've entered a studio.

You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an armchair. The armchair is typical. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You think about smashing the armchair to bits, throwing the bits into the garbage, etc, until you get bored. You can make out a stand. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. This always happens!

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.
