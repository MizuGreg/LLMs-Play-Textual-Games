THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is playing a text-based game where they need to follow specific directions to reach the basement and pick up a cucumber. The current location is the Lounge, and they've already gone north from the Kitchenette.

First, the goal is to pick up the cucumber in the basement. The initial steps mentioned were: go north, then west, then south, then west again, and finally pick up the cucumber. So far, the user has gone north from the Kitchenette to the Lounge. The next step according to the initial plan was to venture west from the Lounge. But the user hasn't done that yet.

Looking at the current location, the Lounge has an exit to the south and west. The user needs to go west from here. But wait, the initial instruction said after going north, venture west, then travel south, then go west again. So after arriving in the Lounge, the next step should be west. However, the user might be in a loop if they keep moving between rooms without progressing. But since they're in the Lounge for the first time, going west is the next logical step. The user hasn't picked up the cucumber yet, so they need to proceed to the basement. The next action should be to go west from the Lounge. Let me check if that's the correct direction. The initial plan says after going north (to Lounge), venture west. So yes, go west from Lounge. Then, after that, travel south, then west again to reach the basement. So the next step is to go west.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in a text-based game. The goal is to pick up the cucumber from the basement. Let me recap the steps they've taken so far.

First, they started in the Kitchenette, went north to the Lounge, then west to the Cookhouse. Now they're in the Cookhouse, which has exits to the east and south. There's a butterfly here, but that's probably not relevant. The next step according to the initial instructions was to go west again from the Lounge, but wait, the user just went west from the Lounge to the Cookhouse. Wait, the original plan was: go north, then west, then south, then west again to reach the basement. But in the current scenario, they're in the Cookhouse. Let me check the path again.

Original steps: Start in Kitchenette. Go north to Lounge. Then venture west (so from Lounge to Cookhouse). Then travel south (from Cookhouse to maybe the basement? Wait, the Cookhouse has a south exit. So from Cookhouse, going south would take them to the basement. Then from the basement, go west to pick up the cucumber. But the user is currently in the Cookhouse. So the next step should be to go south from Cookhouse to the basement. Then from the basement, go west to get the cucumber. But the user hasn't reached the basement yet. So the next action should be to go south from Cookhouse. But the user's last action was going west from Lounge to Cookhouse. So the next step is to go south from Cookhouse. But the user's last input was "go west" which led them to Cookhouse. Now, the next step is to go south from Cookhouse. However, the user's previous action was going west, and now they're in Cookhouse. So the next step is to go south. But the user's current location is Cookhouse, and the exit to the south is unguarded. So the correct next step is to go south. But the user might be in a loop if they keep moving between rooms without progressing. But in this case, moving south from Cookhouse should take them to the basement, which is part of the plan. So the next action is "go south".

-= Sauna =-
You've just sauntered into a sauna.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

Okay, let me try to figure out the best way to proceed here. The user is in a TextWorld game, and their goal is to pick up the cucumber from the basement. Let me recap the steps they've taken so far.

First, they started in the Kitchenette, went north to the Lounge, then west to the Cookhouse, and then south to the Sauna. Now they're in the Sauna, and the next step according to the initial instructions was to go west again. But the user hasn't picked up the cucumber yet, so maybe they need to find the basement.

Looking at the current location, the Sauna has exits to the east, north, and west. The previous steps were moving north, west, south, and now maybe they need to go west again from the Sauna. But the user might be getting stuck in a loop if they keep moving between rooms without progressing towards the basement.

Wait, the initial plan was: go north, then west, then south, then west again to get to the basement. But the user is now in the Sauna. Let me check the path again. From the Kitchenette (start), go north to Lounge, then west to Cookhouse, then south to Sauna. The next step should be west again from Sauna to get to the basement. But the user hasn't done that yet. However, the user's last action was going south to the Sauna, so the next step should be west from Sauna.

But the user might be in a loop if they keep moving between rooms without reaching the basement. However, according to the initial instructions, the correct path is to go west from the Sauna to reach the basement where the cucumber is. So the next action should be "go west" again. But the user might have already done that, or maybe not. Let me check the previous steps again.

The user's previous actions were: go north (Kitchenette -> Lounge), then west (Lounge -> Cookhouse), then south (Cookhouse -> Sauna). Now, from Sauna, the next step is west to reach the basement. So the next command should be "go west" again. But the user might have already done that, but according to the current location, they are in the Sauna, so going west from there should lead to the basement. Therefore, the next action is "go west".

-= Basement =-
You've come into a typical room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be typical. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the basement. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked.

There is a cucumber on the floor.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is playing a text adventure game and needs to follow specific steps to win. The goal is to pick up the cucumber in the basement.

First, I need to recall the previous steps. The user started by going north from the kitchenette, then west to the lounge, then south to the cookhouse, then west again to the sauna, and then west again to the basement. Now, in the basement, they see a cucumber on the floor. 

The next step according to the initial instructions was to pick up the cucumber. The user has arrived at the basement, which is the correct location. The cucumber is present here, so the next action should be to pick it up. 

Looking at the previous actions, the user has been moving around, but now they're in the right place. The command should be to pick up the cucumber. There's no loop here because they've reached the basement, the target location. So the next action is straightforward: pick up the cucumber.
