It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! First thing I need you to do is to make an effort to go west. And then, assure that the gateway is ajar. After opening the gateway, make an attempt to venture south. After that, lift the stick of butter from the floor of the cubicle. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Closet =-
You are in a standard kind of place. That is to say, you're in a closet. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a suitcase. The suitcase is empty! What a waste of a day!

There is an unguarded exit to the west.

-= Bedroom =-
You've moved into an usual room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be usual. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the bedroom. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.



There is a closed gateway leading south. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text-based game where they need to follow specific steps to win. The goal is to go west, open the gateway, go south, pick up the butter stick, and then win.

First, the user started in the Closet, went west to the Bedroom. Now, in the Bedroom, the next step according to the initial instructions was to assure the gateway is ajar. But the current room is the Bedroom, and the description mentions a closed gateway leading south. The user needs to open that gateway.

Wait, the initial instructions said after going west, assure the gateway is ajar. But in the Bedroom, the gateway is closed. So the next step is to open it. However, the user might not have the right item or method to open it. But the game might require using a specific action like 'open gateway' or 'push gateway' or something else.

But looking at the previous steps, the user went west from the Closet to the Bedroom. Now, in the Bedroom, the gateway is closed. The next step is to open it. The user needs to try opening the gateway. The initial plan was to go west, open the gateway, go south, pick up the butter. So now, after going west, the next step is to open the gateway.

But the user's current location is the Bedroom, and the gateway is south. So the next action should be to open the gateway. However, the game might require using the correct verb. Maybe 'open gateway' is the command. Alternatively, maybe there's a key or item needed. But in the Closet, there's a suitcase, but it's empty. The user hasn't picked up anything yet.

Wait, the user hasn't done the steps yet. The initial steps were: go west (done), open gateway (next step), then go south, then pick up the butter. So in the Bedroom, the next action is to open the gateway. The user needs to try that. So the next command should be 'open gateway south' or 'open gateway'. But the game's prompt says "There is a closed gateway leading south. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east." Wait, that's confusing. The user is in the Bedroom, and the gateway is south but closed. The prompt suggests trying east, but that's not part of the original plan. Wait, maybe there's a loop here. The user might be stuck trying to go east again, but the original plan was to go west, open gateway, go south. So perhaps the user needs to open the gateway first.

But the current room is the Bedroom, and the gateway is south. The user needs to open it. So the next action is to open the gateway. The previous action was going west. So the next step is to open the gateway. The user should try that. If that doesn't work, maybe there's another way, but according to the initial plan, that's the next step. So the next command is 'open gateway'.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to win the game by following specific steps. The goal is to go west, open the gateway, go south, pick up the butter stick, and then win.

First, they started in the closet, went west to the bedroom. Then they tried to open the gateway. The game responded by allowing them to open the gateway. Now, the next step after opening the gateway is to venture south. But in the previous response, after opening the gateway, the user was still in the bedroom. So the next logical step would be to go south. However, the user might have already tried that or maybe there's a loop. Wait, the current prompt shows that after opening the gateway, the user is still in the bedroom. The previous action was opening the gateway, and the next step should be going south. But the user might have tried going east instead. Wait, the initial instruction said after opening the gateway, attempt to venture south. So the next action should be going south. But the user's last action was opening the gateway, so the next step is to go south. Let me check the history again.

The user first went west from the closet to the bedroom. Then, in the bedroom, the prompt said there's a closed gateway leading south and suggested going east. But the user decided to open the gateway. After opening it, the next step is to go south. So the next command should be "go south". But maybe the user is in a loop if they keep trying the same actions. But in this case, the gateway was opened, so going south should be the next step. The user hasn't done that yet. So the next action is go south.

You find yourself in a cubicle. A normal one.



There is an open gateway leading north. There is an open gate leading west.

There is a stick of butter on the floor.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to win the game by following specific steps. Let me break down what's been done so far.

First, they started in the Closet, went West to the Bedroom. Then they opened the gateway south, which led them to the Cubicle. Now they're in the Cubicle, which is the fourth step. The goal is to lift the stick of butter from the floor and then win.

So the steps needed are: go west, open gateway, go south, lift the butter. Wait, the user already did go west, opened the gateway, and went south. Now they're in the Cubicle. The next step is to pick up the butter. But the current prompt says there's a stick of butter on the floor. So the next action should be to pick it up. But the user's previous action was "go south", which led to the Cubicle. Now, in the Cubicle, the next step is to take the butter. So the correct command here is "take butter" or "lift butter". The user needs to do that to win. Let me check the previous interactions. The user was told to "lift the stick of butter from the floor of the cubicle. And once you've done that, you win!" So the next action is to lift it. The user is in the Cubicle now, so the command should be "lift butter".

That's not a verb I recognise.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to win the game by following specific steps. The goal is to go west, open the gateway, go south, lift the stick of butter, and then win.

Looking at the current state: the user is in the Cubicle. The previous action was "lift butter", but that wasn't recognized. The correct action here should be to pick up the butter. Maybe "lift" isn't the right verb here. The game might expect "take" or "pick up" instead. Since "lift" didn't work, the next step is to use a different verb. The user needs to take the butter from the floor. So the correct command should be "take butter" or "pick up butter". But the game's response indicates that "lift" isn't valid, so the synonym would be "take". Therefore, the next action should be "take butter".
