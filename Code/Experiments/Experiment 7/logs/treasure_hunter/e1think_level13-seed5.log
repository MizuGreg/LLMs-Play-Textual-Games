It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, make an attempt to go to the north. And then, make an attempt to venture west. After that, make an effort to venture south. Once you succeed at that, retrieve the chocolate bar from the floor of the chamber. Alright, thanks!

-= Cookhouse =-
Ah, the cookhouse. This is some kind of cookhouse, really great normal vibes in this place, a wonderful normal atmosphere. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.



There is an unguarded exit to the east. There is an unblocked exit to the north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and find a chocolate bar. The initial steps were to go north from the cookhouse, which led them to the study. Now, they're in the study, which has exits to the south and west.

The user's goal is to reach the chocolate bar in the chamber. So far, they've gone north from the cookhouse, which took them to the study. The next step would be to explore the study's exits. The study has a south exit back to the cookhouse and a west exit. Since the original plan was to go north, then west, then south, but they're already in the study, maybe they need to go west next.

Wait, the user's previous action was going north, leading to the study. Now, in the study, the exits are south and west. The next step in the original plan was to venture west. So the next action should be to go west. But the user needs to make sure they're not looping. If they go west from the study, they might reach a new room. Then, after that, they can go south to return to the cookhouse, but the chocolate is in the chamber. Wait, the original instruction said after going north, west, then south, retrieve the chocolate. So maybe after going west from the study, they'd reach a chamber where the chocolate is. But the user is in the study now. So the next step is to go west. Let me check the previous steps again.

The user first went north from the cookhouse to the study. Now, in the study, they need to go west. Then, after that, they would go south from the study to return to the cookhouse, but the chocolate is in the chamber. Wait, maybe the chamber is a different room. The user needs to find the chocolate in the chamber. So after going west from the study, they might enter a chamber where the chocolate is. Then, they can pick it up. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next step is to go west from the study. That's the next action.

-= Kitchenette =-
I just think it's great that you've just entered a kitchenette.

You can see a freezer.

There is an open hatch leading north. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in TextWorld. The goal is to eventually get the chocolate bar from the floor of the chamber. Let me break down the steps they've taken so far.

First, they started in the Cookhouse, went north to the Study. Then from the Study, they went west to the Kitchenette. Now, in the Kitchenette, there are exits to the north, east, and south. The user's next step should be to move in a direction that hasn't been explored yet. The previous actions were north, then west. The next logical step might be to go east or north. But the user has to avoid loops. Since they came from the Study (west), going south would take them back. So maybe go north from the Kitchenette. But wait, the user needs to find the chocolate bar. Maybe the chocolate is in the Study or Cookhouse? But the initial instruction says to go north, then west, then south. Wait, the original task was to go north, then west, then south. But in the current room (Kitchenette), the exits are north, east, south. The user needs to proceed according to the original plan. The original plan was after going north, then west, then south. But the user is now in the Kitchenette. Wait, maybe the sequence was: start in Cookhouse, go north to Study, then west to Kitchenette. Then the next step in the original plan was to go south. But from the Kitchenette, south would lead back to the Study. But the original plan was to go north, then west, then south. So maybe after going west to Kitchenette, the next step is to go south back to Study. But that might not be helpful. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to explore other directions. However, the original task was to go north, then west, then south. So after going west (to Kitchenette), the next step is to go south. But from Kitchenette, south is to the Study. Then from Study, south is back to Cookhouse. But the user's goal is to get the chocolate bar. Maybe the chocolate is in the Study or Cookhouse. But the initial instruction said to go north, then west, then south. So perhaps after going south from Kitchenette, they would be back in the Study, then south again to Cookhouse. But the user needs to find the chocolate. Alternatively, maybe the chocolate is in the Kitchenette. But the user hasn't checked the floor yet. Wait, the original task was to retrieve the chocolate bar from the floor of the chamber. So maybe the chamber is the Study or Cookhouse. But the user hasn't found it yet. So perhaps after exploring the Kitchenette, the next step is to go east to the exit, but that's unblocked. Alternatively, go north from Kitchenette. But the user needs to follow the original plan: go north, west, south. So after west (Kitchenette), the next step is south. So the next action should be 'go south' from Kitchenette. But the user is in Kitchenette, so the command would be 'go south'. However, the user might be in a loop if they keep moving between rooms without progress. But according to the original plan, they need to proceed step by step. So the next action is to go south from Kitchenette.

-= Chamber =-
You make another one of your grand eccentric entrances into a chamber.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the north.

There is a chocolate bar on the floor.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Chamber now, and there's a chocolate bar on the floor. The goal is to retrieve the chocolate bar.

First, I need to recall the steps. The initial instructions were to go north, then west, then south, and then get the chocolate. But the user has already moved through those areas. Now they're in the Chamber, which is the fourth step. The chocolate is here, so the next step is to pick it up.

Wait, the previous actions were go north, then west, then south. Now in the Chamber, the next logical step is to take the chocolate. The command should be 'take chocolate bar' or something similar. But the game might expect a specific wording. Let me check the previous commands. The user was told to "retrieve the chocolate bar from the floor of the chamber." So the correct action here is to take it. The command should be 'take chocolate bar' or 'get chocolate bar'. Since the game's previous responses used 'take', I'll go with that.
</think>take chocolate bar
