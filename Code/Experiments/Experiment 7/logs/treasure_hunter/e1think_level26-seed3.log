Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an exciting round of TextWorld? You do! First off, make an effort to venture west. After that, make an attempt to head north. And then, head east. Following that, make an effort to take a trip north. Then, move west. After that, go to the north. And then, make an effort to move east. After that, head east. And then, attempt to venture south. Then, head south. Following that, attempt to move south. Then, pick up the shadfly from the floor of the laundromat. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Kitchenette =-
Well, here we are in the kitchenette.

A locked freezer is here. You can make out a fridge. The fridge is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You can make out a chair. The chair is usual. The chair appears to be empty. Hm. Oh well You make out a rack. The rack appears to be empty. Hopefully, this discovery doesn't ruin your TextWorld experience!

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

This might come as a shock to you, but you've just come into a shower.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a TextWorld game where they need to follow a series of directions to reach a goal. The initial instructions mention moving west, then north, east, north again, west, north, east, east, south, south, south, and then picking up the shadfly.

Looking at the current environment, the user is in the Shower area. The previous action was "go west", which led them here from the Kitchenette. The current description mentions an exit to the east and suggests trying north since that's unguarded.

The user's goal is to follow the sequence of movements: west, north, east, north, west, north, east, east, south, south, south, then pick up the shadfly. So far, they've done the first step (west) and are now in the Shower. The next step in the sequence is to go north. But the current location's description says that north is unguarded, so that should be possible.

But wait, the user might be in a loop. Let me check the steps again. After moving west from Kitchenette to Shower, the next step in the original instructions was to go north. The Shower's description says north is unguarded, so moving north from here would be the next step. However, if moving north leads back to a previous area, that could be a loop. But according to the initial instructions, after moving west, the next step is north, then east, etc. So the user needs to follow each direction in order.

The user's next action should be to go north from the Shower. But the previous response might have been "go west", and now they're in the Shower. The next step is to go north. However, the user's last action was "go west", and the current step is to go north. So the next command should be "go north".

-= Cookery =-
You arrive in a cookery. An usual kind of place.

You smell a great smell, and follow it to a case. You see a refrigerator. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this?

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in TextWorld. The goal is to follow a specific sequence of movements: west, north, east, north, west, north, east, east, south, south, south, then pick up the shadfly.

So far, the user has gone west from the kitchenette to the shower, then north to the cookery. Now, in the cookery, the next steps according to the initial instructions are to go east, then north, then east again, then east again, then south, south, south, and finally pick up the shadfly.

But in the current room (cookery), the available exits are east, north, and south. The user needs to go east first. However, the previous action was going north from the shower to the cookery. The next step in the sequence is to go east. But the user might be stuck in a loop if they keep going back and forth. So, the next action should be east. But wait, the user has to make sure they don't repeat actions that don't progress. Let me check the steps again.

The initial instructions said after the first few moves, the user should go south three times and then pick up the shadfly. But in the cookery, the user needs to go east, then north, then east, then east, then south, etc. So the next step is east. But the user might be in a loop if they keep moving between rooms without making progress. However, the current room is cookery, and the next step is east. So the correct next action is east.

-= Restroom =-
You are in a restroom. An ordinary kind of place.

You see an opened cabinet close by. The cabinet is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever!

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out the best way to proceed here. The user is in a TextWorld game and needs to follow a specific sequence of movements and actions to reach the goal. The initial instructions were to move west, then north, east, north again, west, north, east, east, south, south, south, and then pick up the shadfly from the laundromat.

Looking at the current environment, the user is in the Restroom. The previous steps have taken them through the Kitchenette, Shower, Cookery, and now Restroom. The next steps in the original plan were to go south from the Restroom. But the user's last action was "go east" from the Restroom, which might have led them back to a previous area or created a loop.

Wait, the user's current location is the Restroom. The original plan after the Restroom would be to go south. However, the available exits here are east, north, and west. The user needs to move south, but if those exits aren't available, they might be stuck. But according to the prompt, the Restroom has an exit to the east, north, and west. So maybe the user needs to go south from here, but the directions might be different. Alternatively, perhaps the user is in a loop and needs to find a different path.

The user's past actions include moving west, north, east, north, west, north, east, east, and now they're in the Restroom. The next step in the original plan was to go south, but from the Restroom, the exits are east, north, west. So maybe the user needs to find another way to get to the laundromat where the shadfly is. Alternatively, maybe the user is in a loop and needs to try a different direction. Since the original plan was to go south from the Restroom, but that's not an option here, perhaps the user needs to go east again or find another path.

Wait, the original plan after the Restroom was to go south, but the Restroom's exits are east, north, west. So maybe the user needs to go east again, then find a way to get south from there. Alternatively, maybe the user is in a loop and needs to try a different action. Since the previous actions didn't progress, the user should try a different direction. The next step would be to go east again, but the user already did that. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go north from the Restroom to find another exit.

But according to the original plan, after the Restroom, the next step was to go south. However, the Restroom's exits don't include south. So perhaps the user is in a loop and needs to find a different path. The user's next action should be to go east again, but that might not work. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go north from the Restroom to find an exit that leads to the laundromat.

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go east from the Restroom, then north, then east again to reach the laundromat. But the user's previous actions have already included moving east multiple times. The key is to find the shadfly in the laundromat, which is part of the original plan. So the user needs to navigate to the laundromat, which is probably in a different area. The user might need to go east from the Restroom, then north, then east again to reach the laundromat. But the user needs to check the available exits again.

In the Restroom, the exits are east, north, west. So going east from the Restroom would take the user to the next area. The original plan was to go south from the Restroom, but that's not possible. Therefore, the user needs to go east, then find a way to get south from there. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go north from the Restroom to find an exit that leads to the laundromat.

The user's next action should be to go east again, but the user might be in a loop. However, the original plan says after the Restroom, go south, which isn't possible. Therefore, the user needs to adjust their path. The correct next step is to go east from the Restroom, then proceed to find the laundromat. So the next action is "go east".

-= Lounge =-
You arrive in a lounge. A standard kind of place. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a shelf. The shelf is normal. The shelf appears to be empty.

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the south. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

Okay, let's try to figure out the best way to proceed here. The user is in a TextWorld game, and their goal is to navigate through various rooms, following a specific sequence of directions and eventually pick up the shadfly from the laundromat.

Looking at the current room, it's the Lounge. The user has been moving east, west, north, and south in previous rooms. The current room has exits to the north, south, and west. The previous steps mentioned moving west, north, east, north, west, north, east, east, south, south, south, and then picking up the shadfly. But the user is now in the Lounge, and the next step according to the initial instructions was to go south. However, the user might be stuck in a loop, so they need to find a different action.

The user's past actions include moving east, west, north, etc., but they haven't picked up the shadfly yet. The shadfly is in the laundromat, which was mentioned in the first part of the game. The user needs to find the laundromat and pick up the shadfly. However, the current room is the Lounge, and the exits are north, south, and west. The user needs to find the correct path to the laundromat.

Wait, the initial instructions said to venture west, then north, east, north, west, north, east, east, south, south, south, then pick up the shadfly. But the user might have missed some steps. Alternatively, maybe the user is in a loop between rooms and needs to try a different direction. Since the Lounge has an exit to the west, maybe going west from here would lead to another room. But the user needs to reach the laundromat. Alternatively, maybe the user should check if there's a way to go south from the Lounge, as the exit to the south is unguarded. However, the user's previous steps might have already taken them through that path.

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go west from the Lounge to reach the laundromat. But the initial instructions didn't specify that. The user needs to follow the exact steps given: after the initial movements, they need to go south, then south again, and then pick up the shadfly. However, the current room is the Lounge, and the exit to the south is unguarded. So the next step should be to go south. But the user might have already done that. Wait, the initial instructions said after moving east, then east again, then attempt to venture south. So maybe the user is supposed to go south from the Lounge. But the user is in the Lounge now, and the exit to the south is there. So the next action should be to go south. However, the user might be in a loop, so they need to check if going south is the correct next step. If that's not working, maybe try a different direction, like west. But according to the initial plan, after the Lounge, the next step was to go south. So the correct next action is to go south.

Looking at the current location, the Laundromat has a shadfly on the floor. The next step according to the initial instructions was to pick up the shadfly. The user needs to take that action. The previous steps have been moving around, and now they're in the right place. The command should be to pick up the shadfly. But the system might expect a different verb, like 'take' instead of 'pick up'. Let me check the game's possible commands. In TextWorld, common verbs are 'take', 'get', 'pick up', etc. So the correct command here would be 'take shadfly' or 'pick up shadfly'. The user's last action was 'go south', leading them to the Laundromat where the shadfly is present. Now, the next step is to pick it up. The assistant should output the command to take the shadfly.
