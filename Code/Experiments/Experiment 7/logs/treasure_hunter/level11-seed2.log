Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an fast paced round of TextWorld? You do! Your first objective is to try to go west. And then, pick up the latchkey from the floor of the studio. Alright, thanks!

-= Steam Room =-
You find yourself in a steam room. A typical one.

You can make out a box, so there's that. You make out a rack. The rack is typical. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can see a table. The table is normal. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

-= Studio =-
You've just shown up in a studio. You can barely contain your excitement.

Oh, great. Here's a stand. The stand appears to be empty.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

There is a latchkey on the floor.
