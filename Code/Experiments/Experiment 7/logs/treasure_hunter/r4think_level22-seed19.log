Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, you could, like, make an effort to go south. And then, try to head west. After that, make an attempt to venture west. Next, go west. After that, pick-up the key from the floor of the canteen. And once you've done that, you win!
