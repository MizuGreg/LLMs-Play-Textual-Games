It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! First of all, you could, like, make an attempt to go north. That done, go west. After that, move north. Next, take a trip east. That done, go to the east. After that, go south. And then, venture south. And then, take a trip east. If you can manage that, recover the frisbee from the floor of the closet. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Shower =-
Well, here we are in a shower. You begin looking for stuff.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text-based game where they need to follow a specific sequence of movements to recover a frisbee and win. The initial instructions mentioned a series of directions: go north, west, north, east, east, south, south, east. But the current environment is a cookery, and the user has already moved east from the shower.

Looking at the current location, the cookery has exits north, east, south, and west. The previous action was going east from the shower, which led to the cookery. Now, the next step in the original plan was to go west from the shower, but that's not possible anymore since the user is in the cookery now. Wait, maybe the original plan was a sequence that might not align with the current rooms. The user needs to retrace their steps or find alternative paths.

The user's past actions: started in the shower, went east to the cookery. The original plan's first step was to go north from the shower, but the user went east instead. Now, in the cookery, the next step according to the original plan was to go east. But the user is already in the cookery, so maybe the next step is to go north, as per the original plan's second step. Wait, the original plan said after going east, go north. But the user is in the cookery, which has a north exit. So maybe the next step is to go north from the cookery. However, the user needs to check if that's the correct direction. Alternatively, maybe the user is in a loop between the shower and cookery. The original plan's first steps might not be directly applicable now. The user needs to find the frisbee in the closet, so perhaps they need to navigate to the closet's location. But the current room is the cookery, so maybe the next step is to go north to the next room, then proceed as per the original plan. Alternatively, maybe the user is stuck in a loop between the cookery and shower, so they need to find a different path. The user should check the exits again. The cookery has a north, east, south, west exit. The original plan's next step after east was to go north, so maybe that's the next move. But the user needs to ensure they're not repeating actions. Since the previous action was east, maybe the next step is north. But the user needs to confirm if that's the correct direction towards the closet. Alternatively, maybe the user should go west from the cookery to return to the shower, but that might not be part of the original plan. However, the original plan's first step was to go north from the shower, then west, then north, etc. So perhaps the user is off track. The key is to follow the original sequence but adjust if the current room's exits don't align. The next step would be to go north from the cookery, as per the original plan's second step. But the user needs to make sure that's the correct direction. So the next action is go north.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in TextWorld to recover a frisbee from a closet and win the game. The previous steps they took were: go east from the shower, then go north to the cookery, then go north again to the pantry. Now, in the pantry, the available exits are south, east, and north. The prompt suggests going west, but the user has to avoid loops.

First, I need to recall the original goal. The user was told to go north, west, north, east, east, south, south, east, and then retrieve the frisbee. But the current location is the pantry. The next step in the original plan after the pantry would be to go west, but maybe that's part of a loop.

Looking at the current room (pantry), the exits are south, east, north, and west. The user's previous action was going north to the pantry. The prompt says to try going west. But if the user keeps going back and forth between rooms without making progress, they might be in a loop. So, the next action should be to go west, but if that's not working, maybe use a synonym like 'go west' or 'walk west' to break the loop. However, the user needs to follow the exact steps given in the initial instructions. The original plan after the pantry was to go west. So the next step is to go west.

Okay, let's try to figure out the best way to proceed here. The user is in a TextWorld game and needs to follow a specific sequence of movements to recover the frisbee from the closet and win.

First, I need to recall the initial instructions. The user was told to go north, then west, then north again, east, east again, south, south, east, and finally retrieve the frisbee. But the current environment seems to be a parlor with exits to east, north, south, and west. The previous actions taken were: go east (from shower to cookery), go north (to pantry), go west (to parlor). Now, in the parlor, the options are east, north, south, west. The user needs to continue following the original path.

The original plan after the parlor would be to go south (as per the initial steps: after parlor, go south). But the user is in the parlor now. The next step in the original plan was to go south from the parlor. However, the current description says there's an unblocked exit to the south. So the next action should be to go south. But the user might be in a loop if they keep repeating the same directions. However, the original steps don't indicate a loop, so following the initial plan is key.

Wait, the user's previous actions were: shower -> cookery (east), pantry (north), parlor (west). Now, in the parlor, the next step according to the initial instructions was to go south. So the next command should be "go south". But the user might be in a loop if they keep moving between rooms without progress. However, the initial plan specifies moving south from the parlor, so that's the next step.

Okay, let's try to figure out the best way to proceed here. The user is in a TextWorld game where the goal is to recover the frisbee from the closet's floor. The initial instructions mentioned a sequence of directions: go north, west, north, east, east, south, south, east. But the user has been moving through different rooms like the shower, cookery, pantry, and parlor, and now back in the shower.

Looking at the current room description for the shower, the exits are east, north, and west. The user has been going back and forth between the shower and other rooms. The previous steps included going east, north, west, south, which brought them back to the shower. So there's a loop here.

The goal is to get to the closet's floor and retrieve the frisbee. The user needs to find the closet. Since the shower is part of the environment, maybe the closet is in another room. But the current exits don't mention a closet. The user might need to explore other rooms beyond the shower.

In the pantry, there was a safe, but it was empty. The parlor had exits to east and north, and south. The cookery had exits to north, east, south, west. The shower has exits to east, north, west. The user needs to find a path that leads to the closet. Maybe the closet is in the pantry or parlor? Or perhaps the safe in the pantry is related?

But the user's previous actions have led them back to the shower. To break the loop, they need to try a different direction. The shower's exits are east, north, west. They tried east, then north, then west, then south, which brought them back. So maybe instead of going south again, they should try a different direction. But the shower's exits are only east, north, west. Wait, the user is in the shower again. Maybe they need to go east again, but that's where they came from. Alternatively, maybe the closet is in the north direction from the shower. But the north exit from the shower is unguarded. If they go north from the shower, they might enter another room. Let's check the previous steps: when they were in the shower, the first action was east, then north, then west, then south, which brought them back. So perhaps the next step is to go north again from the shower. But that might just loop again. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east again, but that's the same as before. Wait, the user's goal is to get to the closet. Maybe the closet is in the pantry or parlor. The user needs to find a way to get there without looping. The previous steps have them moving between rooms but not making progress. So the next action should be to go north from the shower, even though it's a loop, but maybe that's the way to reach the closet. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west again. But the user has to avoid repeating actions that don't make progress. Since the previous actions led back to the shower, maybe the next step is to go east again, but that's the same as before. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go north from the shower to reach a different room. Let's proceed with that.

Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game where they have to navigate through different rooms and eventually retrieve a frisbee from a closet. The goal is to follow a specific sequence of movements: go north, west, north, east, east, south, south, east, and then get the frisbee.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Parlor again. The previous steps have them moving between rooms, but they seem to be looping between the Shower and Parlor. The challenge is to break this loop and proceed towards the closet where the frisbee is. 

The user's past actions include going east, north, west, south, and north again, which has led them back to the Shower. The next step should be to find a way to proceed towards the closet without getting stuck in a loop. The instruction mentions that if the previous actions aren't making progress, a different action (maybe using a synonym) is needed.

In the Parlor, the available exits are east, north, south, and west. The user has already tried going south, which brought them back to the Shower. Maybe trying a different direction, like west, could lead them to a new area. Alternatively, perhaps there's a hidden path or an object that needs to be interacted with. However, the game's feedback suggests that the user needs to continue moving in the specified sequence.

Wait, the original plan was to go north, west, north, east, east, south, south, east. But the user has already done some of these steps. Now, they need to proceed towards the east again after the last south. But in the current room (Parlor), going east is unblocked. So maybe the next step is to go east again, even though it's part of the loop, to eventually reach the closet. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check if there's a way to get to the closet from the Parlor.

But the game's current state shows that the user is in the Parlor again, so perhaps the correct next step is to go east, following the original plan. However, since the user is looping, they might need to try a different direction. But according to the instructions, if the previous actions didn't make progress, they should use a synonym. However, the available exits are still the same. Maybe the user needs to go west from the Parlor to break the loop. But the original plan didn't include that. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go north again from the Parlor.

Wait, the original steps mentioned going north, west, north, east, east, south, south, east. The user has already done some of these. Now, after the last south, they need to go east again. But in the Parlor, going east is unblocked. So the next step should be east. However, the user is in the Parlor, and the previous action was going south, which brought them back to the Shower. So maybe the correct next step is to go east from the Parlor to proceed towards the closet. But the user has to follow the exact sequence. Let me check the original steps again.

Original steps: go north, west, north, east, east, south, south, east. So after the first two steps (north, west), then north again, then east, east, south, south, east. The user has already done some of these. Now, they are in the Parlor, which is part of the sequence. The next step after the last south (from the Shower) would be to go east again. But in the Parlor, going east is unblocked. So the next action should be east. However, the user is in the Parlor, so maybe the correct next step is to go east again to proceed towards the closet. But the user might be stuck in a loop between the Shower and Parlor. Therefore, the next action should be to go east from the Parlor to break the loop and proceed towards the closet.

Okay, let's try to figure out how to win this game. The user mentioned that the goal is to recover the frisbee from the floor of the closet. So, the steps provided in the initial instructions were: go north, west, north, east, east, south, south, east. But I need to follow the current path and see where I am.

Looking at the history, the player has been moving between rooms: shower, cookery, pantry, parlor, shower again, parlor again, pantry again. It seems like there's a loop between the shower, parlor, and pantry. The user is stuck in a cycle, moving back and forth between these rooms without making progress towards the closet or the frisbee.

In the current room (pantry), the available exits are south, east, north, and west. The previous actions were going east, which led back to the pantry. The user needs to break this loop. Since the same directions are leading back, maybe trying a different action, like examining the room for clues or looking for the closet. But the available commands include 'look' to describe the current room. Maybe the closet is in the pantry, and the frisbee is on the floor. So, the next step should be to look around to find the closet and then retrieve the frisbee.

Wait, the user's past actions have been moving between rooms without exploring. The key is to find the closet and take the frisbee. So, the next action should be to look in the pantry for the closet. But the current room is the pantry, and the description mentions a safe, but no closet. Maybe the closet is in another room. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west from the pantry to find the closet. Let me check the previous steps.

Earlier, in the pantry, the user was told to try going west. But after going west, they ended up in the parlor again. Then from the parlor, going south led back to the shower. So, perhaps the closet is in the parlor or the shower. But the initial goal was the closet's floor. Maybe the user needs to look for the closet in the current room (pantry) or check other rooms. Since the user is stuck in a loop, the next step is to use the 'look' command to examine the pantry for any clues about the closet or the frisbee.

SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let me try to figure out how to win this game. The user's goal is to recover the frisbee from the floor of the closet and then win. The previous steps involved moving through different rooms: shower, cookery, pantry, parlor, and back to shower and pantry. It seems like there's a loop between the shower and pantry areas.

Looking at the current room, which is the pantry, the available exits are south, east, north, and west. The user has been moving east and west, which might be causing the loop. The next step should be to check if there's a way to progress further. The safe in the pantry is empty, so maybe there's something else to find. But the main objective is the frisbee in the closet. 

Wait, the user hasn't mentioned encountering a closet yet. Maybe the closet is in a different area. The previous steps didn't mention a closet, so perhaps the user needs to explore more rooms. However, the current room is the pantry, and the exits are leading back to previous areas. 

Since the user is stuck in a loop, the next action should be to try a different direction. The previous actions were going east and west, so maybe trying north or south. But the pantry has an open gate leading south. Maybe going south from the pantry would lead to a new area. Let me check the available commands again. The user can use 'go south' to move from the pantry. That might be the next step to break the loop and explore new areas.

-= Cookery =-
You are in a cookery. An ordinary kind of place. Let's see what's in here.

You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a rack. You wonder idly who left that here. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well

There is an open gate leading north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. There is an unguarded exit to the south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Okay, let's try to figure out the best way to proceed here. The user is in the Cookery room, and the goal is to recover the frisbee from the closet's floor and win the game. Let me recap the steps mentioned in the initial instructions.

The original plan was: go north, then west, then north again, east, east again, south, south, east. But the user has been moving between rooms, ending up in the Cookery again. The current room is Cookery, and the previous actions included going south from the Pantry, which led back to Cookery.

Looking at the current room description, there's an open gate leading north, an unguarded exit to the east, south, and west. The user needs to navigate through these rooms to find the closet where the frisbee is. The challenge is to avoid loops and find the correct path.

In the Cookery room, the user was advised to try going east. But since the user is repeating rooms, maybe they need to check if there's a different action or if they need to look for objects. However, the available commands include 'look' which could help identify items. But the goal is to move through the rooms as per the initial steps.

The next step after being in Cookery might be to go east again, but if that's leading to a loop, perhaps trying a different direction. However, the initial steps required moving east, then east again. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check the closet in the current room. But the Closet isn't mentioned here. Wait, the original goal was to go to the closet's floor. So perhaps the user needs to find the closet in the current or adjacent rooms.

In the Cookery room, the user might need to look for a closet. But the description doesn't mention one. The previous rooms like the Pantry had a safe, but not a closet. The Shower had an exit to the north and west. Maybe the Closet is in the Parlor or another room. The user needs to follow the initial path: after going south from Pantry to Cookery, then maybe go east to reach the next room, which might be the Closet.

Alternatively, the user might be stuck in a loop between Pantry, Cookery, and Shower. The initial steps required moving east, west, north, etc., but the user needs to follow the exact sequence. The next step after being in Cookery might be to go east, as per the initial plan. But the user has to ensure they don't repeat actions that don't progress. Since the user is in Cookery, the next step would be to go east, then check if that leads to the Closet. If not, maybe try another direction. But according to the initial instructions, after going east from Cookery, the next step was to go to the east again, then south, etc. So the correct next action here is to go east.

-= Closet =-
You find yourself in a closet. A normal kind of place.



There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

There is a frisbee on the floor.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in TextWorld to recover a frisbee from the closet and win the game. The goal mentioned earlier was to follow a specific path: go north, west, north, east, east, south, south, east, then retrieve the frisbee.

Looking at the current room, they're in the Closet. The prompt says there's a frisbee on the floor. The previous steps led them here. The next logical step would be to pick up the frisbee. But the available commands include 'take' and 'pick up'. Since the frisbee is on the floor, using 'take frisbee' or 'pick up frisbee' would be the correct action. The user needs to retrieve it to win. So the next command should be to take the frisbee.
