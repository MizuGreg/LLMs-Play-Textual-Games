Welcome to TextWorld! Here is how to play! First of all, you could, like, make an attempt to go to the south. And then, take a trip west. After that, lift the latchkey from the floor of the studio. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Spare Room =-
You are in a spare room. A standard one. You begin looking for stuff.

You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a shelf. But there isn't a thing on it.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Steam Room =-
You find yourself in a steam room. A typical one.

You can make out a box, so there's that. You make out a rack. The rack is typical. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can see a table. The table is normal. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing TextWorld and needs to figure out the steps to win. The goal, as mentioned in the initial prompt, is to lift the latchkey from the studio floor and then proceed to the next step, which probably involves opening a door or something similar.

First, the user started in the Spare Room. They went south to the Steam Room. Now, in the Steam Room, the description mentions a box, a rack, and a table, but nothing on them. The exits are east, north, west. The hint says to take a trip west after going south. Wait, the initial instruction said go south, then west. But the user already went south once. Now they're in the Steam Room. So the next step should be to go west from here. But the user might be stuck in a loop if they keep going back and forth between rooms. Let me check the previous steps again.

The first step was going south from the Spare Room to the Steam Room. The next step according to the initial instructions was to go west. But in the Steam Room, the exits are east, north, west. So going west from the Steam Room would take them to another room. But the user needs to find the latchkey in the studio. Maybe the studio is a different room. Wait, the initial instruction mentioned the studio's floor. So perhaps the user needs to navigate to the studio room, find the latchkey, and then use it. But the current location is the Steam Room. So the next step is to go west from the Steam Room. Let me check if that's the correct direction. The initial instructions said after going south, take a trip west. So maybe the user is supposed to go west from the Steam Room. But the user is in the Steam Room now, so the next action should be to go west. However, the user might be in a loop if the Steam Room is connected back to the Spare Room. But according to the current description, the Steam Room has exits to east, north, west. So going west from Steam Room would take them to another room, perhaps the Spare Room again? But the user already went south once. Wait, maybe the user needs to go west from the Steam Room to reach the studio. Alternatively, maybe the studio is in a different direction. Let me think again.

The initial instructions said: go south, then west, then lift the latchkey. So after going south to Steam Room, the next step is to go west. So the user should go west from Steam Room. But in the current state, the user is in Steam Room, so the next action is to go west. But the user might have already done that. Wait, the user's previous action was going south. Now, in the Steam Room, the next step is to go west. So the next command should be "go west". But the user needs to make sure they're not looping. If going west leads back to the Spare Room, then maybe they need to find another way. But according to the initial instructions, after going south, then west, then lift the latchkey. So the user needs to go west from Steam Room. Let me check the current description again. The Steam Room has exits to east, north, west. So going west from Steam Room would take them to another room. Maybe the studio is there. So the next action is to go west.

-= Studio =-
You've just shown up in a studio. You can barely contain your excitement.

Oh, great. Here's a stand. The stand appears to be empty.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

There is a latchkey on the floor.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to win the game by following the instructions given. The goal is to lift the latchkey from the floor of the studio and then proceed to the next step.

First, I need to recall the previous steps. The user started in the Spare Room, went south to the Steam Room, then west to the Studio. Now they're in the Studio, and there's a latchkey on the floor. The next step should be to pick up the latchkey.

Wait, the initial instructions mentioned "lift the latchkey from the floor of the studio. And if you do that, you're the winner!" So the key action here is to lift the latchkey. The user is already in the Studio, so the next logical step is to pick it up. The previous actions were moving around, but now the main task is to interact with the latchkey. The user hasn't done that yet, so the next command should be to take or lift the latchkey.

That's not a verb I recognise.

First, the user started in the Spare Room, went south to the Steam Room, then west to the Studio. Now, in the Studio, they see a latchkey on the floor. The previous action was "lift the latchkey", but the game didn't recognize it. So maybe "lift" isn't the correct verb here. Perhaps the correct action is "take the latchkey" or "pick up the latchkey". But the game might expect a different term. Alternatively, maybe "get the latchkey" is the right command. Since "lift" didn't work, the next step is to try a synonym. The user needs to find the right verb to interact with the latchkey. The correct action here is likely "take" or "get". So the next command should be "take the latchkey" or "get the latchkey". But the game might have specific verbs. Let me check the previous steps again. The initial instruction said "lift the latchkey from the floor of the studio". But the game didn't recognize "lift". So maybe the correct verb is "take". Therefore, the next action should be "take the latchkey".
