Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First, it would be fantastic if you could make an attempt to go to the east. And then, try to head north. With that over with, retrieve the teapot from the floor of the canteen. That's it!

-= Basement =-
You arrive in a basement. An ordinary kind of place.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

-= Sauna =-
You've just walked into a sauna. Let's see what's in here.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user wants me to navigate through TextWorld to retrieve the teapot from the canteen's floor. So first, I need to figure out the path from the basement to the canteen.

Starting in the basement, the user went east to the sauna. But the goal is to get to the canteen. The sauna's description mentions unguarded exits to north and west. Wait, the initial instruction said to go east first, then north. But after going east, the sauna is the next room. Now, from the sauna, the options are north or west. The user might be stuck in a loop between sauna and basement.

Wait, the original plan was to go east (from basement to sauna), then north. But the sauna's north exit might lead back to the basement or another area. The user needs to find the canteen. Maybe the canteen is accessible from the sauna's west or north? Or perhaps there's a different path.

Wait, the initial problem mentioned the canteen's floor where the teapot is. So the canteen must be a room that's reachable. The user is in the sauna now. The previous steps were basement -> sauna. From sauna, maybe going west back to basement, but that's where they started. Alternatively, maybe the sauna's north exit leads to another area. But the user needs to get to the canteen. Maybe the canteen is in a different part of the map.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west from the sauna to the basement again, then find another exit. But the basement had an exit to the west. Wait, the basement's description said there's an unguarded exit to the west. So maybe from the basement, going west leads to another area. But the user is in the sauna now. So perhaps the correct path is: basement -> east (sauna), then from sauna, go west back to basement, then from basement, go west again? But that seems like a loop.

Wait, the user's goal is to retrieve the teapot from the canteen's floor. So the canteen must be a room that's reachable. Maybe the canteen is connected to the sauna via another exit. Or perhaps the user needs to go north from the sauna. But the sauna's north exit is unguarded. Let me check the descriptions again.

In the sauna, the user is told to try going north or west. The basement had an exit to the east (sauna), and the sauna's west exit would take them back to the basement. But the user needs to get to the canteen. Maybe the canteen is in a different part of the map. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go north from the sauna, which might lead to another room, perhaps the canteen.

But the user is in the sauna now. The previous action was going east from the basement to the sauna. Now, from the sauna, the next step should be to go north. But the user might be in a loop if going north leads back to the basement. Wait, the initial basement had an exit to the east (sauna) and west. The sauna's west exit would take them back to the basement. So if the user goes north from the sauna, maybe that's a new direction. But the sauna's description says north is unguarded. So maybe that's the way to go. Let's try that.

So the next step after being in the sauna is to go north. That would take the user to a new room. If that room is the canteen, then they can retrieve the teapot. But if not, maybe they need to explore further. However, the user's goal is to get to the canteen's floor. So the correct path is: basement -> east (sauna) -> north (maybe canteen). But the user is in the sauna now, so the next action should be north. However, the user might have already tried that. Wait, the user's previous action was going east, then the current room is sauna. The next step is to go north. But the user might be in a loop if going north leads back to the basement. But the initial problem says the canteen is in the floor, so maybe the canteen is accessible from the sauna's north exit. Therefore, the next action is to go north.
</think>go north

-= Canteen =-
You've entered a canteen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.



You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a keycard and a teapot on the floor.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to retrieve the teapot from the canteen floor. So far, the assistant has gone east from the basement into the sauna, then north to the canteen. Now, in the canteen, they need to pick up the teapot.

Looking at the current room description, there's a keycard and a teapot on the floor. The previous actions were moving east and north, which led to the canteen. The next logical step is to pick up the teapot. The command should be "take teapot" or something similar. But the user's instruction says to output only the command, nothing else. So the correct action here is to take the teapot. The assistant hasn't done that yet, so the next step is to take it.
