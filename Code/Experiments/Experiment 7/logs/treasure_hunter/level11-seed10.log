It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! First step, make an effort to travel south. If you can get through with that, lift the stick of butter from the floor of the cubicle. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Bedroom =-
You've moved into an usual room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be usual. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the bedroom. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.



There is an open gateway leading south. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east.
