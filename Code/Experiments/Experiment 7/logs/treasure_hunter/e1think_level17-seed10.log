It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. Your first objective is to try to go north. After that, make an effort to venture east. Next, open the portal. After you have opened the portal, take a trip north. And then, assure that the gate is open. After pulling open the gate, go to the east. Okay, and then, lift the stick of butter from the floor of the cubicle. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Basement =-
You've entered a basement. Let's see what's in here.

Hey, want to see a counter? Look over there, a counter. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it.

There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Bedchamber =-
You are in a bedchamber. A normal one.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a TextWorld game and needs to follow a specific sequence of actions to win. The goal is to go north, then east, open the portal, go north again, ensure the gate is open, go east, lift the butter stick, and win.

First, I need to recall the current state. The user started in the basement, went north to the bedchamber. Now, in the bedchamber, there's an exit to the east and south. The next steps according to the original plan are to venture east, open the portal, go north, check the gate, go east again, lift the butter, and win.

But the user is in the bedchamber. The next step after going north from the basement was to go east. Wait, the initial instructions said after going north, venture east. So from the bedchamber, the user can go east. But the bedchamber's description mentions an exit to the east and south. So the next logical step is to go east from the bedchamber. However, the user might be stuck in a loop if they keep going back and forth. But according to the current state, the user hasn't done any of the later steps like opening the portal or lifting the butter yet. So the next action should be to go east from the bedchamber. But wait, the original plan says after going north (from basement), venture east. So from the bedchamber, going east is the next step. Then, after that, open the portal, etc. So the next command should be "go east".

-= Spare Room =-
You arrive in a spare room. A standard kind of place.

You make out a toolbox. The toolbox is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a coffer. Oh, great. Here's a display. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. This always happens!

There is a closed portal leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

There is a passkey on the floor.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing a text adventure game and needs to follow specific steps to win. The goal is to go north, then east, open the portal, go north again, ensure the gate is open, go east, lift the butter stick, and win.

Looking at the current state: The user is in the Spare Room. They found a passkey on the floor. The previous actions were going north from the basement to the Bedchamber, then east to the Spare Room. Now, the next step according to the original plan was to open the portal. But in the Spare Room, there's a closed portal north and a passkey. The passkey might be needed to open the portal. So the next logical step is to pick up the passkey first. Then use it to open the portal. But the user's next action should be to take the passkey. Wait, the original plan said after opening the portal, go north again. But maybe the portal can't be opened without the passkey. So the correct step here is to take the passkey. Then use it to open the portal. But the user's last action was going east, so now they need to pick up the passkey. The command would be "take passkey" or "get passkey". But in the game's context, the correct command might be "take passkey" to pick it up. Then, after that, use it to open the portal. So the next action is to take the passkey.
</think>take passkey
