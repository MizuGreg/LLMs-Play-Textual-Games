Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First thing I need you to do is to make an attempt to go north. And then, make an attempt to take a trip north. And then, make an attempt to travel north. Then, travel east. After that, take a trip south. Then, make an effort to go to the east. With that accomplished, make an attempt to go south. If you can get through with that, venture west. If you can finish that, pick-up the worm from the floor of the kitchenette. Alright, thanks!

-= Sauna =-
You have fallen into the most standard of all possible saunas.

You make out a board. The board is ordinary. However, the board, like an empty board, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Shower =-
You are in a shower. A typical kind of place.

You can see a closed dresser in the room. You can make out a basket. You can see a bench. The bench is ordinary. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a rack. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The rack is typical. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

You are in a basement. An ordinary one. You begin to take stock of what's here.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to proceed. The user's goal is to pick up the worm from the kitchenette floor. So far, the path taken has been moving through various rooms: sauna, shower, basement, bedroom, canteen, back to bedroom, basement again, playroom, and back to basement. The user is now in the basement again, having gone south from the playroom.

Looking at the current room (basement), the workbench is empty. The exits are north and south. The user has already tried going north and south multiple times, which might be causing a loop. The previous actions didn't lead to the worm, so maybe the correct approach is to find another way or check different areas.

Wait, the original instruction mentioned the kitchenette. The user hasn't been to the kitchen yet. Maybe the path requires going east from the basement. The basement has an exit to the east. Let me check the previous steps. When in the basement (step 7), the user went north to the playroom, then south back to basement. But the exit to the east was mentioned as unblocked. So perhaps the next step is to go east from the basement to reach the kitchenette where the worm is located. That would be the next logical move to avoid the loop and progress towards the goal.
