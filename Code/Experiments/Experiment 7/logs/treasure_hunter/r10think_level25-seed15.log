Welcome to TextWorld! First thing I need you to do is to head west. If you can manage that, make an attempt to venture north. Next, attempt to travel west. Following that, try to take a trip south. And then, attempt to go to the west. That done, venture north. Following that, make an effort to take a trip north. If you can finish that, attempt to take a trip north. With that done, make an attempt to go to the east. Then, go to the north. Then, recover the loaf of bread from the floor of the dish-pit. That's it!
