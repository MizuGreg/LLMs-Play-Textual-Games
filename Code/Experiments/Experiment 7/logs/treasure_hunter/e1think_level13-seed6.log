Welcome to another fast paced game of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, you could, like, travel north. And then, attempt to go to the west. With that accomplished, take a trip west. If you can do that, pick up the chocolate bar from the floor of the workshop. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Lounge =-
You've just shown up in a lounge.

You see a bed. The bed appears to be empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the bed.

There is an open portal leading east. There is an open gate leading west. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north.

-= Recreation Zone =-
You've moved into an ordinary room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be ordinary. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the recreation zone.

You can make out a bookshelf. The bookshelf is ordinary. But there isn't a thing on it. You can see a bar. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the bar.

There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and collect a chocolate bar. The goal is to go north, then west, then west again to pick up the chocolate in the workshop.

First, the initial steps: the user started in the Lounge, went north to the Recreation Zone. Now, the current room is the Recreation Zone. The description mentions an exit to the south and a bookshelf. The next step according to the instructions is to go west. But the user is told to try going west from the Recreation Zone. However, the previous action was going north, and now they need to go west from here. Wait, the user's last action was "go north", leading them to the Recreation Zone. The next step in the plan is to go west from there. But the current room's description says there's an exit to the south, but the user needs to go west. Wait, maybe the Recreation Zone has a west exit? Let me check the description again.

Looking at the Recreation Zone description: "There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west." Wait, the text says "You should try going west" even though the exit is to the south. That might be a hint that the user is supposed to go west from here. Maybe the exit to the south is just a distraction. So the next step is to go west from the Recreation Zone. But the user has already gone north once. The plan was to go north, then west, then west again. So after going north to Recreation Zone, the next step is to go west. Then from there, maybe another west to reach the workshop. But the user is in the Recreation Zone now, so the next action should be "go west". But the user's previous action was "go north", so they need to go west now. The user's next command should be "go west".

-= Kitchenette =-
You've just walked into a kitchenette.

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a cabinet. You can make out a saucepan. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and collect a chocolate bar. The goal is to go north, then west, then west again, and pick up the chocolate in the workshop.

First, I need to recall the current state. The user started in the Lounge, went north to the Recreation Zone, then west to the Kitchenette. Now, they're in the Kitchenette, and the next step is to go west again to reach the workshop. But the previous action was "go west" from the Kitchenette, which led to the current room. Wait, the user's last action was "go west" from the Kitchenette, but the prompt says they're in the Kitchenette now. So maybe they need to go east instead? Or perhaps there's a loop here.

Looking at the current room description: the Kitchenette has an exit to the east (unguarded) and west (unguarded). The user needs to get to the workshop. The previous steps were Lounge -> Recreation Zone -> Kitchenette. The next step should be to go west from the Kitchenette to reach the workshop. But maybe the user is stuck in a loop because they've already been there. Wait, the initial instructions said to go north, then west, then west again. So after the Kitchenette, going west would take them to the workshop. But the user might have already done that. Wait, the initial steps were: go north (from Lounge to Recreation Zone), then go west (from Recreation Zone to Kitchenette). Now, from Kitchenette, going west again would be the third step. But the user's last action was "go west" from Kitchenette, which might not have been the correct direction. Wait, the Recreation Zone's west exit leads to the Kitchenette. Then, from Kitchenette, west is the next step. But maybe the user is in a loop because they've already been through those rooms. Alternatively, maybe the correct path is to go east from the Kitchenette to get back to the Recreation Zone and then west again. But that would be redundant. Alternatively, perhaps the user needs to go east from the Kitchenette to reach the exit back to the Recreation Zone, then west again to the workshop. But the initial plan was to go north, then west, then west. So maybe the user is at the third step, needing to go west from the Kitchenette to the workshop. However, the current room is the Kitchenette, and the exit to the west is unguarded. So the next action should be "go west" again. But the user might have already done that. Wait, the user's previous action was "go west" from the Recreation Zone to get to the Kitchenette. Now, from the Kitchenette, going west again would be the next step. But the user's last action was "go west" from the Kitchenette, which might not have been the correct direction. Wait, the user's current room is the Kitchenette. The exits are east and west. The user needs to go west to reach the workshop. So the next action is "go west". But the user might be in a loop if they keep going back and forth. However, according to the initial plan, the third step is to go west again. So the correct next action is "go west".

-= Workshop =-
You are in a workshop. A standard kind of place. You begin looking for stuff.



There is an unguarded exit to the east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

There is a chocolate bar and a broccoli on the floor.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and pick up a chocolate bar to win. Let me break down the current situation.

First, the goal is to travel north, then west, then west again. Once in the workshop, they need to pick up the chocolate bar. The user has already moved from the Lounge to the Recreation Zone, then to the Kitchenette, and now they're in the Workshop. The current room is the Workshop, which has the chocolate bar on the floor.

Looking at the previous steps: they went north from the Lounge, then west to the Recreation Zone, then west again to the Kitchenette, and now west once more to the Workshop. The next step should be to pick up the chocolate bar. But the user's last action was "go west", which led them to the Workshop. Now, in the Workshop, they need to pick up the chocolate bar. The instruction says to pick it up from the floor of the workshop. So the next command should be to take the chocolate bar. But the game might require using the exact phrase, like "take chocolate bar" or "pick up chocolate bar". Since the user has already been told to pick it up, the correct action here is to take it. The user hasn't done that yet, so the next step is to take the chocolate bar. The previous actions have successfully led them to the workshop, so the next command is to pick it up.
