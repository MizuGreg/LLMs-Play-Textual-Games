Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, travel west. And then, attempt to go to the west. With that accomplished, lift the chocolate bar from the floor of the workshop. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

You've moved into an ordinary room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be ordinary. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the recreation zone.

You can make out a bookshelf. The bookshelf is ordinary. But there isn't a thing on it. You can see a bar. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the bar.

There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text-based game where they need to follow specific steps to achieve the goal. The main objective is to travel west, then attempt to go west again, lift the chocolate bar from the workshop floor, and then stop.

First, I need to recall the current state. The user started in the Recreation Zone, went west to the Kitchenette. Now, they're in the Kitchenette, which has an exit to the west and east. The goal is to get to the workshop, lift the chocolate bar, and then stop.

Wait, the initial instructions said to travel west first, then attempt to go west again. But in the current room (Kitchenette), the exit to the west is unguarded. So maybe the next step is to go west again from here. But the user is already in the Kitchenette. Let me check the previous steps.

The user first went west from Recreation Zone to Kitchenette. Now, in Kitchenette, the exit to the west is unguarded. So going west from Kitchenette would take them back to Recreation Zone? Or maybe to another area? Wait, the initial description said that after going west from Recreation Zone, they entered the Kitchenette. So the exit to the west in Kitchenette would be back to Recreation Zone. But the goal is to get to the workshop. Maybe the workshop is another room west of the Kitchenette? Or perhaps the user needs to find the workshop through other means.

Wait, the original goal was to travel west, then attempt to go west again, then lift the chocolate bar from the workshop. So maybe after going west once (to Kitchenette), the next step is to go west again, which might lead to the workshop. But in the current room (Kitchenette), the exit to the west is unguarded. So going west from here would take them back to Recreation Zone? That doesn't make sense. Maybe there's a different path.

Alternatively, perhaps the user needs to go east from Kitchenette to find the workshop. But the initial instruction was to go west first. Hmm. Maybe the user is in a loop between Recreation Zone and Kitchenette. The problem is that the user needs to reach the workshop, which is presumably west of the Kitchenette. But if going west from Kitchenette leads back to Recreation Zone, then maybe the workshop is in another direction. Wait, the initial description mentioned a workshop, but the user hasn't found it yet.

Wait, the user's first action was to go west from Recreation Zone, which led to Kitchenette. The next step according to the goal is to attempt to go west again. So from Kitchenette, going west would be the next step. But if that leads back to Recreation Zone, then maybe the user is stuck in a loop. However, the user needs to lift the chocolate bar from the workshop. So perhaps the workshop is in a different location. Maybe the user needs to go east from Kitchenette to find the workshop? But the initial instruction was to go west first.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east from Kitchenette to find the exit to the east, which might lead to the workshop. But the initial goal was to go west. This is confusing. The user needs to find the workshop, which is mentioned as having a chocolate bar on the floor. The user hasn't found it yet. So maybe the workshop is in the west direction from the Kitchenette. But the exit to the west in Kitchenette is unguarded, leading back to Recreation Zone. So perhaps the user needs to go east from Kitchenette to find the workshop. But the initial instruction was to go west first. 

Wait, maybe the user is in a loop between Recreation Zone and Kitchenette. The user needs to break the loop by trying a different action. Since going west again leads back to the same place, maybe the user should try going east from Kitchenette to find another path. But the initial goal was to go west. However, the user's next step should be to go west again, but if that's not working, they need to find another way. But the user's next action should be to go west again, even if it's the same as before. But the user needs to lift the chocolate bar from the workshop, so maybe the workshop is in a different location. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east from Kitchenette to find the workshop. The exit to the east is unguarded. So going east from Kitchenette would take them to another room. If that's the case, then the next step is to go east. But the initial instruction was to go west first. However, the user is stuck in a loop between Recreation Zone and Kitchenette. So the user needs to try a different action. The user's previous actions were go west (to Kitchenette), then maybe go west again (back to Recreation Zone). But the user needs to reach the workshop. Therefore, the user should try going east from Kitchenette to find the workshop. 

So the next action is to go east.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in TextWorld. The goal is to first travel west, then attempt to go west again, lift the chocolate bar from the workshop floor, and then stop.

Looking at the history, the user started in the Recreation Zone, went west to the Kitchenette, then east back to Recreation Zone. Now they're back in Recreation Zone again. The problem is that the previous actions (going west and east) are leading them in a loop between the two rooms. The chocolate bar is mentioned in the initial description of the Recreation Zone, but it's on the floor of the workshop. Wait, the user hasn't reached the workshop yet. The current location is Recreation Zone, which has a bar but it's empty. The exit to the south is unguarded, and the user is supposed to go west again.

But the user is stuck in a loop between Recreation Zone and Kitchenette. The initial instruction says to travel west first, then attempt to go west again. Maybe the first west takes them to Kitchenette, then another west would take them back to Recreation Zone? Or maybe there's a different path. The user needs to find the workshop where the chocolate bar is. The workshop isn't mentioned in the current rooms, so perhaps the workshop is another room accessible from Recreation Zone. The exit to the south is unguarded, but that's not the workshop. The user needs to find the workshop, lift the chocolate bar, and then stop.

But in the current state, the user is in Recreation Zone again after going east. The next step should be to go west again to try to reach the workshop. However, since the user is looping, maybe they need to find another way. Alternatively, maybe the workshop is accessible from the Kitchenette. But the user hasn't checked that yet. The user needs to go west from Recreation Zone to reach the workshop. But in the current state, the user is in Recreation Zone, so the next action should be to go west again. However, the previous action was going east, which brought them back. So maybe the correct next step is to go west again, even though it's looping, because that's part of the initial instructions. The user has to follow the steps: travel west, then attempt to go west again. So the next action is go west.

Looking at the history, the user started in the Recreation Zone, went west to the Kitchenette, then tried going east and west again. Now they're back in the Kitchenette again. The problem is that the user is stuck in a loop between the Recreation Zone and Kitchenette by going west and east.

The goal is to reach the workshop to lift the chocolate bar. So far, the user hasn't found the workshop yet. The current location is the Kitchenette, which doesn't mention a chocolate bar. The previous actions of going west and east aren't leading to the workshop. 

The next step should be to find a way to get to the workshop. Since the user is in the Kitchenette, maybe there's a different direction to go. The Kitchenette has an exit to the west and east. The user tried east, which took them back to Recreation Zone, and west took them back to Kitchenette. Maybe there's another exit or a different action needed. But the user needs to find the workshop. Maybe the workshop is connected through another path. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to look for objects that can help, like the saucepan or cabinet, but the goal is specifically about the chocolate bar.

Wait, the initial instruction says to lift the chocolate bar from the floor of the workshop. So the user needs to reach the workshop. The current rooms are Recreation Zone and Kitchenette. The user hasn't found the workshop yet. Maybe the workshop is in another direction. But the user is stuck in a loop. The previous actions of going west and east aren't working. Maybe the user needs to try a different direction, but the available exits are only south, west, east. Wait, in the Kitchenette, the exit to the west is unguarded. But when the user went west from Kitchenette, they went back to Recreation Zone. Maybe the workshop is in another part. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to look for a different path. But the user is stuck in a loop, so they need to break it. The previous action was going east, which didn't help. Maybe the user should try a different action, like looking for objects that can help, but the goal is to go to the workshop. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go south from Recreation Zone. The Recreation Zone has an exit to the south. Let me check the previous steps.

In the first step, the user went west from Recreation Zone to Kitchenette. Then from Kitchenette, they went east back to Recreation Zone. Now, in the current step, they are in Kitchenette again. The exit to the west is unguarded. Maybe the user needs to go south from Recreation Zone. But the user is in Kitchenette. Wait, the user is in Kitchenette, and the exit to the west is unguarded. But when they went west from Kitchenette, they went back to Recreation Zone. So maybe the user needs to go south from Recreation Zone. But how to get there? The user is in Kitchenette, so maybe they need to go east again to Recreation Zone, then south. But that's what they did before. Maybe the user needs to find another way. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to look for a different action, like using the saucepan or cabinet, but the goal is to reach the workshop. 

Since the user is stuck in a loop between Kitchenette and Recreation Zone, the next step should be to go south from Recreation Zone. But how to get there? The user is in Kitchenette. So the user needs to go east to Recreation Zone, then south. But the user has already tried that. Wait, the user is in Kitchenette, and the exit to the west is unguarded.

But the user has already done that. So maybe the user needs to try a different action. But the available actions are west, east, and maybe looking around. However, the user needs to go to the workshop. So the correct next step is to go east from Kitchenette to Recreation Zone, then south. But the user is in Kitchenette, so the next action is east. But the user has already done that. So maybe the user needs to try a different action. But the user is stuck in a loop. Therefore, the next action should be to go south from Recreation Zone, but how? The user is in Kitchenette, so they need to go east to Recreation Zone, then south. So the next action is east.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in a text-based game. The goal is to first travel west, then attempt to go west again, lift the chocolate bar from the floor of the workshop, and then stop.

Looking at the history, the user has been moving between the Recreation Zone and the Kitchenette. They started by going west, which took them to the Kitchenette. Then they went east, back to the Recreation Zone. This back-and-forth suggests a loop.

The main challenge is to avoid getting stuck in this loop. The user needs to find a way to progress towards the workshop where the chocolate bar is located. Since the previous actions of going west and east are leading them in circles, maybe they need to try a different direction. The Recreation Zone has an exit to the south, but the user hasn't tried that yet. However, the initial instruction was to go west first. Wait, maybe the user needs to go west again but find a different path. Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to move south from the Recreation Zone. But the user's goal is to reach the workshop, which might be in a different area. 

Wait, the initial instruction says to travel west and then attempt to go west again. But in the current state, the user is in the Recreation Zone again after moving east. So maybe the next step is to go west again, but the system is indicating that the user is in a loop. Therefore, the user needs to try a different action, perhaps using a synonym like "move west" instead of "go west" to break the loop. But the system might not recognize synonyms, so maybe trying a different direction like south. However, the user's goal is to reach the workshop, which might be in a different room. Alternatively, maybe the workshop is in the Kitchenette, but the chocolate bar is mentioned as being on the floor of the workshop. So perhaps the user needs to find the workshop room. 

But in the current state, the user is in the Recreation Zone. The exit to the south is unguarded. Maybe going south is the next step. However, the initial instructions said to go west first. But if going west leads to a loop, then perhaps the user needs to try a different approach. The key is to avoid repeating the same action. So instead of going west again, maybe go south. But the user's goal is to reach the workshop. Alternatively, maybe the workshop is in the Kitchenette, and the chocolate bar is there. But the user hasn't found it yet. 

Wait, the user's task is to lift the chocolate bar from the floor of the workshop. So the user needs to find the workshop room. The current location is the Recreation Zone. The exits are south and west. The user tried west and east, which looped back. So maybe the correct path is to go south from the Recreation Zone. Let's check the previous steps. The user was in the Recreation Zone, then went west to Kitchenette, then east back to Recreation Zone. So maybe the next step is to go south from Recreation Zone. But the user's initial instruction was to go west first. However, since going west leads to a loop, the user needs to try a different direction. So the next action should be to go south. But the user's goal is to reach the workshop. Alternatively, maybe the workshop is in the Kitchenette, and the chocolate bar is there. But the user hasn't found it yet. 

In the Kitchenette, there's a saucepan, but it's empty. The user needs to find the chocolate bar. However, the chocolate bar is in the workshop. So the user needs to reach the workshop. The workshop might be accessible from the Recreation Zone via south. So the next step is to go south. But the user's previous actions were going west and east, which looped. Therefore, the correct next action is to go south to break the loop and proceed towards the workshop.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to travel west, then attempt to go west again, lift the chocolate bar from the floor of the workshop, and then stop. So far, the user has moved through several rooms: Recreation Zone, Kitchenette, Lounge. The last action was going south to the Lounge.

In the Lounge, the exits are east, west, and north. The user needs to continue moving west to reach the workshop where the chocolate bar is. But the previous actions have been going back and forth between rooms, possibly looping. The user needs to find a way to proceed towards the workshop without getting stuck in a loop.

The next step should be to go north from the Lounge, as that's the new exit available. Going north might lead to the workshop. Alternatively, if north doesn't work, maybe east or west. But since the goal is to go west, perhaps north is the correct direction here. The user needs to check the next room to see if the workshop is there. So the next action is to go north.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to travel west, then attempt to go west again, lift the chocolate bar from the floor of the workshop, and then stop. So far, the user has been moving between rooms: starting in the Recreation Zone, going west to the Kitchenette, then east back to Recreation Zone, then north to Lounge, and back south to Recreation Zone again. It seems like they're stuck in a loop between Recreation Zone and Kitchenette.

The main issue is that the user is repeatedly going west and east, which isn't making progress towards the chocolate bar. The chocolate bar is mentioned in the initial instruction, but in the current rooms described, there's no mention of a chocolate bar. The bar in the Recreation Zone is empty, and the Kitchenette has a saucepan but nothing else. The Lounge has a bed, but no chocolate bar.

So, the next step should be to check if the chocolate bar is in the current room or nearby. Since the user is in the Recreation Zone again, maybe the chocolate bar is here. But the description says the bar is empty. Wait, maybe the chocolate bar is on the floor of the workshop. The initial instruction says to lift it from the floor of the workshop. But the user hasn't found the workshop yet. 

Wait, the user's path has taken them through Recreation Zone, Kitchenette, Lounge, and back. The workshop isn't mentioned in any of these rooms. So perhaps the workshop is another room that hasn't been explored yet. The user needs to find the workshop, go to the west (as per the initial instruction), then lift the chocolate bar.

But in the current state, the user is in the Recreation Zone again. The exit to the south is unguarded. Maybe the workshop is south of the Recreation Zone. The user tried going south once before, but maybe they need to go south from the Lounge. Wait, in the Lounge, the exit to the north is there, but the user was told to try going north from the Lounge, which led back to Recreation Zone. 

Alternatively, maybe the workshop is in a different direction. The user needs to find the workshop, go west from there, and lift the chocolate bar. But since the user is stuck in a loop, they need to find a different path. Maybe the exit to the south from the Lounge is the way to go. Let me check the previous steps.

In the Lounge, the user was told to try going north, which led back to Recreation Zone. But the Lounge has an exit to the south. Wait, no, in the Lounge description, it says there's an open portal east, open gate west, and you should try going north. So the exits from Lounge are east, west, and north. The user went north, which took them back to Recreation Zone. Maybe the workshop is in the south from the Lounge? But the Recreation Zone is where they are now. 

Alternatively, maybe the workshop is in the Kitchenette. But the Kitchenette's description doesn't mention a chocolate bar. The user needs to find the workshop, which might be a different room. Since the user is stuck in a loop, they need to try a different action. The previous actions were going west and east, which didn't help. Maybe the next step is to go south from the Lounge, but the Lounge's description doesn't mention a south exit. Wait, in the Lounge, the user is told to try going north, but maybe there's another way. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west from the Lounge. The Lounge has an open gate leading west. So from Lounge, go west to Kitchenette again. But that's where they were before. Maybe the workshop is in the Kitchenette? But the Kitchenette's description doesn't mention it. 

This is confusing. The user's goal is to lift the chocolate bar from the workshop's floor. The workshop hasn't been found yet. The initial instruction says to travel west, then attempt to go west again. Maybe the workshop is west of the current location. But the user is in Recreation Zone, which has an exit to the west. So going west from Recreation Zone would take them to another room. But the previous steps showed that going west from Recreation Zone leads to Kitchenette, then east back. 

Wait, maybe the workshop is in the Kitchenette. The user needs to check if there's a chocolate bar there. But the Kitchenette's description says the saucepan is empty. Maybe the chocolate bar is on the floor of the workshop, which is a different room. The user hasn't found it yet. 

Since the user is stuck in a loop, the next action should be to try a different direction. The previous actions were going west and east, which didn't help. Maybe the user needs to go south from the Lounge. But the Lounge's description doesn't mention a south exit. Wait, in the Lounge, the user is told to try going north, but maybe there's another way. 

Alternatively, the user needs to find the workshop by exploring other exits. Since the user is in the Recreation Zone, maybe the exit to the south is the way to go. The Recreation Zone has an exit to the south, which is unguarded. So going south from Recreation Zone might lead to the workshop. Let me check the previous steps. 

In the Recreation Zone, the user was told to try going west. But if they go south, maybe that's the path to the workshop. The initial instruction says to travel west first, then attempt to go west again. Maybe the workshop is west of the Recreation Zone. But the user has already tried going west and ended up in the Kitchenette. 

This is getting complicated. The user needs to find the workshop, which is probably in a different room. Since the user is stuck in a loop, the next action should be to go south from the Recreation Zone. That's the exit mentioned there. So the next command would be "go south".

Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is in a text-based game where they need to follow specific steps to achieve the goal. The goal is to travel west, then attempt to go west again, lift the chocolate bar from the floor of the workshop, and then stop.

Looking at the history of commands given, the user has been moving between different rooms: Recreation Zone, Kitchenette, Lounge, and back to Recreation Zone. The main challenge seems to be getting stuck in a loop between these areas. The user has tried going west, east, south, and north, but it's like they're cycling through the same rooms without making progress towards the chocolate bar.

The current room is the Lounge, with an open portal east and a gate west. The previous action was going north, which led back to the Recreation Zone. Now, the user is again in the Recreation Zone, and the same options are available. The problem is that the chocolate bar is mentioned as being in the workshop, but the user hasn't found it yet. However, the current rooms don't mention a workshop. Maybe the workshop is a different location that hasn't been explored yet.

Wait, the initial instruction said to travel west first. The user started by going west from the Recreation Zone into the Kitchenette. Then they tried east, leading back to the Lounge, then north to Recreation Zone again. It seems like the user is stuck in a loop between Recreation Zone and Lounge. The chocolate bar is in the workshop, but the user hasn't reached it yet. Maybe the workshop is accessible through another path that hasn't been explored.

But in the current state, the user is in the Recreation Zone again. The exit to the south is unguarded. Maybe the user needs to go south from here. But previously, going south from Recreation Zone led to the Lounge. However, the user is now in the Lounge again. Maybe the workshop is in a different direction. Alternatively, perhaps the user needs to find a way to get to the workshop through the existing paths.

Wait, the initial goal was to travel west, then attempt to go west again. Maybe the user needs to go west from the Lounge. But the Lounge has a portal east and a gate west. Going west from the Lounge would lead back to the Recreation Zone. But the user has already been there. Maybe the workshop is in the Kitchenette? But the Kitchenette's description doesn't mention a chocolate bar. The bar there is empty. The Recreation Zone's bar is also empty. The Lounge's bed is empty. So where is the chocolate bar?

Wait, the user's goal is to lift the chocolate bar from the floor of the workshop. So the workshop must be a room that hasn't been explored yet. The user has been moving between Recreation Zone, Kitchenette, and Lounge. Maybe the workshop is in one of these rooms, but the description doesn't mention it. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to find a way to get to the workshop through the existing exits.

Alternatively, perhaps the user is supposed to go west from the Lounge, but that leads back to Recreation Zone. Then, from there, go south to Lounge again. It's a loop. The user needs to break this loop. The previous actions of going north and south are causing the loop. Maybe the user needs to try a different direction, like east from the Lounge. The portal east is unguarded. Going east from the Lounge might lead to a new room that has the workshop.

So the next step would be to go east from the Lounge, which is the current room. That's the next action. The user has been going back and forth between Recreation Zone and Lounge, but going east from the Lounge might lead to a new area where the workshop is located. Therefore, the next command should be "go east".

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to travel west, then attempt to go west again, lift the chocolate bar from the floor of the workshop, and then stop. So far, the user has been moving between different rooms: Recreation Zone, Kitchenette, Lounge, and now Cookhouse. The previous actions were going south, east, north, etc., but they keep looping between rooms.

Looking at the current room, Cookhouse, there's a portal west and options to go north or south. The user needs to find the workshop where the chocolate bar is. Since the initial instruction was to travel west first, maybe the workshop is to the west of the Cookhouse. But the user just came from the Lounge, which had a portal east and gate west. Wait, the user is in Cookhouse now, and the previous steps might have looped between rooms without finding the chocolate bar.

The key is to lift the chocolate bar from the workshop's floor. The user hasn't found the workshop yet. So the next step is to check if the Cookhouse has an exit leading to the workshop. The prompt says there's an open portal west, so maybe going west from Cookhouse leads to the workshop. Let me check the previous steps. The user went east from Lounge to Cookhouse. So from Cookhouse, going west would take them back to Lounge? Or maybe to the workshop? The user needs to find the workshop. Since the initial instruction was to travel west, perhaps the workshop is in the west direction. But the user is currently in Cookhouse, so the next action should be to go west to check if that's the workshop. If that's the case, then the user can lift the chocolate bar there. But the user hasn't found the chocolate bar yet, so the next step is to go west from Cookhouse.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they need to follow specific steps to win. The goal is to first travel west, then attempt to go west again, lift the chocolate bar from the floor of the workshop, and then stop.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Lounge again after moving west from the Cookhouse. The previous actions have been moving between different rooms like Recreation Zone, Kitchenette, Lounge, Cookhouse, and back to Lounge. It seems like there's a loop between the Lounge and Cookhouse, with the user repeatedly going west and east.

The user's past actions include going west, east, south, north, etc., but they haven't found the workshop yet. The chocolate bar is mentioned as being in the workshop, so the next step should be to find the workshop and lift the chocolate bar.

However, the current room is the Lounge, which doesn't mention a workshop. The exits here are east and west, leading to other rooms. The user needs to break the loop and find the correct path to the workshop. Since the previous actions haven't led to the workshop, maybe the user needs to try a different direction, like north, even though the Lounge says to try going north. Alternatively, maybe there's a different way to navigate from the Cookhouse.

Wait, in the Cookhouse, the exits were west and north/south. The user went west to Lounge, then east back to Cookhouse, and so on. Maybe the workshop is in a different direction. But the initial instruction was to travel west first, then attempt to go west again. Maybe the user needs to go west from the Lounge, but that leads back to the Cookhouse. Alternatively, maybe the workshop is in the south from the Lounge, but the Lounge's exit is north. Hmm.

Wait, the initial goal was to travel west, then go west again, then lift the chocolate bar from the workshop. The user has been moving west and east, but hasn't reached the workshop. The workshop might be in a different room. Maybe the user needs to go south from the Lounge, but the Lounge's description says to try going north. But the user is in the Lounge, and the exits are east, west, and north. The previous attempts to go south didn't work because the Lounge doesn't have a south exit. Wait, in the Cookhouse, there was a south exit. Maybe the user needs to go south from the Cookhouse.

But the user is currently in the Lounge. The previous move was from Cookhouse to Lounge. So, from Lounge, the exits are east, west, and north. The user needs to find the workshop. Since the workshop is mentioned in the initial description, maybe the user needs to go north from the Lounge. Let me check the Lounge's description again. The Lounge says: "You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north." So the next step should be to go north from the Lounge. That would take the user to the next room, possibly the workshop. Then, once there, they can lift the chocolate bar. So the next action should be go north.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to travel west, then attempt to go west again, lift the chocolate bar from the floor of the workshop, and then stop. But the current environment seems to be looping between the Recreation Zone and Lounge, with the user repeatedly moving east and west.

First, I need to check if the chocolate bar is in the current room. The user is in the Recreation Zone, which has a bar, but it's empty. The workshop isn't mentioned here. Maybe the chocolate bar is in a different room, like the Cookhouse or Lounge. But the user hasn't found it yet.

Looking at the previous steps, the user has been moving between rooms but hasn't found the chocolate bar. The main issue is that the user is stuck in a loop between Recreation Zone and Lounge. The instructions mention that after traveling west, they need to lift the chocolate bar. However, the current rooms don't have the chocolate bar mentioned.

Wait, the initial instruction says "lift the chocolate bar from the floor of the workshop." So the workshop must be a room where the chocolate is. But the user hasn't entered the workshop yet. The current rooms are Recreation Zone, Lounge, Cookhouse, etc. Maybe the workshop is another room that's not been visited yet.

But the user's actions so far have been moving east and west, not north or south. The Lounge has a north exit, but the user hasn't tried going north. In the Cookhouse, there's a north and south exit. Maybe the workshop is in one of these directions. However, the user hasn't explored those paths yet.

Alternatively, maybe the chocolate bar is in the Recreation Zone's bar, but it's empty. The user needs to find it. But the problem is that the user is stuck in a loop, moving between rooms without progress. The key is to break the loop by trying a different direction. The previous actions were going east and west, so maybe trying north or south next.

In the Lounge, the user can go north. In the Cookhouse, there's a north and south exit. The user needs to find the workshop. Since the goal is to lift the chocolate bar from the workshop, the user must reach that room. The current loop suggests that the user is not moving towards the workshop. Therefore, the next step should be to go north from the Cookhouse to find the workshop, which might have the chocolate bar.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to travel west, then attempt to go west again, lift the chocolate bar from the floor of the workshop, and then stop. So far, the user has been moving between different rooms like the Recreation Zone, Kitchenette, Lounge, and Cookhouse. They've tried going west, east, north, south, but ended up in a loop between Recreation Zone and Lounge.

The current problem is that when the user tried to go north from Recreation Zone, it wasn't possible. So the next step is to figure out alternative directions. The Recreation Zone has an exit to the south, which is unguarded. The Lounge has exits east and west, and a suggestion to go north. But since going north from Recreation Zone is blocked, maybe the user needs to find another way to reach the workshop where the chocolate bar is.

Wait, the original goal was to go west first, then attempt to go west again. Maybe the user needs to find the workshop area. But in the current setup, the user is stuck in a loop between Recreation Zone and Lounge. The chocolate bar is in the workshop, which hasn't been visited yet. So perhaps the user needs to find a path to the workshop through the existing exits.

Looking at the previous moves: the user went west from Recreation Zone to Kitchenette, then east to Lounge, then north to Cookhouse, then west back to Lounge, then north again which was blocked. So maybe the workshop is in a different direction. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go south from Recreation Zone to exit, but that's unguarded. Wait, the exit to the south is unguarded, so maybe that's a way out, but how does that help with the chocolate bar?

Wait, the initial instruction said to travel west first, then attempt to go west again. Maybe the user needs to go west from the current position. But in the Recreation Zone, the exit is to the south. The user is in Recreation Zone, and the previous action was trying to go north which isn't possible. So the only available exit is south. But that's unguarded. However, the goal is to reach the workshop. Maybe the workshop is in the south direction? But the user hasn't found it yet.

Alternatively, maybe the user is stuck in a loop between Recreation Zone and Lounge, and needs to find another way. Since going north from Recreation Zone is blocked, maybe the user should try going west again from Lounge. Wait, in the Lounge, there's an open gate leading west. So from Lounge, going west would take them back to Recreation Zone. But that's the loop. So perhaps the user needs to find another path.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east from Lounge to Cookhouse, then west to Lounge again. But that's the same loop. The problem is that the workshop hasn't been found yet. The chocolate bar is in the workshop, but the user hasn't reached it. So maybe the user needs to find a different path. But all the exits seem to loop between these rooms.

Wait, the initial instruction said to travel west first. The user started by going west from Recreation Zone to Kitchenette. Then east to Lounge, then north to Cookhouse, then west back to Lounge, then north again which was blocked. So maybe the user needs to go south from Recreation Zone to exit, but that's unguarded. However, the exit to the south is unguarded, so maybe that's a way to leave the area. But the chocolate bar is in the workshop, which is presumably in another part of the map.

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go west from the Lounge. But the Lounge has an open gate leading west, which takes them back to Recreation Zone. So that's the loop. The user needs to find a way to reach the workshop. Maybe the workshop is in the Cookhouse? But the Cookhouse has a chair and exits west and north. Wait, the Cookhouse has an open portal west and suggests going north or south. Maybe the workshop is in the north direction from Cookhouse. But the user tried going north from Recreation Zone and couldn't. So perhaps the user needs to go north from Cookhouse.

But the user is currently in Recreation Zone, and the only exit is south. So maybe the user needs to go south, exit, and then find another path. But the exit to the south is unguarded. However, the user's goal is to reach the workshop. Maybe the workshop is outside the current area, and the exit to the south is the way to go. But the user hasn't found the chocolate bar yet.

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go west from the Lounge, but that's the loop. The user needs to find a way to reach the workshop without looping. Since the user is stuck in a loop, the next step is to try a different direction. But the only available directions are west and east from Lounge. Since going north from Recreation Zone is blocked, maybe the user should try going east from Lounge to Cookhouse again, then north from Cookhouse. But that's what the user did before, leading back to the loop.

Wait, the user's goal is to lift the chocolate bar from the floor of the workshop. So the user needs to find the workshop. The workshop might be in the Cookhouse or another area. But the user hasn't found it yet. The current position is Recreation Zone, and the only exit is south. Maybe the user should go south, exit, and then look for the workshop. But the exit to the south is unguarded, so that's possible. However, the user hasn't found the chocolate bar yet. So maybe the user needs to go south, exit, and then proceed to find the workshop.

But the user's previous actions have not led them to the workshop. So the next step is to go south from Recreation Zone, exit, and then proceed. However, the user is in Recreation Zone, and the exit to the south is unguarded. So the command would be "go south".

So far, the user has been moving between different rooms: Recreation Zone, Kitchenette, Lounge, Cookhouse, and back to Lounge. The main challenge is getting to the workshop where the chocolate bar is.

Looking at the current position in the Lounge, the exits are east, west, and north. The user tried going north earlier but couldn't. Now, they're in the Lounge again. The previous actions have been going back and forth between rooms, which suggests a loop. The user needs to find a way to reach the workshop without getting stuck in a cycle.

The key is to find the correct path to the workshop. Since the initial instruction was to go west, maybe the workshop is west of the current location. But in the Lounge, the west exit leads back to the Recreation Zone, which hasn't been productive yet. The user might need to go east from the Lounge to the Cookhouse and then find another path. Alternatively, maybe the workshop is accessible from the Cookhouse.

Wait, in the Cookhouse, there's an open portal west and exits north and south. Maybe going south from the Cookhouse leads to the workshop. But the user hasn't tried that yet. The previous attempt to go north from the Lounge was blocked, so maybe the correct path is east from the Lounge to the Cookhouse, then south to reach the workshop. Once there, the chocolate bar can be lifted. The user needs to avoid looping by choosing different directions when possible.

Looking at the current position in the Cookhouse, the exits are north and south. The user needs to get to the workshop, which is likely in a different area. Since the previous attempts to go north from the Lounge didn't work, maybe trying south from the Cookhouse could lead to a different path. The user has been looping between rooms, so changing direction might help. The next step should be to go south from the Cookhouse to explore another area, possibly leading closer to the workshop.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to travel west, then attempt to go west again, lift the chocolate bar from the floor of the workshop, and then stop. So far, the player has been moving between different rooms: Recreation Zone, Kitchenette, Lounge, Cookhouse, and now Study. The main challenge is to find the chocolate bar in the workshop and lift it.

Looking at the current room, the Study, there's a stand but nothing on it. The only exit mentioned is north. The previous actions have been moving east and west, but the player is now in the Study. The key is to find the workshop where the chocolate bar is. Since the player has been moving around, maybe they need to find a different path. The Study's description mentions a stand, but no chocolate bar. The exit is north, so maybe going north from here could lead to the workshop. Alternatively, maybe there's a hidden path or a different direction. But according to the current room description, the only exit is north. So the next step should be to go north to check if that leads to the workshop. The player needs to continue exploring until they find the chocolate bar and lift it. Since the previous actions have been moving around, the next logical step is to go north from the Study.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in a text-based game. The goal is to travel west, then attempt to go west again, lift the chocolate bar from the floor of the workshop, and then stop.

Looking at the history, the user has been moving between rooms like Recreation Zone, Kitchenette, Lounge, Cookhouse, and Study. The main challenge seems to be moving west and finding the chocolate bar. 

In the current state, the user is in the Cookhouse, and the previous action was going north, which led back to the Cookhouse. The user needs to find a way to proceed without looping. The instruction says to break the loop by using a different action if needed. 

The Cookhouse has an open portal leading west and options to go north or south. Since going north led back to the same place, maybe trying south again could be the next step. But the user has already tried going south before. Alternatively, maybe there's a different way to navigate. 

Wait, the goal is to reach the workshop and lift the chocolate bar. The initial steps mentioned traveling west, then attempting to go west again. The user might be stuck in a loop between rooms, so changing direction could help. The Study room had a stand, but nothing on it. The Lounge had a bed, but it's empty. 

Perhaps the correct path is to go west from the Cookhouse, but the user needs to check if that's possible. The current room (Cookhouse) has an open portal west. So going west from here might be the next step. But the user previously went west from the Cookhouse and ended up in the Lounge. Maybe the correct path is to go west again from the Cookhouse, but the user needs to ensure they're not looping. 

Alternatively, since the user is in the Cookhouse and the previous action was going north, maybe trying south again could lead to a new area. However, the user has already tried that. The key is to find the workshop where the chocolate bar is. The initial instruction says to travel west, then attempt to go west again. Maybe the workshop is in a different direction. 

The user needs to break the loop by trying a different action. Since going north and south in the Cookhouse leads back, maybe the correct action is to go west again, even though it's been tried before. But the game might have a loop, so the user needs to find another way. 

Alternatively, maybe the user should look for the chocolate bar in the current room. The Study room had a stand, but nothing on it. The Cookhouse has a chair, but it's empty. The Lounge has a bed. The Recreation Zone has a bar. Maybe the chocolate bar is in the Workshop, which the user hasn't reached yet. 

The user needs to continue moving west until they reach the workshop. The initial steps were to go west, then attempt to go west again. So perhaps the correct path is to keep going west from the Cookhouse. The user's last action was going north, which led back to Cookhouse. So the next step should be to go west again. 

But the user is in the Cookhouse, and the previous action was going north. The current room has an open portal west. So the next action should be go west. However, the user might be in a loop between rooms. But according to the game's structure, the correct path is to keep moving west until the workshop is reached. So the next action is go west.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to travel west, then attempt to go west again, lift the chocolate bar from the floor of the workshop, and then stop. So far, the user has been moving between different rooms like the Recreation Zone, Kitchenette, Lounge, Cookhouse, and Study. They've tried going north, south, east, west repeatedly, but they're stuck in a loop between the Lounge and Cookhouse.

Looking at the current position, the user is in the Lounge again. The previous action was going west, which led back to the Lounge. The problem is that the user is cycling between rooms without making progress towards the workshop where the chocolate bar is. The key is to find a way to get to the workshop without getting stuck in loops.

The instruction mentions that after traveling west and attempting to go west again, the next step is to lift the chocolate bar. But the user hasn't found the workshop yet. So, the next step should be to find the workshop. However, the current rooms don't mention a workshop. Maybe the workshop is in a different direction, or perhaps the chocolate bar is in a room that's been missed.

Wait, the initial description mentioned the Recreation Zone has a bar, but it's empty. The user has been moving around but hasn't found the workshop. Maybe the workshop is in the Study or Cookhouse? The Study has a stand, but nothing on it. The Cookhouse has a chair. Maybe the workshop is in a different room that's not been explored yet.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to find the correct path to the workshop. Since the user is in the Lounge, the possible exits are east, west, north. The previous attempts to go north led back to the Cookhouse, which then led back to the Lounge. Maybe trying a different direction from the Lounge, like east, could lead to a new area. But the user tried east and went to the Cookhouse again.

Wait, the user's past actions include going west, east, north, south multiple times. The challenge is to avoid the loop. The user needs to find a way to reach the workshop where the chocolate bar is. Since the initial instruction says to lift the chocolate bar from the workshop's floor, the user must be in the workshop room.

But in the current state, the user is in the Lounge. The only way to get to the workshop is probably through the Study or Cookhouse. However, the Study's north exit leads back to the Cookhouse. Maybe the workshop is in the Study? But the Study's description doesn't mention a workshop. Alternatively, maybe the workshop is in the Cookhouse. But the Cookhouse has a chair and a portal west.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to find a different path. Since the user is in the Lounge, perhaps the correct direction is north, but that led to the Cookhouse. Maybe the user needs to go east from the Lounge to the Cookhouse, then find another exit. But the Cookhouse has a portal west and exits north and south. Maybe going south from the Cookhouse leads to the Study, then north again?

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go west from the Lounge to the Study, but the Study's north exit is unguarded. Wait, the Study's description says to try going north. But the user is in the Study now, and going north leads back to the Cookhouse. This seems like a loop.

The user needs to break the loop. Since the previous actions of going north and south aren't working, maybe trying a different direction. But the Lounge only has east, west, north. The user has tried all of them. The problem is that the user hasn't found the workshop yet. Maybe the workshop is in the Study, but the Study's description doesn't mention it. Alternatively, maybe the workshop is in the Cookhouse, but the Cookhouse's description doesn't mention it either.

Wait, the initial problem statement says that the user needs to lift the chocolate bar from the floor of the workshop. So the workshop must be a room that the user hasn't explored yet. The user has been moving between rooms but hasn't found it. The key is to find the workshop room. Since the user is in the Lounge, maybe the correct path is to go east to the Cookhouse, then north or south to find the workshop. But the Cookhouse's description doesn't mention a workshop. Alternatively, maybe the workshop is in the Study, but the Study's description doesn't mention it.

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go west from the Lounge to the Study, then north to the Cookhouse, then west to the Lounge again. This is a loop. The user needs to find a way out of this loop. Since the user is stuck, maybe the next action should be to go east from the Lounge to the Cookhouse, then try a different direction. But the Cookhouse has a portal west and exits north and south. Maybe going south from the Cookhouse to the Study, then north again to the Cookhouse. This isn't helping.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west from the Lounge to the Study, then north to the Cookhouse, then west to the Lounge again. This is the same loop. The user is stuck in a cycle between Lounge, Cookhouse, and Study. The only way out is to find a different path, but all exits seem to lead back. The user needs to find the workshop, but it's not in any of these rooms. Maybe the workshop is in the Study, but the Study's description doesn't mention it. Alternatively, maybe the workshop is in the Cookhouse, but the Cookhouse's description doesn't mention it either.

Wait, the initial problem statement says that the user needs to lift the chocolate bar from the floor of the workshop. The user hasn't found the workshop yet. The user is in the Lounge, and the only way to get to the workshop is through the Study or Cookhouse. But the Study and Cookhouse don't mention a workshop. Maybe the workshop is in the Study, and the user needs to look for it. The Study has a stand, but nothing on it. The user needs to check if there's a chocolate bar there. But the user hasn't checked yet.

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go west from the Lounge to the Study, then check the stand for the chocolate bar. But the Study's description says the stand is empty. The user needs to find the chocolate bar in the workshop. Since the user is stuck in a loop, the next action should be to go west from the Lounge to the Study, then check the stand. But the Study's description doesn't mention the chocolate bar. So maybe the workshop is in the Study, and the user needs to look for it.

But the user hasn't found the workshop yet. The user's goal is to lift the chocolate bar from the workshop's floor. So the user must be in the workshop room. The user is in the Lounge, so the next step is to find the workshop. Since the user is stuck in a loop, the next action should be to go west from the Lounge to the Study, then check the stand. If that doesn't work, maybe go north from the Study to the Cookhouse, then west to the Lounge again. But this is the same loop.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east from the Lounge to the Cookhouse, then north to the Study, then west to the Lounge again. This is the same loop. The user is stuck. The only way out is to find the workshop, but it's not in any of these rooms. Maybe the user needs to try a different approach, like looking for the chocolate bar in the current room. But the Lounge has a bed, not a chocolate bar. The Study has a stand, but nothing on it. The Cookhouse has a chair. The user hasn't found the chocolate bar yet.

Wait, the initial problem statement says that the user needs to lift the chocolate bar from the floor of the workshop. The user hasn't found the workshop yet.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to travel west, then attempt to go west again, lift the chocolate bar from the floor of the workshop, and then stop. So far, the user has been moving between different rooms: Recreation Zone, Kitchenette, Lounge, Cookhouse, Study, and now Sauna. The current room is the Sauna, with exits east, south, and west.

Looking at the previous steps, the user has been moving west and east repeatedly, which suggests they might be in a loop. The instruction says to recognize loops and use a different action if needed. The main goal is to reach the workshop and lift the chocolate bar. However, the current room is the Sauna, which doesn't mention a chocolate bar. 

The user needs to find the workshop. Since the Sauna has an exit to the west, maybe that leads to the workshop. But the user has already been going west and east, so maybe they need to find a different path. The Study room was mentioned earlier, but the user hasn't been there in a while. Alternatively, the exit to the south in the Sauna might lead to another area. 

But the main task is to lift the chocolate bar. Since the user hasn't found it yet, they need to navigate to the workshop. The previous steps have been moving between rooms without success. The user might need to try a different direction, like south from the Sauna, even though the instruction says to avoid repeating actions.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to travel west, then attempt to go west again, lift the chocolate bar from the floor of the workshop, and then stop. So far, the user has been moving between different rooms: Recreation Zone, Kitchenette, Lounge, Cookhouse, Study, Sauna, and Closet. The chocolate bar is mentioned in the initial description of the Recreation Zone, but the user hasn't found it yet.

Looking at the current location, the Closet has a chest that's empty. The exit is to the north. The user needs to find the chocolate bar. Since the previous actions have been moving around, maybe the chocolate bar is in a room that's been visited before. The Recreation Zone had a bar, but it's empty. The Workshop isn't mentioned in the current rooms, so perhaps the user needs to find the correct room where the chocolate bar is located.

Wait, the initial instruction says "lift the chocolate bar from the floor of the workshop." So the workshop must be a room that hasn't been explored yet. The user has been moving through other rooms but hasn't reached the workshop. The current room is the Closet, with an exit to the north. Maybe going north from the Closet leads to the workshop. Let me check the previous steps. The user was in the Sauna, then went south to the Closet. The Closet's north exit would take them back to the Sauna? Or maybe another room. Wait, the Sauna's description mentioned an exit to the west and south. The Closet's north exit is unguarded. So perhaps the workshop is connected through another path. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to find the workshop by exploring other exits.

But the user's goal is to lift the chocolate bar from the workshop. Since the user hasn't found the workshop yet, the next step is to find it.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go back to the Lounge or another room and find a different exit.

Alternatively, maybe the chocolate bar is in the Closet's chest, but the chest is empty. The user needs to find the workshop. Since the user has been moving in a loop between rooms, perhaps the next step is to go north from the Closet to find the workshop. But the user needs to make sure they're not repeating actions.

So far, the player has been moving between different rooms like the Recreation Zone, Kitchenette, Lounge, Cookhouse, Study, Sauna, and Closet. They've tried going in various directions, sometimes getting stuck in loops.

Looking at the current position, the user is in the Sauna room. The previous action was going north, which led them back to the Sauna. Now, they need to find a way to proceed towards the workshop where the chocolate bar is. The challenge is to avoid loops and find the correct path.

The key steps remaining are to reach the workshop and lift the chocolate bar. The player has been moving west and east, but maybe they need to find a different route. The Sauna has an exit to the west, so going west from here might lead them closer to the workshop. Alternatively, maybe there's a different direction they haven't explored yet.

Since the previous actions have led them in circles, the next step should be to try a different direction. The Sauna has an exit to the west, so going west could be the next move. That might take them to the Closet again, but perhaps from there, they can find another path. Alternatively, maybe the workshop is accessible from another room they've passed through.

The main thing is to avoid repeating the same actions that lead to loops. The player needs to systematically explore each room, check for the chocolate bar, and find the correct path. Since the chocolate bar is in the workshop, the player must navigate to that specific location. The next logical step is to go west from the Sauna, as that's the unblocked exit mentioned.

In the Basement, the display is mentioned, but it's empty. The exit to the east is unguarded. The user needs to find the workshop. Maybe the workshop is in a different part of the map. Since the user has been moving west and east, perhaps they need to go north from the Basement to find the workshop. The previous action was going west, but the current room's hint says to go north. So the next step should be to go north to explore further and find the workshop where the chocolate bar is. That makes sense because the user hasn't reached the workshop yet, and the workshop is likely in a different area. So the next action should be go north.

THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to travel west, then attempt to go west again, lift the chocolate bar from the floor of the workshop, and then stop. 

Looking at the current scene, the user is in the Workshop. The description mentions a chocolate bar and broccoli on the floor. The exits are east and south. The previous actions have been moving around different rooms, but the user hasn't picked up the chocolate bar yet.

The next step should be to pick up the chocolate bar. The instruction says to lift it from the floor. So the correct command here is "take chocolate bar" or "pick up chocolate bar". Since the game might expect a specific verb, "take" is more likely. The user needs to perform this action to complete the goal. The previous actions were moving around, so now the focus should be on interacting with the chocolate bar. The answer should be concise, just the command without any extra text.
