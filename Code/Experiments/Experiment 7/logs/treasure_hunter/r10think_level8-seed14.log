Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to make an effort to take a trip west. That done, try to move south. And then, make an effort to take a trip west. With that done, recover the nest of bugs from the floor of the office. Got that? Good!

-= Chamber =-
Well, here we are in the chamber.



You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.
