You are now playing a exciting game of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First, it would be great if you could go west. After that, attempt to head north. And then, lift the banana from the floor of the workshop. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Canteen =-
You find yourself in a canteen. A normal kind of place. You start to take note of what's in the room.



There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.
