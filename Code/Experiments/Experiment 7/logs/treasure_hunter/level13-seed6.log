Welcome to another fast paced game of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, you could, like, travel north. And then, attempt to go to the west. With that accomplished, take a trip west. If you can do that, pick up the chocolate bar from the floor of the workshop. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Lounge =-
You've just shown up in a lounge.

You see a bed. The bed appears to be empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the bed.

There is an open portal leading east. There is an open gate leading west. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north.

-= Recreation Zone =-
You've moved into an ordinary room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be ordinary. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the recreation zone.

You can make out a bookshelf. The bookshelf is ordinary. But there isn't a thing on it. You can see a bar. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the bar.

There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

-= Kitchenette =-
You've just walked into a kitchenette.

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a cabinet. You can make out a saucepan. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.
