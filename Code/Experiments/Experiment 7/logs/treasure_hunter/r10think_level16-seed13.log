Welcome to TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First, it would be a great idea if you could attempt to head south. With that done, make an effort to take a trip west. Then, travel south. With that over with, make an effort to venture east. And then, move east. Then, pick-up the passkey from the floor of the bar. That's it!

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they need to follow specific steps to reach the goal. The goal is to pick up the passkey from the floor of the bar. Let me recap the steps they need to take.

First, they should go south from the cookhouse. Then west, then south again, then east, then east again. After that, they need to go to the bar and pick up the passkey. 

Looking at the current state, the user is back in the Chamber after going west from the Laundromat. They've already done the initial steps: south, west, south, east, and then west again, which brought them back to the Chamber. So they're in a loop here. 

The problem is that they're stuck in the Chamber, which they've already been to. The next step should be to try a different direction instead of going west again. The previous action was going west, which led back to the Chamber. So maybe instead of west, they should try north or east again. But the Chamber has exits to north, east, south. The user needs to find a way to proceed without looping.

Wait, the original plan was after going east from the Chamber, they would go to the Laundromat, then west back to Chamber, but that's not helping. Maybe they need to go north from the Chamber. Let me check the Chamber's description again. The Chamber has an exit to the north, which is unblocked. So maybe going north from the Chamber would take them to another area. But the user's previous steps might have already been through that path. Alternatively, maybe they need to go east again from the Chamber. 

But the user is in the Chamber again, so the next step should be to try a different direction. Since going west led back, perhaps going north or east. The user's next action should be to go north from the Chamber. That way, they can proceed further without looping. So the correct next command is "go north".

Okay, let's break this down. The user is stuck in a loop between the Scullery and Attic. The goal is to pick up the passkey from the bar. So far, they've been moving between these areas without making progress. The key is to find a way to get to the bar.

Looking at the previous steps, the user has been going back and forth between Scullery and Attic. The next step should be to find another exit that leads towards the bar. In the Scullery, the description mentions an unguarded exit to the east. Maybe that's the way to go. Alternatively, the Studio has a locked toolbox and a closed bureau, but the user hasn't checked those yet. However, the original plan was to go east from the Chamber, then east again, then to the bar. But the user is stuck in a loop, so they need to try a different direction. The correct next action is to go east from the Scullery.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Scullery, Studio, and Attic. The goal is to get the passkey from the bar. They've been moving back and forth without making progress. The key is to find a way out of this loop and reach the bar.

First, the goal steps are: go south from cookhouse, west, south, east, east, then get the passkey. But they're not reaching the bar yet. The current position is the Attic, so they need to find another exit. The Attic has an east exit, which was previously tried but maybe hasn't been explored properly. Alternatively, maybe the Studio's locked toolbox or bureau has something, but the user hasn't checked those. However, the original plan was to go east from the Chamber, which led to the Laundromat, then back. So perhaps the correct next step is to go east from the Attic to break the loop and proceed towards the bar.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Scullery, Studio, and Attic. The goal is to get the passkey from the bar. They've been moving back and forth without making progress. The key is to find a way out of this loop and reach the bar.

First, the goal steps are: go south from cookhouse, west, south, east, east, then get the passkey. But they're not reaching the bar yet. The current position is the Attic, so they need to find another exit. The Attic has an east exit, which was previously tried but maybe hasn't been explored properly. Alternatively, maybe the Studio's locked toolbox or bureau has something, but the user hasn't checked those. However, the original plan was to go east from the Chamber, which led to the Laundromat, then back. So perhaps the correct next step is to go east from the Attic to break the loop and proceed towards the bar.

Look over there! a case. You look around you, at all the containers and supporters, doors and objects, and you think to yourself. Why? Why Textworld? You can see a fridge. The fridge is empty! What a waste of a day!

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Scullery, Studio, and Attic. The goal is to get the passkey from the bar. They've been moving back and forth without making progress. The key is to find a way out of this loop and reach the bar.

First, the goal steps are: go south from cookhouse, west, south, east, east, then get the passkey. But they're not reaching the bar yet. The current position is the Attic, so they need to find another exit. The Attic has an east exit, which was previously tried but maybe hasn't been explored properly. Alternatively, maybe the Studio's locked toolbox or bureau has something, but the user hasn't checked those. However, the original plan was to go east from the Chamber, which led to the Laundromat, then back. So perhaps the correct next step is to go east from the Attic to break the loop and proceed towards the bar.

Look over there! a case. You look around you, at all the containers and supporters, doors and objects, and you think to yourself. Why? Why Textworld? You can see a fridge. The fridge is empty! What a waste of a day!

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Scullery, Studio, and Attic. The goal is to get the passkey from the bar. They've been moving back and forth without making progress. The key is to find a way out of this loop and reach the bar.

First, the goal steps are: go south from cookhouse, west, south, east, east, then get the passkey. But they're not reaching the bar yet. The current position is the Attic, so they need to find another exit. The Attic has an east exit, which was previously tried but maybe hasn't been explored properly. Alternatively, maybe the Studio's locked toolbox or bureau has something, but the user hasn't checked those. However, the original plan was to go east from the Chamber, which led to the Laundromat, then back. So perhaps the correct next step is to go east from the Attic to break the loop and proceed towards the bar.
