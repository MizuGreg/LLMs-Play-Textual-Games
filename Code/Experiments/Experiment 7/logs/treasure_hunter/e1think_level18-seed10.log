It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! First stop, try to go to the west. Following that, make an effort to venture north. Next, venture east. Then, doublecheck that the portal is open. After that, make an effort to go to the north. Then, make absolutely sure that the gate inside the kitchenette is opened. After that, take a trip east. And then, pick-up the stick of butter from the floor of the cubicle. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Chamber =-
You are in a chamber.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

You've entered a basement. Let's see what's in here.

Hey, want to see a counter? Look over there, a counter. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it.

There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text-based game where they need to follow specific steps to reach the goal. The initial instructions mention exploring the world by going west, then north, east, checking a portal, ensuring a gate is open, moving east again, and picking up a stick of butter.

First, I need to recall the current state. The user started in the Chamber, went west to the Basement. The Basement has an unblocked exit to the east and north. The next steps according to the initial instructions were to go north, check the portal, ensure the kitchenette gate is open, go east, and pick up the butter.

But in the current state, the user is in the Basement. The previous action was "go west", which led to the Basement. Now, the next step according to the initial plan was to go north. However, the user's next action should be to go north from the Basement. But the user might be stuck in a loop if they keep going back and forth. Wait, the user's last action was going west, and now they're in the Basement. The Basement has an exit to the east and north. The next step in the original plan was to go north, but the user might have already done that. Wait, no, the initial instructions said after going west, venture north. So from the Chamber, go west to Basement, then from Basement, go north. But the user is now in the Basement, so the next step is to go north. However, the user might be in a loop if going north leads back to the Chamber. But according to the current description, the Basement has an exit to the north (unblocked) and east. So going north from the Basement would take them back to the Chamber. But the original plan was to go north from the Chamber, then west, then north again. Wait, maybe the user is following the steps correctly. Let me check the initial steps again.

Original steps: 1. Go west (from Chamber to Basement). 2. Go north (from Basement to where? Maybe to the Chamber again? But the user's next step should be to go north from the Basement. But the user's current position is the Basement, so the next action is to go north. However, the user might be in a loop if going north leads back to the Chamber, which was the starting point. But according to the game's description, the Chamber has an unblocked exit to the north and west. Wait, the initial description said in the Chamber: "You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west." So from the Chamber, going north or west. The user first went west to the Basement. Now, in the Basement, the exits are east and north. So going north from the Basement would take them back to the Chamber. But the original plan was to go north from the Chamber, then west, then north again. But the user is now in the Basement, so the next step is to go north (back to Chamber), then maybe proceed as per the original plan. However, the user might be stuck in a loop between Chamber and Basement. But the game's instructions say to go west, then north, then east, check portal, etc. So perhaps the user needs to go north from the Basement to the Chamber again, then proceed to go east from there. But the user's next action should be to go north from the Basement. However, the user might have already done that. Wait, the user's current position is the Basement, and the next step in the original plan was to go north. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action is to go north from the Basement. However, the user might be in a loop if going north leads back to the Chamber, which was the starting point. But according to the game's description, the Chamber has an exit to the north and west. So going north from the Basement would take them back to the Chamber. Then, from the Chamber, they can go east, as per the original plan. So the user's next action is to go north from the Basement. But the user might be repeating steps. However, the game's instructions say to go west, then north, then east, etc. So the user is following the steps correctly. Therefore, the next action is to go north.

-= Bedchamber =-
You are in a bedchamber. A normal one.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in TextWorld. The goal is to follow a specific sequence of actions: go west, then north, east, check the portal, go north again, open the kitchenette gate, go east, and pick up the butter.

First, the user started in the Chamber, went west to the Basement. Then they went north to the Bedchamber. Now, they're in the Bedchamber. The next step according to the initial instructions was to venture east after going north. But in the Bedchamber, the exit to the east is unblocked, and there's also a south exit. However, the user's next action should be to go east as per the plan. But wait, the user's previous action was going north from the basement to the bedchamber. The next step in the original plan was to go east from the bedchamber. So the next command should be "go east". But the user might be in a loop if they keep going back and forth. However, in the current state, the bedchamber has an east exit, so going east is the correct next step. The user hasn't yet checked the portal or the kitchenette gate, so those come later. The current step is to go east from the bedchamber. So the next action is "go east".

-= Spare Room =-
You arrive in a spare room. A standard kind of place.

You make out a toolbox. The toolbox is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a coffer. Oh, great. Here's a display. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. This always happens!

There is a closed portal leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

There is a passkey on the floor.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in TextWorld. The goal is to follow a specific sequence of actions: go west, then north, east, check the portal, go north again, open the kitchenette gate, go east, and pick up the butter stick.

Looking at the current room, the user is in the Spare Room. The previous actions were go west, go north, go east. Now, the next step according to the initial plan was to check if the portal is open. But in the Spare Room description, there's a closed portal leading north. The user needs to open it. However, the current prompt mentions a passkey on the floor. Maybe the passkey is needed to open the portal.

Wait, the user's next step after checking the portal would be to open the kitchenette gate. But first, they need to ensure the portal is open. Since the portal is closed, the user might need to pick up the passkey and use it to open the portal. But the passkey is on the floor here. So the next action should be to pick up the passkey. Then use it to open the portal. But the user's next command should be to pick up the passkey. However, the initial instructions said to check the portal first. But the portal is closed, so maybe the passkey is required. So the correct next step is to pick up the passkey. Then use it to open the portal. But according to the game's current state, the user is in the Spare Room, and the passkey is here. So the next action is to pick up the passkey. Then, perhaps use it to open the portal north. But the user's next command should be to pick up the passkey. However, the initial plan said to check the portal. But since it's closed, maybe the passkey is needed. So the next action is to pick up the passkey. Then, use it to open the portal. But the user's next step is to check the portal's status. But the portal is closed, so the user needs to find a way to open it. The passkey is here, so pick it up first. Therefore, the next action is to pick up the passkey.
