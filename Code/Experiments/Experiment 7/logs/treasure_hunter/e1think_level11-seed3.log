Welcome to TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, attempt to travel west. Once you accomplish that, pick-up the worm from the floor of the kitchenette. Alright, thanks!

-= Laundromat =-
You are in a laundromat.



There is an unguarded exit to the north. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Kitchenette =-
A well framed board tells you that you are now in the kitchenette.

You smell a sickening smell, and follow it to a saucepan. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

There is a worm on the floor.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text-based game set in a laundromat. Their task is to first travel west, then pick up a worm from the kitchenette's floor.

First, they went west, which took them to the kitchenette. Now, they need to pick up the worm. The current description mentions a worm on the floor, so the next step should be to pick it up. But the game might require a specific command like "take worm" or "pick up worm". Since the user is in the kitchenette and the worm is there, the correct action is to pick it up. The previous action was going west, which was the first step. Now, the next step is to pick up the worm. There's no loop here because they've moved to the kitchenette and the worm is present. So the next command should be "take worm" or "pick up worm".
