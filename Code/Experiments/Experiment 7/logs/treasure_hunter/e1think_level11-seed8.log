Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, venture east. If you can accomplish that, lift the nest of earwigs from the floor of the attic. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Cubicle =-
You are in a cubicle. A standard one. The room is well lit.

You can see a safe. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You can make out a table. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is an open passageway leading east. There is an open portal leading north. There is an open hatch leading west. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Attic =-
You've stumbled into an usual room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be usual. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the attic.

You make out a workbench. The workbench is typical. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is an open passageway leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

There is a nest of earwigs on the floor.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in the Attic, and there's a nest of earwigs on the floor. The goal is to lift that nest and win. The previous action was going east from the Cubicle to the Attic.

First, I need to confirm the current state. The user is in the Attic, which is the second room. The goal is to first go east (from Cubicle to Attic), then lift the earwig nest. But the user already did the first step (go east). Now, the next step is to lift the nest. However, the current room (Attic) has the nest on the floor. The user needs to interact with it. The available actions are west, north, south, but maybe there's a way to pick it up. Wait, the game might require a specific action like "lift" or "pick up" the nest. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next step is to lift the nest. But the user is in the Attic, and the nest is on the floor. So the correct action would be to try to lift it. However, the game might have specific verbs. The user's previous action was moving east, so now they need to interact with the nest. The answer should be "lift the nest of earwigs" or something similar. But the game might require the exact command. Looking back, the user is in the Attic, and the nest is present. So the next step is to lift it. Therefore, the next action is to lift the nest.

That's not a verb I recognise.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to solve this text-based game. The goal is to first go east, then lift the nest of earwigs in the attic. But the user tried "lift the nest of earwigs" and the system said that's not a recognized verb.

So, first, I need to recall the game's objective. The user has to venture east, then lift the earwig nest. They already went east from the cubicle to the attic. Now, in the attic, there's a nest on the floor. The problem is that "lift" isn't working. Maybe the correct verb is "pick up" or "take"? But in text adventures, sometimes the verbs are specific. Alternatively, maybe the command is "take the nest of earwigs" or "pick the nest".

Wait, the user's previous action was "go east", which worked. Then they tried "lift", which failed. So the next step is to figure out the correct action. Since "lift" isn't working, perhaps the correct verb is "take" or "pick up". Let me check the possible commands. In many text games, "take" is a common verb. So maybe "take the nest of earwigs" is the right command. Alternatively, "pick up" might be another option. But the system might expect "take".

So the steps are: go east (done), now in attic, need to take the nest. The user tried "lift", which didn't work. So the next action should be "take the nest of earwigs". That should be the correct command. Let me make sure there's no other possible verb. Maybe "grab"? But "take" is more likely. So the answer is "take the nest of earwigs".
