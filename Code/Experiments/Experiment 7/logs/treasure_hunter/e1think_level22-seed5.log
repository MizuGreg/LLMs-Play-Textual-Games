You are now playing a exciting round of TextWorld! Here is how to play! Your first objective is to go east. Then, try to travel south. And then, try to travel south. With that accomplished, try to venture west. Then, lift the gummy bear from the floor of the chamber. Got that? Good!

-= Scullery =-
You find yourself in a scullery. A typical one. You can barely contain your excitement.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

-= Bathroom =-
You are in a bathroom. A typical kind of place.

You can make out a closed drawer. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a bench. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

There is an unguarded exit to the south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is playing a text-based game where they need to follow specific directions to reach a goal. The current scenario is in a bathroom after moving east from the scullery. The objective is to go east, then south twice, then west, and lift the gummy bear.

First, I need to recall the steps. The user has already gone east from the scullery, which was the first step. Now they're in the bathroom. The next steps according to the initial instructions are to travel south twice. The bathroom has an unguarded exit to the south, so the user should go south. Then, from there, they need to go south again. After that, venture west and lift the gummy bear.

Looking at the current location, the bathroom has a south exit. The user's next move should be south. But wait, the user's previous action was going east, so the next step is south. The user hasn't gone south yet. So the next action is to go south. Then, from the next room, go south again. After that, west, and then pick up the gummy bear.

The user hasn't entered a loop here. They're moving in the correct direction. So the next command is to go south.

-= Study =-
Well I'll be, you are in a place we're calling a study. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a display.

There is an unguarded exit to the north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing a text adventure game called TextWorld. Their goal is to follow a specific path: go east, then south twice, then west, and finally lift the gummy bear.

So far, the user has moved from the Scullery to the Bathroom by going east, then from the Bathroom to the Study by going south. Now they're in the Study. The next step according to the original plan is to go south again. But the current room (Study) has an exit to the south, so going south again would be the next logical step. However, the user might be in a loop if they keep moving between rooms without making progress. But in this case, the Study's south exit is unblocked, so going south should take them to the next room. The next step after that would be to go west, then lift the gummy bear. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action is to go south again.

-= Cookhouse =-
Guess what, you are in the place we're calling the cookhouse.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing a text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and eventually lift a gummy bear. The current room is the cookhouse, and the previous actions were going east, south, and then south again. The goal is to go east, then south twice, then west, and lift the gummy bear.

Looking at the current room description for the cookhouse, the user is told that there's an exit to the south, west, and north. The prompt says "You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked."

Wait, the user's goal is to go east first, then south twice, then west. So far, they've gone east from the scullery to the bathroom, then south to the study, then south again to the cookhouse. Now, in the cookhouse, the next step according to the original plan is to go west. But the current room's description mentions that west is unblocked. However, the user might be stuck in a loop if they keep going south again. But the current room has exits to north, south, west. The user needs to go west to proceed towards the goal.

But the user's previous action was going south again, which might not be part of the original plan. The original plan after the cookhouse would be to go west. So the next step should be to go west. However, the user might have already done that. Wait, the user's previous steps were: scullery -> bathroom (east), then study (south), then cookhouse (south). Now, in the cookhouse, the next step is to go west as per the original plan. So the next action should be go west. But the current room's description says that west is unblocked. So the correct next step is to go west. The user might have been trying to go south again, but that's not part of the plan. So the answer should be go west.

-= Chamber =-
You've entered a chamber.

You make out a locker!

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

There is a gummy bear on the floor.

Okay, let me try to figure out what the next step should be here. The user's goal is to go east, then south twice, then west, and finally lift the gummy bear.

So far, the player has moved from the scullery to the bathroom, then to the study, cookhouse, and now the chamber. The current location is the chamber. The previous actions were go east, then south, then west. Wait, no, let me check the history again.

Wait, the first move was go east from scullery to bathroom. Then from bathroom, go south to study. Then from study, go south to cookhouse. Then from cookhouse, go west to chamber. Now in the chamber. The goal is to go east, then south twice, then west. But the user has already gone east (from scullery), then south (from bathroom to study), then south again (from study to cookhouse?), wait no. Let me retrace:

Original plan: go east (done), then travel south (from scullery east to bathroom, then south to study), then travel south again (from study to cookhouse?), but the cookhouse is south of the study? Wait, the study's exits are north, south, west. So from study, going south would lead to cookhouse. Then, the next step after that was go west to chamber. So the user has done: east, south, south, west. But the original plan was to go east, then south, then south, then west. So that's completed. Now, the next step is to lift the gummy bear. But the current location is the chamber, which has a gummy bear on the floor. So the next action should be to pick up the gummy bear. But the user's last action was go west, which brought them to the chamber. Now, in the chamber, the gummy bear is on the floor. So the correct action is to take the gummy bear. But the game might require using the command "take gummy bear" or something similar. However, the user's previous commands were all "go" commands. But in the chamber, the gummy bear is on the floor, so the player needs to pick it up. The problem is that the user's previous actions were all moving, and now they need to interact with the gummy bear. So the next step is to take the gummy bear. But the user's instructions say to output only the command. So the correct command here is "take gummy bear". But I need to check if that's the right action. The game's description says "lift the gummy bear from the floor of the chamber." So the command should be "lift gummy bear" or "take gummy bear". Since the user's previous actions were all "go" commands, maybe "take" is the right verb here. So the next action is "take gummy bear".
</think>take gummy bear
