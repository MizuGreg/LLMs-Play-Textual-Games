Welcome to TextWorld! Your first objective is to attempt to go north. Once you succeed at that, go to the north. With that accomplished, try to move east. After that, travel south. With that done, retrieve the American latchkey from the floor of the studio. Then, venture south. After that, unlock the American gate within the cubicle. Then, doublecheck that the American gate within the cubicle is wide open. Then, take a trip east. Then, try to take a trip east. And then, retrieve the keycard from the floor of the workshop. And once you've done that, you win!

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in the Spare Room, and the goal is to follow a series of steps to win the game. The initial steps were to go north from the Bedchamber, which led to the Spare Room. Now, the next step according to the original plan was to go east, but the user is in the Spare Room.

Looking at the current location, the Spare Room has exits to east, north, and south. The original plan after the Spare Room was to go east again, but maybe that's not the right path. Wait, the user's goal was to go north, then east, then south, then get the key, etc. But in the Spare Room, the user needs to check if moving north or south is possible. The original plan said after the Spare Room, go north again? Or maybe the next step was to go east. But the user is at the Spare Room, and the next step in the original plan was to go east from the Spare Room. However, the user might be stuck in a loop if they keep going back and forth.

Wait, the original instructions said after going north from the Bedchamber (which is done), then go east. But in the Spare Room, the exit to the east is unguarded. So maybe the next step is to go east from the Spare Room. But the user might be in a loop if they keep moving between rooms. However, the user's next action should be to go east from the Spare Room. But the user's previous action was going north from the Bedchamber, leading to the Spare Room. So the next step is to go east. But the user might have already done that. Wait, the original plan was: after going north, go east, then south, etc. So in the Spare Room, the next step is to go east. But the user is in the Spare Room now. So the next action should be to go east. But the user might be in a loop if they keep moving between rooms. However, according to the instructions, the user needs to follow the steps in order. So after the Spare Room, the next step is to go east. Then, after that, go south. But the user needs to check if that's the case. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go south from the Spare Room. Wait, the original plan said after going north from the Bedchamber, then go east. But in the Spare Room, the exit to the east is unguarded. So the user should go east from here. But the user's next action is to go east. However, the user might be in a loop if they keep moving between rooms. But according to the problem, the user needs to follow the steps as per the original plan. So the next step is to go east from the Spare Room. Then, after that, go south. But the user is in the Spare Room now, so the next action is to go east. Therefore, the correct next command is "go east".

Okay, let's see. The user is playing TextWorld and needs to follow a specific sequence of actions to win. Let me break down the current situation.

First, the goal is to go north, then east, then south, retrieve the American latchkey, go south again, unlock the American gate in the cubicle, check that it's open, go east again, and finally get the keycard from the workshop. Then win.

So far, the user has gone from the Bedchamber to the Spare Room, then to the Studio. In the Studio, they found the American latchkey on the floor. The next step according to the original plan was to venture south after retrieving the latchkey. But the user's last action was going east from the Spare Room to the Studio. Now, in the Studio, they need to pick up the latchkey. The next step after that would be to go south to the previous room, then proceed as per the plan.

Wait, the user's previous action was "go east" from the Spare Room to the Studio. Now, in the Studio, they need to pick up the latchkey. The next step is to retrieve it, then go south. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action should be to pick up the American latchkey. But the game might require moving first. Wait, the Studio has the latchkey on the floor. So the user needs to pick it up. But the prompt says "retrieve the American latchkey from the floor of the studio." So the next action is to take the latchkey. But in TextWorld, you usually have to pick up items by using "take" or "get" commands. However, the user's previous actions were "go north" and "go east", which are movement commands. The current room is the Studio, and the item is on the floor. So the next step is to pick up the latchkey. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action should be "take American latchkey" or "get American latchkey". But the user's last action was "go east", so the next step is to pick up the latchkey. Then, after that, go south as per the plan.

But the user's current location is the Studio. The next step in the goal is to retrieve the latchkey. So the correct action here is to take the latchkey. However, the user might have to move first. Wait, the Studio has the latchkey on the floor. So the user is already in the Studio, so they can pick it up. So the next action is to take the latchkey. Then, proceed to go south as per the plan. So the next command should be "take American latchkey".

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this TextWorld game and has to follow a specific sequence of actions to win. Let me break down what's been done so far.

First, the initial goal is to go north, then east, then south, retrieve the American latchkey, go south again, unlock the American gate in the cubicle, check that it's open, go east again, get the keycard from the workshop, and then win. 

Looking at the user's steps: They started in the bedchamber, went north to the spare room, then east to the studio. In the studio, they picked up the American latchkey. So far, they've completed the first part of the goal: going north, then east, then retrieving the latchkey. The next step according to the original plan was to go south from the studio. But the user hasn't done that yet. 

Wait, the current location is the studio. The next step in the goal is after retrieving the latchkey, they need to venture south, then unlock the gate. So after picking up the latchkey, the next action should be to go south. But the user's last action was taking the latchkey, so the next command should be to go south. 

But the user's last input was "take American latchkey", which worked. Now, the next step is to go south from the studio. The user hasn't done that yet. So the next command should be "go south". 

I need to make sure that the steps are followed in order. The user has to go south from the studio, then proceed to the next area where the American gate is. So the next action is definitely "go south".

The goal is to go north, then east, south, retrieve the American latchkey, go south again, unlock the American gate in the cubicle, check it's open, go east, retrieve the keycard from the workshop, and then win.

So far, the user has moved from the bedchamber to the spare room, then to the studio where they picked up the American latchkey. Then they went south to the cubicle. Now, in the cubicle, they need to unlock the American gate. The next step after getting the latchkey was to go south to the cubicle. Now, in the cubicle, the American gate is closed. The next action should be to unlock it. But the game might require using the American latchkey to unlock it. So the correct command here is to use the latchkey on the gate. But the previous action was going south, so the next step is to unlock the gate. The user has to make sure they use the correct object and action. The command should be "unlock American gate" or "use American latchkey on American gate". But in the game's context, maybe "unlock American gate" is the right command. Let me check the previous steps. The user has the latchkey, so they need to use it to unlock the gate. The correct command here is "unlock American gate".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the steps to win the game. Let me recap the current state.

First, the goal is to go north, then east, south, retrieve the American latchkey from the studio, then south again, unlock the American gate in the cubicle, check that it's open, go east, get the keycard from the workshop, and then win. 

So far, the user has gone north from the bedchamber to the spare room, then east to the studio. In the studio, they picked up the American latchkey. Then they went south to the cubicle, unlocked the American gate. Now, the next step according to the original plan was to double-check that the gate is open. But the user just unlocked it, so maybe they need to verify it's open. However, the game might not require a separate check, just confirming that the gate is unlocked. 

But the next step in the original instructions was after unlocking the gate to "doublecheck that the American gate within the cubicle is wide open." So maybe the user needs to confirm the gate is open. However, after unlocking, it's probably already open. But the game might require an explicit check. Alternatively, maybe the next step is to go east from the cubicle. 

Wait, the user is in the cubicle now. The cubicle has an exit to the north, west, and the American gate east is unlocked. The next step in the original plan was after unlocking the gate to "doublecheck that the American gate within the cubicle is wide open." So maybe the user needs to check the gate's state. But since they just unlocked it, perhaps the game considers it open. However, the user might need to confirm. But the game's response after unlocking didn't mention anything about the gate being open, so maybe the next step is to go east through the gate. 

Alternatively, the user might be in a loop if they keep going back and forth. But the current location is the cubicle, and the next step is to go east through the unlocked gate. The original plan says after unlocking, double-check the gate is open, then take a trip east. So maybe the next action is to go east. 

But the user's last action was unlocking the gate. The next step would be to check if the gate is open, but since it's unlocked, maybe the game allows moving through it. So the next command should be "go east" to proceed. However, the user might need to confirm the gate is open first. But the game might not require that. So the correct next step is to go east through the unlocked gate. Therefore, the next action is "go east".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the steps to win the game. They've already gone north from the bedchamber, then east to the spare room, then east again to the studio. In the studio, they picked up the American latchkey and went south to the cubicle. They unlocked the American gate and tried to go east, but the game said they need to open the gate first.

Wait, they already unlocked the gate in the previous step. Maybe the game is confused? Or maybe they need to check if the gate is open. The error message says they have to open the gate first, but they just unlocked it. Hmm. Maybe the game expects them to confirm it's open. So the next step should be to check if the gate is open, but the user can't use "check" or "look". Alternatively, maybe they need to go through the gate again. But the previous action was unlocking, so perhaps the next step is to go east again, but the game is blocking it. Wait, the user's last action was "go east", which failed. So the next action should be to open the gate again, but they already have the key. Maybe the game is in a loop here. The user needs to find a way to proceed. The next command should be to go east again, but maybe the game requires a different verb. Alternatively, maybe "open American gate" again. But the user already unlocked it. Wait, the game says "You unlock American gate." So maybe the gate is now open. The error message says "You have to open the American gate first." But they just unlocked it. Maybe the game is expecting them to go through the gate. So the next action should be "go east" again. But the game is preventing it. Maybe the user needs to use a different verb, like "enter" or "pass", but the game only accepts "go". Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check if the gate is open. But the game doesn't have a "check" command. So the next step is to try "go east" again, even though it's blocked. The user might be in a loop here, so the assistant needs to suggest a different action. But the only possible action is "go east". Maybe the game is malfunctioning, but the user has to proceed. So the next command is "go east".

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in the Cubicle room, trying to go east but the American gate is closed. They already unlocked the gate, so maybe they need to check if it's fully open. The previous attempt to go east failed because the gate wasn't open. Wait, but they just unlocked it. Maybe the gate is locked again? Or maybe they need to confirm it's open. The game might be checking if the gate is open before allowing movement. So the next step is to make sure the American gate is open. Since the user has the latchkey, they might need to use it again to open the gate. But they already used it to unlock it. Hmm, maybe the gate is still closed, so they need to try opening it again. Alternatively, maybe they need to check the status of the gate. But the game's message says "You have to open the American gate first," so perhaps the gate is not fully open. The user needs to open it again. So the next action should be to open the American gate again, even though they already unlocked it. But the game might require that action again.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in TextWorld to complete a series of tasks. The goal is to go north, then east, then south, retrieve the American latchkey, go south again, unlock the American gate in the cubicle, check that it's open, go east, retrieve the keycard from the workshop, and then win.

So far, the user has gone north from the bedchamber to the spare room, then east to the studio. In the studio, they picked up the American latchkey. Then they went south to the cubicle, unlocked the American gate, and opened it. Now they're in the cubicle after opening the gate.

The next step according to the original plan was to go east from the cubicle to retrieve the keycard from the workshop. But the user tried going east again after unlocking the gate, but the game said they had to open the gate first. After opening it, they're now in the cubicle. So the next logical step is to go east from the cubicle to reach the workshop where the keycard is located. Since the gate is now open, they can proceed east. The keycard is on the floor of the workshop, so after getting there, they can pick it up and win.

So the next action should be to go east from the cubicle. The user has already tried that, but maybe they need to confirm again. However, since the gate is open now, going east should be possible. The command would be "go east".

FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is playing a text adventure game where they need to follow a specific sequence of actions to win. The goal is to go north, then east, then south, retrieve the American latchkey from the studio, go south again, unlock the American gate in the cubicle, check that it's open, go east, retrieve the keycard from the workshop, and then win.

Looking at the current state: The user is in the Laundromat. The previous steps have been successfully completing the initial directions, getting the latchkey, unlocking the gate, and moving east to the laundromat. Now, the next step according to the original plan was to retrieve the keycard from the workshop. But the user is in the laundromat, which suggests they might need to navigate further.

Wait, the original instructions said after unlocking the gate, they should check it's open, then go east again. But in the current location, the user is in the Laundromat, which has an open wooden passageway leading east. The next step would be to go east from here. However, the original plan mentioned retrieving the keycard from the workshop. So maybe the workshop is east of the laundromat. The user needs to go east through the wooden passageway to reach the workshop. Therefore, the next action should be to go east.

Well, here we are in a workshop. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.



There is an open pine door leading east. There is an open wooden passageway leading west. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north.

There is a keycard on the floor.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let me try to figure out the next step here. The user is in the Workshop, and the goal is to retrieve the keycard from the floor of the workshop and then win. The previous steps have been going through various rooms, unlocking the American gate, and now they're here.

Looking at the current room description: the Workshop has a keycard on the floor. The user needs to take the keycard. The previous action was going east to get here, and now the keycard is present. So the next logical step is to pick up the keycard. The user has already done most of the required steps: went north, east, south, retrieved the latchkey, unlocked the gate, etc. Now the final step is to take the keycard here. Once that's done, the game should be won. So the command should be "take keycard".
