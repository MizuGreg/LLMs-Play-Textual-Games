You are now playing a fast paced episode of TextWorld! First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to try to go to the north. Following that, make it so that the portal within the kitchen is open. And then, try to take a trip east. After that, try to head south. And then, pick-up the teaspoon from the floor of the cookhouse. Got that? Good!

-= Cookery =-
You find yourself in a cookery. A normal one.



There is an unblocked exit to the east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is playing a text-based game where they need to follow a series of steps. The initial instructions were to go north, open the portal in the kitchen, then go east, south, and pick up the teaspoon in the cookhouse.

First, the user went north, which took them to the kitchen. Then they tried to open the portal east, but the system kept repeating that the portal was closed. The user is now stuck in a loop where every time they try to open the portal, it's still closed, and the system isn't acknowledging progress.

So, the goal is to break this loop. The previous action was opening the portal east, but it's not working. Maybe the correct term isn't "open portal east" but something else like "activate portal" or "unblock portal". The system might be expecting a different command. Alternatively, maybe there's another way to proceed without repeatedly trying to open the same portal.

Looking at the kitchen description again: there's a closed fridge, a closed portal east, an open gateway north, and an unguarded exit south. The user has already gone north from the cookery to the kitchen. The next step after opening the portal east would be to go east through it. But since the portal is closed, they can't go through. So perhaps the correct action is to use a synonym for "open" like "unblock" or "activate".

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to interact with the fridge first. But the original plan was to open the portal. Since the system isn't recognizing the "open portal east" command, the next step should be to try a different verb. Let's try "unblock portal east" instead.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is stuck in the kitchen trying to open the portal east. They've tried "open portal east" multiple times, but the system isn't recognizing it. The goal is to proceed through the portal, then go east, south, and pick up the teaspoon.

First, the goal steps are: go north (done), open portal east (failed), go east, go south, pick up teaspoon. The user is currently in the kitchen, and the portal east is closed. The previous attempts to open it didn't work. The system might be expecting a different command, like "unblock" or "activate", but those weren't accepted either. The user tried "use portal east", which also didn't work.

So, the next step is to find another way to open the portal. Maybe the correct verb is "unblock" but the system doesn't recognize it. Alternatively, perhaps there's a different action needed. Since the user is stuck, they need to try a different command. The key is to avoid repeating the same action. Maybe the portal can be opened by interacting with it in a different way, like "open the portal east" instead of "open portal east". Or maybe there's a tool needed, like using the butter from the floor. But the user hasn't picked that up yet.

Wait, the user is in the kitchen, and there's a stick of butter on the floor. Maybe the butter is needed to open the portal. But the original instruction was to open the portal, so perhaps the correct action is to use the butter on the portal. But the user hasn't tried that yet. However, the user's previous actions were focused on opening the portal. Alternatively, maybe the portal can be opened by going north through the open gateway. But the user is in the kitchen, and the gateway north is open. Wait, the kitchen has an open gateway north. So maybe the user can go north from the kitchen through the open gateway, then proceed to the next area. But the original plan was to go east through the portal. However, if the portal is closed, maybe the user needs to find another way. But the user's next step after opening the portal is to go east. So perhaps the correct action is to go north through the open gateway, then proceed. But the user's goal was to go east after opening the portal. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the user should try to use the butter to open the portal. The stick of butter is on the floor. So the user could pick it up first, then use it on the portal. But the user hasn't picked up the butter yet. So the steps would be: pick up butter, then use it on the portal. But the user's current action is stuck on opening the portal. So the next step is to pick up the butter, then use it to open the portal. But the user hasn't done that yet. However, the user's previous actions were focused on opening the portal. So maybe the correct next step is to pick up the butter, then use it on the portal. But the user hasn't tried that. Alternatively, maybe the portal can be opened by using the butter. But the system might not recognize that. Alternatively, the user might need to go north through the open gateway, then proceed. But the user's original plan was to go east through the portal. So the user is stuck because the portal is closed. The correct action here is to try a different command to open the portal, like "unblock" or "activate", but those weren't accepted. The user tried "use portal east", which didn't work. So maybe the correct command is "open the portal east" with the article. Or maybe the system expects "open portal east" but it's not working. The user is in a loop, so they need to try a different action. The next step is to pick up the butter, then use it to open the portal. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action should be to pick up the butter.
