-= Studio =-
Look around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a studio. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You can make out a stand. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is an open passageway leading north. There is an open hatch leading west.

You find yourself in a kitchenette. The room is well lit.

You can make out a chair. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

-= Lounge =-
You find yourself in a lounge. A normal kind of place. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

This might come as a shock to you, but you've just walked into a pantry. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You make out a shelf. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the shelf.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

You can see a pan. The pan is normal. But there isn't a thing on it.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a TextWorld game and needs to follow a specific sequence of movements to reach the goal. The initial instructions mention moving west, then west again, north, and so on. But the user has already gone through several rooms: Studio → Playroom → Kitchenette → Lounge → Pantry → Cookhouse. Now, in the Cookhouse, the available exits are north, south, and west.

The user's goal, as per the original prompt, was to eventually pick up the loaf of bread from the dish-pit. So far, the user hasn't found the bread yet. The current location is the Cookhouse. The next step in the original instructions was to go north again after some previous steps. But in the Cookhouse, going north leads to another room, which might be part of the path to the dish-pit.

Wait, the user's previous actions were: go west (Studio → Playroom → Kitchenette → Lounge → Pantry → Cookhouse). Now, in the Cookhouse, the exits are north, south, west. The original instructions said after reaching the Cookhouse, the next step was to go north again. But the user needs to check if the bread is in the dish-pit, which might be in a different room. However, the user hasn't encountered the dish-pit yet. 

Looking at the previous rooms, the dish-pit isn't mentioned in any of the descriptions. The user might need to explore further. The next step would be to go north from the Cookhouse. If that leads to a room with the dish-pit, then the user can pick up the bread. Alternatively, maybe the dish-pit is in the Pantry or another room. But according to the current room descriptions, the Cookhouse has a pan, but no bread. 

So the next logical step is to go north from the Cookhouse. That would take the user to the next room, which might be the dish-pit. Therefore, the correct action is to go north again.

-= Canteen =-
You have walked into a canteen. Not the canteen you'd expect. No, this is a canteen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You see an opened freezer in the corner. What a letdown! The freezer is empty!

There is an open gate leading east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.
