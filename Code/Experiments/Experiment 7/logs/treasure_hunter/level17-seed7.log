Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an profound round of TextWorld? You do! Here is your task for today. First thing I need you to do is to go to the south. If you can finish that, make an effort to take a trip south. And then, try to venture east. Once you finish that, make an attempt to head north. Following that, head north. After that, attempt to travel east. Then, pick up the latchkey from the pan. Alright, thanks!

-= Dish-Pit =-
Well I'll be, you are in a place we're calling a dish-pit. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.



There is an open door leading north. There is an open passageway leading south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

I am sorry to announce that you are now in the cubicle.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to navigate through the TextWorld game by moving in specific directions and eventually picking up the latchkey from the pan. The initial instructions were to go south, then east, then north, and so on.

Looking at the current location, the user is in the Cubicle. The previous steps have been moving south from the Dish-Pit, then to the Recreation Zone, Laundry Place, Bedroom, Bathroom, and now the Cubicle. The next step according to the original plan was to go east from the Cubicle, but the prompt says to try going east. However, the Cubicle's description mentions an open gateway leading south and suggests trying east. 

Wait, the user is in the Cubicle. The available exits are south and east. The user has already gone north from the Bathroom to the Cubicle. The next step in the original plan was to go east after heading north. But the user is now in the Cubicle, and the next step would be to go east. However, the user might be stuck in a loop if moving east doesn't lead to progress. But the Cubicle's description says there's an unguarded exit east, so maybe that's the way to go. 

But the user needs to pick up the latchkey from the pan. The pan is mentioned in the Laundry Place, but the user hasn't interacted with it yet. However, the current location is the Cubicle. Wait, maybe the pan is in the Laundry Place. The user was in the Laundry Place earlier, but didn't pick up anything. The goal is to pick up the latchkey from the pan, which might be in the Laundry Place. But the user hasn't gone back there yet. 

Wait, the user's path so far has been: Dish-Pit (south) -> Recreation Zone (south) -> Laundry Place (east) -> Bedroom (north) -> Bathroom (north) -> Cubicle (north). So the user is now in the Cubicle. The next step according to the original plan was to go east from the Cubicle. But the Cubicle's description says to try going east. So the user should go east from the Cubicle. However, the user might be in a loop if moving east leads back to previous areas. But the Cubicle's description says there's an unguarded exit east, so maybe that's the correct direction. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go back west from the Cubicle to the Bathroom, then north to the Bedroom, then west to the Laundry Place to pick up the latchkey. But the original plan was to go east after heading north. However, the user is now in the Cubicle, and the next step is to go east. Let's check the current location again. The Cubicle has an open gateway south and an open portal west. Wait, no, the Cubicle's description says: "There is an open gateway leading south. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east." So the user is in the Cubicle, and the exits are south and east. The user needs to go east. But the user might have already been there. However, the user hasn't picked up the latchkey yet. The latchkey is from the pan, which is in the Laundry Place. The user was in the Laundry Place earlier but didn't pick up anything. So maybe the user needs to go back to the Laundry Place via the west exit from the Cubicle. Wait, the Cubicle's description says there's a west portal. So from the Cubicle, go west to the Bathroom, then north to the Bedroom, then west to the Laundry Place. Then pick up the latchkey from the pan. But the user hasn't done that yet. However, the original instructions said to go south, then east, then north, etc. But the user is now in the Cubicle, and the next step is to go east. But the user might be stuck in a loop. Alternatively, maybe the user should go west from the Cubicle to the Bathroom, then north to the Bedroom, then west to the Laundry Place, then pick up the latchkey. But the user hasn't done that yet. However, the original plan was to go east after heading north. But the user is in the Cubicle, so the next step is to go east. However, the user might be in a loop. So the user needs to find a different action. But the Cubicle's description says to try going east. So the user should go east. But the user is in the Cubicle, and the east exit is available. So the next action is to go east. However, the user might not have progress. But according to the game's structure, moving east from the Cubicle is the next step. So the answer is to go east.

-= Cookhouse =-
Wow! You're in a cookhouse. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You make out a pan. The pan is ordinary. On the pan you see a latchkey. You scan the room, seeing a bowl. However, the bowl, like an empty bowl, has nothing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the bowl.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.
