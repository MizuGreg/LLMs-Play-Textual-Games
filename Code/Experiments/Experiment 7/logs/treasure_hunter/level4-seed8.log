Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an fast paced round of TextWorld? You do! Here is your task for today. Your first objective is to make an effort to move east. Okay, and then, recover the shoe from the floor of the attic. Alright, thanks!

-= Cubicle =-
You are in a cubicle. An ordinary one. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

-= Attic =-
Well, here we are in the attic.



There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

There is a latchkey and a shoe on the floor.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text-based game where they need to recover a shoe from the attic. Their first objective was to move east, which they did, taking them from the cubicle to the attic. Now, in the attic, they see a latchkey and a shoe on the floor. The goal is to recover the shoe.

First step: The main goal is to get the shoe. The user has already moved east to the attic. Now, they need to pick up the shoe. But the shoe is on the floor, so they need to take it. The problem might be that they need to use the latchkey somehow, but the instruction says to focus on the shoe. So the next action should be to take the shoe. But wait, in text adventures, sometimes you have to use items or check inventory. However, the user is in the attic, and the shoe is on the floor. So the correct action is to take the shoe. The previous action was moving east, which was necessary to reach the attic. Now, the next step is to pick up the shoe. The user hasn't done that yet, so the next command should be "take shoe" or "get shoe". The answer should be concise, just the command.
</think>take shoe
