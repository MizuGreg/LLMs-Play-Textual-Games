You are now playing a life changing game of TextWorld! First stop, ensure that the gateway is open. After that, make an effort to move east. Then, open the portal. Then, try to take a trip south. After that, make sure that the passageway is ajar. After opening the passageway, make an effort to travel east. After that, pick-up the nest of earwigs from the floor of the attic. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Bedroom =-
You arrive in a bedroom. An ordinary kind of place. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You see a box. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The box contains a burger, so there's that.

There is a closed gateway leading east. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

-= Recreation Zone =-
You find yourself in a recreation zone. A standard kind of place. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You make out a suitcase. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a locked locker close by. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a shelf. But the thing is empty.

There is a closed portal leading south. There is an open gateway leading west. There is an unguarded exit to the east.

-= Cubicle =-
You are in a cubicle. A standard one. The room is well lit.

You can see a safe. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You can make out a table. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is a closed passageway leading east. There is an open portal leading north. There is an open hatch leading west. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Attic =-
You've stumbled into an usual room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be usual. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the attic.

You make out a workbench. The workbench is typical. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is an open passageway leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

There is a nest of earwigs on the floor.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in the Attic room. The goal is to pick up the nest of earwigs from the floor of the attic. The previous steps were opening various passages and portals, moving east to get here. Now, the nest is mentioned here. So the next step should be to take the nest. But the command might need to be "take nest of earwigs" or something similar. Let me check the previous actions. The user had to open the gateway, then portal, passageway, and move east. Now, in the Attic, the nest is on the floor. So the correct action is to take it. The user hasn't done that yet. So the next command should be to take the nest.
</think>take nest of earwigs
