Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, you could, like, ensure that the oak door is open. After that, attempt to go north. With that accomplished, make an effort to go to the west. Following that, lift the fresh laundry scented key from the floor of the shower. After you have picked up the fresh laundry scented key, doublecheck that the fresh laundry scented door inside the shower is unlocked. And then, ensure that the fresh laundry scented door inside the shower is open. And then, take a trip north. Then, make an effort to go to the east. Okay, and then, open the portal within the studio. After you have opened the portal, head north. Then, pick-up the latchkey from the floor of the cubicle. Alright, thanks!

-= Closet =-
You are in a closet. A normal kind of place.



There is a closed oak door leading north. There is an open wooden gateway leading west.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a closet with a closed oak door north and an open wooden gateway west. The goal is to follow a series of steps: open the oak door, go north, go west, pick up the key from the shower, unlock and open the fresh laundry door, then go north again, east, open the portal in the studio, and pick up the latchkey.

So far, the user tried to go north but was told to open the oak door first. Then they opened the oak door. Now, the next step should be to go north after the door is open. The current location is the closet, and after opening the oak door, the next logical step is to move north into the next room. The user has already taken the first two steps: opening the oak door and attempting to go north. The next step is to go north again once the door is open. Since the previous action was going north, but the door was closed, now that it's open, moving north should be possible. The user needs to go north, then west, etc. So the next command should be "go north".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps to complete the game. The current location is the Shower, where they picked up the fresh laundry scented key. The next step was to open the fresh laundry scented door, but they were told they need to unlock it first with the key.

So, the goal is to open the door after unlocking it. The user has already picked up the key, so the next logical step is to use the key to unlock the door. Since they tried to open the door directly and were told to unlock it first, they need to use the key. The correct action here is to unlock the door with the key. The previous action was attempting to open it, which wasn't successful. So the next action should be to unlock it instead. The command should be "unlock fresh laundry scented door".

Okay, let's break this down. The user is trying to follow a sequence of steps in the game. The current situation is in the Shower, where they have the fresh laundry scented key and just tried to unlock the door. The system responded that "open fresh laundry scented door" is not a recognized verb. The user needs to figure out the correct action.

First, the goal is to open the fresh laundry scented door after unlocking it. The user already has the key and unlocked the door. The next step should be to open the door. But the system said "open" isn't a valid verb here. Maybe the correct command is "push" or "enter"? But the game might expect a specific verb. Since the user previously used "unlock", maybe the next step is to "open" the door, even if the system says it's not a verb. Alternatively, maybe "use" the key to open it. But the user already unlocked it. Wait, the previous action was "unlock fresh laundry scented door", and the system said "You open fresh laundry scented door." But the user tried to use "open" again and got an error. So perhaps the correct action is to "push" the door open. But the game might have specific commands. The user needs to try a different verb. Since the system didn't recognize "open", maybe the correct command is "push" or "enter". But the user's next step is to open the door after unlocking. The correct action here is to "open" the door, even if the system says it's not a verb. Alternatively, maybe the door is already unlocked and needs to be opened by pushing. So the next command should be "push fresh laundry scented door".

The previous steps were: open the oak door, go north, go west, pick up the key, unlock the door. Now, after unlocking, the door is closed but they can't open it. The system says "push" isn't a verb. Maybe the correct action is to "open" the door despite the error. Alternatively, maybe the door requires a different action, like "use" the key again. But the key was already used to unlock. Wait, maybe the door is locked again? No, they just unlocked it. The user needs to find another way. Since "push" isn't working, maybe the correct command is "open" the door. The system might have a typo, so trying "open" again. Alternatively, maybe "enter" the room. But the goal is to open the door. So the next step is to try "open fresh laundry scented door" again, even if the system says it's not a verb. Maybe the game expects that command. So the answer is "open fresh laundry scented door".

The system responded with "You enter fresh laundry scented door." but the user is getting an error about not recognizing a verb.

First, the goal is to open the portal in the studio after going through the shower. The user has already picked up the key, unlocked the door, and opened it. Now they are in the studio. The next step was to go north, then east, open the portal, and pick up the latchkey.

But the user is in the Shower again, maybe they got confused. Wait, the previous action was entering the fresh laundry scented door, which led to the Studio. Now, the user needs to proceed to the studio's portal. The next step is to go north from the Studio, then east, open the portal, and pick up the latchkey.

FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in the Serious Studio and needs to open the portal. They've tried "open portal within the studio" and "open portal in the studio" but got errors. The goal is to open the portal after going north, east, etc. The previous steps were: open oak door, go north, go west, pick up key, unlock door, open door, enter, then stuck. Now, in the studio, the user needs to find the portal. Since the studio has an open oak door south and open wooden door west, maybe the portal is through the west door. But the user already went west. Alternatively, maybe the portal is in the studio itself, but the user can't see it. The correct action might be to check the stand or look around. The user tried to open the portal but couldn't. The next step is to look for the portal's location. The command should be "look around" or "examine stand". But the game might expect a different verb. Since the user can't see the portal, maybe they need to use a different action. The correct command here is "look around" to find the portal.

Okay, the user is stuck in the Serious Studio and can't find the portal. They've tried multiple commands like "open portal" and "look around" but get errors. The goal is to open the portal in the studio. The previous steps were: open oak door, go north, go west, pick up key, unlock door, open door, enter. Now, in the studio, the user needs to find the portal. Since they can't see it, maybe the portal is hidden or requires a different action. The correct step is to check the stand mentioned earlier. The user might need to "examine stand" to find the portal. The command should be "examine stand".

Okay, the user is in the Serious Studio and has been trying to find the portal without success. The stand is solid, so examining it again isn't helping. The goal is to open the portal in the studio. The previous steps were: open oak door, go north, go west, pick up key, unlock door, open door, enter, then stuck. Now, in the studio, the user needs to find the portal. Since the stand is solid, maybe the portal is elsewhere. The user might need to check the other doors or look for clues. The correct action here is to check the open wooden door leading west again. The command should be "go west".

You've walked into a normal room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be normal. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the workshop. Let's see what's in here.



There is an open fresh laundry scented door leading south. There is an open gateway leading east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

You find yourself in a workshop. A serious one. The room is well lit.

You can make out a mantle. The mantle is typical. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

-= Salon =-
You've entered a salon. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

Hey, want to see a bed stand? Look over there, a bed stand. On the bed stand you make out a fondue. You can see a bench. But the thing is empty. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.
