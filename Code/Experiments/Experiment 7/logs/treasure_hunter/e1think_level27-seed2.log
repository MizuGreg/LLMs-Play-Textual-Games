Welcome to TextWorld! Here is your task for today. Your first objective is to try to travel east. With that done, make absolutely sure that the door in the shower is unlocked. And then, make sure that the door in the shower is ajar. After that, head south. After that, go west. With that done, try to head south. And then, travel west. That done, go to the south. Then, venture west. Once you succeed at that, take a trip south. Next, travel east. If you can manage that, attempt to venture east. Then, take a trip north. With that over with, retrieve the passkey from the floor of the spare room. That's it!

-= Parlor =-
You find yourself in a parlor. An usual kind of place.

You make out a bed stand. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the bed stand.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to follow a series of directions to navigate through different rooms and interact with objects. The first step was to go east from the parlor, which led to the shower. Now, in the shower, the task is to make sure the door in the shower is unlocked and ajar, then head south, west, etc.

Looking at the current location: the shower has a locked trunk, a table, a closed door south, and an exit west. The user needs to unlock the door in the shower. Since the door is closed, maybe they need to open it first. But the problem says the door is locked, so perhaps they need to find a key or use an object. However, the trunk is locked, and there's nothing on the table. Wait, the user's first objective after going east was to make sure the door in the shower is unlocked. But the door is closed, so maybe they need to open it. But how? Maybe there's a key in the trunk? But the trunk is locked. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to find a way to unlock the door without the key, but that's not possible here. Wait, the user's instruction says to make sure the door is unlocked and ajar. So maybe the door is locked, so they need to unlock it. But how? Maybe there's a key in the room. But the trunk is locked, and the table is empty. Hmm.

Wait, the user's first step was to go east, which they did. Now, they need to unlock the door in the shower. But the door is closed. So maybe the first thing is to open the door. But the door is locked, so they need to find a key. But where? The trunk is locked, so maybe they need to find a key elsewhere. Alternatively, maybe the door can be unlocked by another method. But in TextWorld, usually, you have to use items or commands. Since the trunk is locked and has nothing, maybe the key is in the parlor? But the user is in the shower now. Wait, the initial task says after going east, make sure the door in the shower is unlocked. So maybe the door is locked, so the user needs to find a way to unlock it. But how? Maybe there's a key in the parlor, but the user hasn't checked there yet. But the user is in the shower now. So perhaps the next step is to check the trunk for a key, but it's locked. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to find a way to unlock the door without the key, but that's not possible. Wait, maybe the user is supposed to use the 'unlock' command on the door. But the door is closed, so maybe they need to open it first. But the door is locked. So maybe the user needs to find a key. But where?

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to open the door, but since it's locked, they need to find a key. But the trunk is locked, so maybe the key is inside. But how to get it? The user can't open the trunk unless they have the key. This seems like a loop. So perhaps the user needs to find another way. Wait, the user's next step after unlocking the door is to head south, then west, etc. But if the door is locked, they can't proceed. So maybe the user needs to find a key first. But where? The table is empty. The trunk is locked. The only exit is west. Maybe the key is in the parlor, but the user is in the shower. So maybe the user needs to go back west to the parlor, then look for the key. But the initial task says after going east, make sure the door is unlocked. So perhaps the user is supposed to unlock the door in the shower, but how? Maybe the user can't do that yet, so they need to find a key. But the key isn't here. So maybe the user is stuck here. But the user's next step is to make sure the door is unlocked. So maybe the user needs to use the 'unlock' command on the door, but since it's locked, that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to find a key in the room. But the trunk is locked. So perhaps the user is in a loop here. The user tried to go east, then is in the shower. The next step is to unlock the door. But how? Maybe the user needs to find a key elsewhere. But the only way is to go back west to the parlor. So the user should go west to the parlor, then look for the key. But the parlor has a bed stand with nothing on it. So maybe the key is there. But the user hasn't checked. So the next step is to go west to the parlor, then check the bed stand for a key. Then go back east to the shower, unlock the door, then proceed. But the user's current location is the shower. So the next action should be to go west to the parlor. But the user's initial instruction says after going east, make sure the door is unlocked. So maybe the user needs to find the key in the parlor. Therefore, the next action is to go west to the parlor.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through TextWorld based on the given instructions. The initial goal was to travel east, then handle the shower door, and so on. But the user keeps getting stuck in a loop between the parlor and shower.

First, I need to restate the game's objective step by step. The main tasks are: go east, unlock and open the shower door, then move south, west, etc., finally retrieving the passkey.

Looking at the user's actions: they went east to the shower, then west back to the parlor. Now they're back in the parlor again. The problem is that the initial steps aren't being completed properly. The user hasn't addressed the shower door yet, which is a critical part of the objective.

The next step should be to handle the shower door. Since the user is in the parlor again, they need to go east again to the shower. Once there, they need to unlock and open the door. But the user might be repeating the same actions without progressing. So, instead of just "go east" again, maybe they need to use a different verb or check for other actions possible in the shower.

Wait, the user's last action was "go west" from the shower, which brought them back to the parlor. Now they're in the parlor again. The next logical step is to go east again to the shower, then handle the door. But the user might be stuck in a loop because they haven't completed the shower door tasks yet. So the key is to ensure that after going east to the shower, they unlock and open the door, then proceed as per the instructions.

Okay, let's break down the user's problem. They're in a text-based game where they need to follow a series of specific steps to complete their objective. The main goal is to navigate through different rooms and interact with objects, particularly focusing on the shower door.

First, the user's initial action was "go east," which took them to the shower. Then they tried "go west," which brought them back to the parlor. Now, they're back in the shower again. The challenge is to avoid looping between the parlor and the shower and instead complete the required tasks.

Looking at the steps mentioned in the task: the user needs to travel east, unlock and open the shower door, then go south, west, etc. But in the current state, they're stuck in the shower, having already tried going west and east. The next step should be to interact with the locked trunk or the door. However, the user's previous actions have not progressed beyond the shower, so they need to find a new action that isn't just moving between rooms but actually interacting with objects.

The key here is to unlock the door in the shower. The user needs to check if there's a way to unlock it. Since the trunk is locked, maybe the key is there. But the user hasn't checked the trunk yet. So the next logical step is to examine the trunk or try to open it. However, the user's previous actions were moving, not interacting with objects. So the next action should be to check the trunk or the door. But the door is closed and locked, so maybe the trunk has a key. Alternatively, the user might need to find a way to unlock the door.

But according to the game's current state, the user is in the shower, and the door is closed. The user needs to make sure the door is unlocked and ajar. So the next step is to try to unlock the door. However, the user hasn't done that yet. The previous actions were moving, so the next action should be to interact with the door or the trunk. Since the trunk is locked, maybe the key is there. But the user hasn't checked the trunk yet. So the correct action here is to check the trunk or try to open it. However, the user's last action was "go west," which brought them back to the parlor. Then they went east again to the shower. Now, they need to interact with the door or the trunk. The correct next step is to try to unlock the door, but since it's locked, maybe they need to find a key. Alternatively, the trunk might have a key. So the next action should be to check the trunk. But the user hasn't done that yet. Therefore, the next action is to look at the trunk or try to open it.

Okay, let's break down the user's problem. They're in a TextWorld game with a specific sequence of actions to complete. The goal is to travel east, unlock and open the shower door, then move south, west, etc., finally retrieving a passkey.

Looking at the current state: The user is in the Shower room. They just unlocked the door (step 5). The next steps according to the original task are to make sure the door is ajar. So after unlocking, they need to open it. The previous action was "unlock door", which is correct. Now, the next logical step is to open the door. But the game might require using a verb like "open" instead of "unlock" if the door is already unlocked. Wait, the user already unlocked it, so now they need to open it. But the game might have specific commands. The user's last action was "unlock door", and the response was successful. Now, the next step is to open the door. But the user's next command should be "open door" to make it ajar. Then, after that, they can proceed south as per the instructions. So the next action is to open the door.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in the TextWorld game. The goal is to travel east, unlock and open the shower door, then move south, west, etc., and finally retrieve the passkey.

So far, the user has gone east from the parlor into the shower. Then they tried going west, which brought them back to the parlor. Then they went east again into the shower. Now, they've unlocked and opened the door in the shower. The next step according to the original task was to head south after ensuring the door is unlocked and ajar. But after opening the door, the user is still in the shower. So the next logical step would be to go south through the opened door. However, the previous action was opening the door, and the user is now in the shower. The next step should be to move south. But the user might be in a loop between the parlor and shower. Wait, the current location is the shower, and the door is open. So the next action should be to go south through that door. But the user might have already tried that. Let me check the history.

The user's actions so far: go east (to shower), go west (back to parlor), go east (back to shower), unlock door, open door. Now, after opening the door, the next step is to go south. But the previous steps mention after opening the door, head south. So the next command should be 'go south' from the shower. But the user might be in a loop if they keep going back and forth. However, the current location is the shower, and the door is open. So the correct next step is to go south. But the user might have already done that. Wait, the original task says after making sure the door is unlocked and ajar, head south. So after opening the door (which is ajar), the user should go south. So the next action is 'go south'.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in the TextWorld game. The initial goal was to travel east, then handle the shower door, then move south, west, etc., and finally retrieve the passkey.

So far, the user has gone east from the parlor to the shower, unlocked and opened the shower door, then went south into the sauna. Now, the current location is the sauna. The next steps according to the original task were to go south again, then west, then south again, then east, north, and finally get the passkey from the spare room.

But in the current state, the user is in the sauna. The next step mentioned was "go south" again. However, the sauna has a door north and a portal west. The user might need to check if moving west is the next step, but according to the original plan, after entering the sauna, the next steps were to go south, then west. But the sauna's south direction might not be accessible. Alternatively, maybe the portal west is the way to go.

Wait, the user's previous action was "go south" into the sauna. Now, the next step in the original plan was to go south again. But in the sauna, there's no south direction mentioned. The available exits are north and west. So perhaps the user needs to go west from the sauna. But according to the original plan, after entering the sauna, the next steps were to go south, then west. But since the sauna doesn't have a south exit, maybe the user is in a loop here. Therefore, the correct next action would be to go west instead of south again.

So the user needs to go west from the sauna. That would be the next step to avoid the loop. Then, after moving west, they can proceed with the next steps as per the original plan. Therefore, the next action should be "go west".

Okay, let's break down the user's goal step by step. The main task is to follow a series of directions to reach the passkey in the spare room. So far, the user has moved east from the parlor to the shower, unlocked and opened the shower door to go south into the sauna, then west to the laundromat. Now, the next steps according to the original instructions are to go south from the laundromat, then west, then south again, and so on until reaching the spare room.

Looking at the current location, the laundromat has an open gate leading south. The next step should be to go south from here. The user has already done some steps, but they need to continue moving south and west as per the instructions. The key is to make sure each movement is correctly followed without getting stuck in a loop. Since the laundromat's south gate is open, "go south" is the logical next command. There's no indication of a loop here, so proceeding south makes sense.

Okay, let's try to figure out the next step here. The user's goal is to follow a series of directions to retrieve the passkey from the spare room. So far, they've gone east from the parlor, entered the shower, unlocked and opened the door, then went south to the sauna, west to the laundromat, south again to the bar. Now they're in the bar.

The next steps in the original task after reaching the bar would be to go south again, then west, then south, then west, and finally go to the south to retrieve the passkey. But the user is in the bar now. The bar has exits to north, east, south, and west. The next step according to the original plan is to go south from the bar. But the user might be stuck in a loop if they keep moving between rooms without progressing towards the spare room.

Wait, the original instructions say after getting to the bar, they need to go south, then west, then south, then west, then south again. But the user is in the bar, so the next action should be to go south. However, the user might have already done that. Let me check the steps again.

The user's path so far: parlor -> shower -> sauna -> laundromat -> bar. The next step in the original plan was to go south from the bar. But the user is in the bar now. The bar's south exit is unguarded. So the next action should be to go south from the bar. Then, after that, they need to go west, then south, then west again, and finally retrieve the passkey. But the user hasn't reached the spare room yet. So the next step is to go south from the bar. However, the user might have already done that. Wait, the user is at the bar, and the next step is to go south. Let me make sure that's the correct next step according to the original plan. The original plan says after the bar, go south, then west, then south, then west, then south. So from the bar, go south, then west, etc. So the next action is to go south from the bar. But the user is in the bar, so the next command should be "go south".

GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Spare Room =-
You are in a spare room. A normal kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

There is a passkey on the floor.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let me try to figure out what the next step should be here. The user's goal is to complete a series of actions in the TextWorld game. Let me recap the steps they need to take based on the initial task:

1. Travel east.
2. Unlock the door in the shower.
3. Make sure the shower door is ajar.
4. Go south.
5. Go west.
6. Go south again.
7. Go west again.
8. Go south again.
9. Go east.
10. Go east again.
11. Go north.
12. Retrieve the passkey from the spare room.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Spare Room and has found the passkey on the floor. The previous actions have led them through various rooms, and now they need to pick up the passkey. The next step should be to pick up the passkey. However, the user might need to check if they're in the correct room and if the passkey is accessible. Since the passkey is on the floor, the command should be to pick it up. But the game might require using a specific verb like "take" or "pick up". The correct command here would be "take passkey" or "pick up passkey". However, in TextWorld, the exact command might vary. Since the user is in the Spare Room and the passkey is on the floor, the correct action is to take the passkey. So the next command should be "take passkey".
