Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First thing I need you to do is to venture south. And then, open the passageway within the cubicle. After that, move east. With that over with, pick up the nest of earwigs from the floor of the attic. That's it!

-= Recreation Zone =-
You find yourself in a recreation zone. A standard kind of place. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You make out a suitcase. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a locked locker close by. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a shelf. But the thing is empty.

There is an open portal leading south. There is an open gateway leading west. There is an unguarded exit to the east.

-= Cubicle =-
You are in a cubicle. A standard one. The room is well lit.

You can see a safe. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You can make out a table. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is a closed passageway leading east. There is an open portal leading north. There is an open hatch leading west. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user wants me to navigate through the TextWorld game based on the given environment. The goal is to venture south, open the passageway in the cubicle, move east, and pick up the earwigs from the attic.

First, the user started in the Recreation Zone. They went south, which led them to the Cubicle. Now, in the Cubicle, the next step is to open the passageway leading east. The description mentions a closed passageway east, so I need to find a way to open it. The user might need to use an object or command to open it. Since the locker is locked, maybe a key is needed, but the user hasn't mentioned finding a key yet. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to interact with the safe or other objects to unlock it.

Wait, the user's goal is to open the passageway in the cubicle. The current room has a closed passageway east. The user needs to open it. The possible actions here are to interact with the safe, the table, or maybe the locker. But the locker is locked, so maybe the key is in the safe? Or perhaps there's a way to open the passageway directly. The user hasn't tried opening the passageway yet, so the next step would be to try opening it. But how? Maybe the command is "open passageway east" or "use key on passageway". However, the user hasn't found a key yet. Alternatively, maybe the safe contains a key. The user should check the safe first.

But the user's initial steps were to go south, then open the passageway. So in the Cubicle, after entering, the next step is to open the east passageway. The user might need to use a key from the safe. So first, check the safe for a key, then use it to open the passageway. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action would be to open the safe. Wait, the safe is mentioned as something that's there. So maybe the user needs to open the safe first to get a key. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the steps would be: open the safe, find a key, then use the key to open the passageway east.

But the user's goal is to open the passageway in the cubicle. So maybe the passageway is locked and requires a key. Therefore, the next step is to open the safe to get the key. Then use the key on the passageway. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action would be to open the safe. However, the user might not have a key yet. Alternatively, maybe the passageway can be opened without a key, but the description says it's closed. So the user needs to find a way to open it. The possible actions are to check the safe, look for a key, then use it. So the next step is to open the safe. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the answer should be to open the safe first.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to venture south, open the passageway in the cubicle, move east, and pick up the earwigs from the attic. So far, they've gone south into the cubicle and opened the safe. Wait, but the original instructions said to open the passageway within the cubicle first. Oh, maybe the safe is part of that? Or maybe opening the safe is a step towards opening the passageway.

Wait, the user's previous action was "open safe", and the response was "You open the safe." Now, the next step would be to check if that helps with opening the passageway. But the cubicle has a closed passageway leading east. So maybe the safe's contents are needed to open it? Or maybe opening the safe was a mistake because the actual goal was to open the passageway. But the user's initial steps were to go south, then open the passageway. So maybe the safe isn't part of the goal. Hmm, perhaps the user needs to find the correct action to open the passageway. Since the cubicle has a closed passageway east, maybe the safe is a red herring. Alternatively, maybe the safe's contents are needed to open the passageway. But the user hasn't picked up anything yet. Wait, the goal is to pick up the earwigs from the attic. So maybe after opening the passageway, they can move east and then go to the attic. But the user is in the cubicle now. So the next step after opening the safe would be to check if that helps open the passageway. But the game might require a different action. Alternatively, maybe the user should try to open the passageway directly. But the passageway is closed. So maybe the safe's key is needed. But the user hasn't found the key yet. Wait, the initial instructions said to open the passageway within the cubicle. So maybe the user needs to find a way to open it. But the safe was opened, but that might not be related. Maybe the user should check the safe's contents for a key or something. But the game's response after opening the safe didn't mention anything else. So perhaps the next step is to look for the key in the safe. But the user hasn't done that yet. Alternatively, maybe the passageway can be opened with a different action. But the user is in the cubicle, and the passageway is closed. So maybe the correct next step is to try to open the passageway, but how? Maybe using the key from the safe. But the user hasn't checked the safe's contents. So the next action should be to check the safe's contents. But the user's previous action was opening the safe, so maybe the next step is to look inside. But the game's response didn't mention that. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the key from the safe to open the passageway. But without knowing if the safe has a key, it's hard to say. Alternatively, maybe the user should try to open the passageway directly. But the game might require a specific action. Since the user is in the cubicle, the next step is to check the passageway. But it's closed. So maybe the user needs to find a way to open it. But the game might require a different action. Wait, the user's goal is to open the passageway in the cubicle. So the next step after opening the safe is to check if the safe has something that can open the passageway. But the user hasn't checked that yet. So the next action should be to look inside the safe. But the game's response after opening the safe didn't mention anything else. So maybe the user needs to check the safe's contents. But the user hasn't done that yet. Therefore, the next action should be to check the safe's contents. But the user's previous action was opening the safe, so maybe the next step is to look inside. However, the game might not allow that unless the user has the right action. Alternatively, maybe the user should try to open the passageway again. But the passageway is closed. So perhaps the correct next action is to look inside the safe for a key or something. But the user hasn't done that yet. Therefore, the next action is to check the safe's contents. But the user's previous action was opening the safe, so maybe the next step is to look inside. However, the game's response after opening the safe didn't mention anything else. So maybe the user needs to try a different action. Alternatively, maybe the user should proceed to the next step as per the original goal: after opening the passageway, move east and pick up the earwigs. But the user hasn't opened the passageway yet. So the next step is to open the passageway. But how? Maybe the safe's contents are needed. So the user should check the safe's contents. Therefore, the next action is to check the safe's contents. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action is to look inside the safe.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through a text-based game. The goal is to venture south, open the passageway in the cubicle, move east, and pick up the earwigs from the attic.

So far, the user has gone south from the recreation zone into the cubicle. Then they opened the safe, which might have been part of opening the passageway. Then they opened the passageway. Now, the next step after opening the passageway would be to move east as per the initial instructions. But the current location is the cubicle, and after opening the passageway, maybe they need to check the east direction. Wait, the cubicle has a closed passageway leading east, which they just opened. So moving east from there would take them through the opened passageway. Then, after moving east, they need to go to the attic to pick up the earwigs. But the user hasn't moved east yet. The previous action was opening the passageway, so the next logical step is to move east. But the user might have already done that? Wait, the initial instructions say after opening the passageway, move east. So after opening the passageway, the next action should be moving east. But in the current state, the user is in the cubicle, and the passageway east is open. So the next step is to go east. But the user's last action was opening the passageway, so the next command should be "go east". However, the user might have already done that. Wait, the game's current state after opening the passageway would allow moving east. So the next step is to move east. Then, after moving east, they would be in the next room, perhaps the attic, where they can pick up the earwigs. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action is to go east. But the user's previous action was opening the passageway, so the next step is to move east. Therefore, the correct command is "go east".

You've stumbled into an usual room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be usual. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the attic.

You make out a workbench. The workbench is typical. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is an open passageway leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

There is a nest of earwigs on the floor.

Okay, let's see. The user's goal is to venture south, open the passageway in the cubicle, move east, and pick up the nest of earwigs from the attic.

So far, the user has gone south to the cubicle, opened the safe, opened the passageway, and then went east to the attic. Now, in the attic, they need to pick up the earwigs. The current room is the attic, and there's a nest of earwigs on the floor. The next step should be to pick that up. The command would be "take nest of earwigs" or something similar. But the game might expect a specific phrase. Since the user is in the attic and the nest is on the floor, the correct action is to pick it up. The previous actions have already been completed except for this last step. So the next command should be to take the nest.
