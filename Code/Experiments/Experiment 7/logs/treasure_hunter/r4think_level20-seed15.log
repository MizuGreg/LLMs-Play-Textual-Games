THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing a text-based game called TextWorld. The goal is to follow a series of steps to achieve the objective, which from the initial instructions seems to involve navigating through different locations, opening gates, and retrieving an apple from a safe in a workshop.

First, I need to break down the steps given in the initial prompt. The user mentioned entering the laundromat, going west, checking the gateway, pulling it open, moving north, then west, south, and finally opening the safe to get the apple. But the current state shows the user is back in the laundromat after moving west again, which might indicate a loop.

Looking at the history, the user went west from the canteen, then back to the laundromat, then east again to the canteen. This back-and-forth suggests a loop between the laundromat and canteen. The next step according to the initial instructions was to go north after opening the gateway, but the user hasn't opened the gateway yet. However, the current location is the laundromat again, so maybe the user needs to check the locked basket or find a way to open the gateway.

Wait, the initial instructions said to make sure the gateway is open. The gateway is in the canteen, leading north. The user hasn't opened it yet. But the user is stuck in a loop between the two locations. So the problem is that the user is repeatedly moving between the laundromat and canteen without progressing. The next step should be to open the gateway in the canteen. But how? The gateway is closed, so maybe the user needs to find a way to open it. However, the user hasn't done that yet. But in the current state, the user is in the laundromat again, so perhaps the correct action is to check the locked basket or try to open the gateway from the canteen.

Wait, the user is in the laundromat again. The initial instruction said after going west, check the gateway. But the gateway is in the canteen. So maybe the user needs to go north from the canteen to open the gateway. But the user is in the laundromat, so they need to go east to the canteen again. Then, once in the canteen, check the gateway. But the user has been going back and forth between the two locations. So the next action should be to go north from the canteen to open the gateway. But the user is in the laundromat, so the correct step is to go east to the canteen again, then try to open the gateway. However, the user might be stuck in a loop because they keep moving between the two places without progressing. Therefore, the next action should be to go north from the canteen to open the gateway, but since the user is in the laundromat, they need to go east first. But the user's last action was go west, which brought them back to the laundromat. So the next step is to go east to the canteen again, then attempt to open the gateway. However, the user might need to use a different action if they're in a loop. The key is to avoid repeating the same action. So instead of going west again, maybe go east to the canteen and then open the gateway. But the user is in the laundromat, so the next action is to go east to the canteen.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is trying to navigate through a text-based game, following specific steps to open a gateway, move through locations, and retrieve an apple. The current issue is that they're stuck in a loop between the Laundromat and Canteen, repeatedly going west and east without making progress.

First, the goal is to open the gateway in the Canteen, then go north, west, south, etc., to reach the workshop and open the safe. But the user hasn't opened the gateway yet. The previous actions involved moving between the two locations without addressing the gateway. 

The user is in the Canteen again, but the gateway is still closed. The error message says they have to open the gateway first. So the next logical step is to try opening the gateway. However, the user might not have the right command for that. Maybe the correct action is to use a verb like "open" or "pull" the gateway. Since the gateway is closed, the user needs to find a way to open it. 

But in the previous attempt, the user tried "go north" but was told to open the gateway first. So the next step should be to attempt to open the gateway. The user might have been using "go" commands instead of interacting with the gateway directly. Therefore, the correct action is to try opening the gateway using the right command.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Shower location now. The goal is to navigate through the game, open the gateway, move north, west, south, etc., and retrieve the apple from the safe in the workshop.

Previously, they opened the gateway in the Canteen and went north to the Shower. Now, they need to continue following the steps. The next step according to the initial instructions was to go west after moving north. But in the current location (Shower), the unguarded exit is to the west. So the next action should be to go west. But wait, the user might be stuck again. Let me check the steps again.

The initial steps mentioned: after pulling open the gateway, go to the north, then attempt to travel north, then west, south, etc. So after opening the gateway and going north to the Shower, the next step is to go west. The user is in the Shower, so going west would be the next move. But the user might have already done that. Wait, the current location is Shower, and the previous action was going north from Canteen to Shower. Now, the next step is to go west from Shower. But the user might be in a loop again. However, the Shower's description says there's an unguarded exit to the west, so going west should be the correct next step. The user hasn't done that yet, so the next action is go west.

Ah, the workshop. This is some kind of workshop, really great standard vibes in this place, a wonderful standard atmosphere. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

There is an unguarded exit to the east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north.

Fancy seeing you here. Here, by the way, being the lounge. Let's see what's in here.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a couch. The couch is ordinary. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a mantelpiece. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The mantelpiece is typical. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You think about smashing the mantelpiece to bits, throwing the bits in the dump, etc, until you get bored. Look over there! a recliner! Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is an unguarded exit to the east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in the Lounge, and the goal is to retrieve the apple from the safe in the Workshop. The previous steps involved moving through various locations, opening the gateway, and reaching the Workshop. Now, in the Lounge, the user needs to find a way back to the Workshop to open the safe.

The current location is the Lounge, which has exits to the east, north, and south. The user needs to go back to the Workshop, which is to the west. But the previous action was going north from the Workshop, which led to the Lounge. The user might be stuck in a loop between the Workshop and Lounge. The next step should be to go south from the Lounge to return to the Workshop. However, the user might have already tried that. Alternatively, the user needs to find the safe in the Workshop and open it. But the Workshop was previously visited, and the safe was closed. The user might need to open the safe now. But the current location is the Lounge, so the correct path is to go back to the Workshop and then open the safe. The next action should be to go south from the Lounge to return to the Workshop.
