Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First thing I need you to do is to make an effort to travel south. If you can do that, attempt to go east. Then, retrieve the sandwich from the floor of the shower. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Lounge =-
Fancy seeing you here. Here, by the way, being the lounge. Let's see what's in here.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a bar. The bar is ordinary. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a couch. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The couch is typical. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You think about smashing the couch to bits, throwing the bits in the dump, etc, until you get bored. Look over there! a desk! Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is an unguarded exit to the east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

Ah, the workshop. This is some kind of workshop, really great standard vibes in this place, a wonderful standard atmosphere. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

You can see an opened safe. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You make out a stand. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Lounge and Workshop. The goal is to retrieve the sandwich from the shower. But so far, the assistant has just been going back and forth between south and north, which are the same rooms.

First, I need to recall the original task. The user had to travel south first, then east, then get the sandwich from the shower. But the current setup shows that the Lounge and Workshop are the only rooms, and there's no mention of a shower. Wait, maybe the shower is in another part of the map that's not shown yet. But according to the current room descriptions, there's no shower mentioned. The user might have missed something.

Wait, the initial instruction said to "retrieve the sandwich from the floor of the shower." But in the current rooms, there's no shower. Maybe the shower is in the Workshop or Lounge? But the descriptions don't mention it. Maybe the user needs to look for clues. The Lounge has a desk, but it's empty. The Workshop has an empty safe and stand. Maybe the sandwich is in one of these places, but the user hasn't checked properly.

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to find the shower through another exit. The current rooms have an exit to the east, but the user hasn't tried that. Wait, in the Lounge, there's an unguarded exit to the east. The Workshop also has an exit to the east. Maybe the east exit leads to the shower. But the user hasn't tried going east yet. The previous actions were only going south and north, which are the same rooms. So the user is stuck in a loop between Lounge and Workshop.

The next step should be to try going east from the Lounge, as per the initial instruction. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the assistant needs to tell the user to go east. But the user is repeating south and north, which isn't progressing. So the correct next action is to go east from the Lounge. The previous actions were going south (which loops back to Lounge) and north (which loops back to Workshop). So the user needs to try east instead.

-= Shower =-
You've just sauntered into a shower.



There is an open gateway leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

There is a sandwich on the floor.
