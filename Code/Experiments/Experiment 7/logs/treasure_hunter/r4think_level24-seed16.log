-= Workshop =-
You've just walked into a workshop.

Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a locker. You can make out an opened portmanteau. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You can make out a mantelpiece. The mantelpiece is standard. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

You've just sauntered into a cookery.

You scan the room for a chest, and you find a chest. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? Look over there! a platter. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You can make out a saucepan. The saucepan is typical. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north.

Hey, want to see a fridge? Look over there, a fridge. The fridge is empty, what a horrible day! You can make out a bowl. The bowl is typical. The bowl appears to be empty. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

-= Cellar =-
You are in an usual kind of place. That is to say, you're in a cellar. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a rack. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing hasn't got anything on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the rack. You can make out a workbench. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Hm. Oh well

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a TextWorld game and needs to follow specific steps to win. The goal is to lift the stick of butter from the kitchenette floor. 

First, I need to recall the initial instructions. The user was told to go west, then take a trip west, venture north, take a trip north, go east, then move north again, venture west, and finally lift the butter.

Looking at the current location, the user is in the Cellar. The previous moves were: Workshop > Garage > Cookery > Scullery > Cellar. The next step according to the initial plan was to go east from the Cellar. But the user hasn't done that yet. 

Wait, the user's last action was "go north" from the Scullery to the Cellar. Now, in the Cellar, the exits are east (unguarded), north (unblocked), and south (unblocked). The next step according to the initial plan was to go east. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next step should be to go east from the Cellar. 

But the user might be in a loop if they keep moving between rooms without progress. However, the initial plan specifies going east from the Cellar. So the next action should be "go east" to proceed towards the kitchenette. 

I need to make sure that the user isn't repeating the same action. Since they've already moved north multiple times, going east now is the next logical step. The goal is to reach the kitchenette where the butter is. So the correct next command is "go east".
</think>go east

-= Office =-
You find yourself in an office. A typical kind of place.

A closed coffer is right there by you.

There is an open door leading east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.



>                                                                                                                                -= Office =-0/6

-= Pantry =-
You arrive in a pantry. A standard kind of place.

You scan the room for a stand, and you find a stand. The stand is typical. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.

There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

-= Canteen =-
You are in a canteen. An usual kind of place.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a shelf. But there isn't a thing on it.

There is an unguarded exit to the east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.



>                                                                                                                                -= Canteen =-0/8

-= Kitchenette =-
Well, here we are in a kitchenette.

You can make out a locked cabinet close by.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

There is a stick of butter on the floor.


>                                                                                                                                -= Kitchenette =-0/9

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Kitchenette and there's a stick of butter on the floor. The goal is to lift it. The previous steps led them here, so the next logical step is to pick up the butter.

First, the goal is to take the stick of butter from the floor. The user has already navigated through various rooms to get here. The current room is Kitchenette, and the butter is present. So the next action should be to take the butter.

I need to check if there's any loop. The user has been moving between rooms, but now they're in the correct room with the item. No loops here, so the action is straightforward. The command should be "take stick of butter".
