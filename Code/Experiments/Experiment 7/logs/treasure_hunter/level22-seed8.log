THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out how to win this game. The user mentioned retrieving a spork from the cookery in the dish-pit. Let me recap the steps taken so far.

Starting in the dish-pit, the player went west to the basement, then west again to the cubicle, then east to the study, south back to the cubicle, then north to the workshop, and back south to the workshop again. It seems like there's a loop between the cubicle and workshop. The goal is to get the spork from the cookery in the dish-pit. 

Wait, the initial instruction said to go west from the dish-pit, then west again, then west once more? Or maybe the first move was west, then west again, then south? Let me check the history. 

First action: go west from dish-pit to basement. Then go west again to cubicle. Then east to study, then south back to cubicle. Then north to workshop, then south back to cubicle. So the player is stuck in a loop between cubicle and workshop. The spork is in the dish-pit, but the player hasn't gone back to the dish-pit yet. 

Wait, the initial steps were: dish-pit -> basement -> cubicle -> study -> cubicle -> workshop -> cubicle. So the player hasn't returned to the dish-pit. The spork is in the dish-pit's cookery. So maybe the player needs to find a way back to the dish-pit. But the current location is cubicle. The cubicle has an open portal west, which might lead back to the basement, then north to dish-pit? Let me check the cubicle's description. 

In the cubicle, there's an open portal west. So from cubicle, go west to basement. Then from basement, go north to dish-pit. Then in the dish-pit, retrieve the spork. But the player is currently in cubicle, so the next step should be go west to basement, then north to dish-pit. But the user's last action was go south from workshop to cubicle. So the next step is to go west from cubicle to basement, then north to dish-pit. But the user is in cubicle, so the next command should be go west. However, the user is in a loop between cubicle and workshop. So maybe the player needs to find another way. Alternatively, maybe there's a different path. 

Wait, in the study, there's a closed toolbox. Maybe the player needs to open it? But the study's description says the toolbox is closed. However, the user hasn't interacted with it yet. But the goal is to get the spork from the cookery in the dish-pit. So perhaps the player needs to go back to the dish-pit. The problem is that the player is stuck in a loop between cubicle and workshop. So the next step is to go west from cubicle to basement, then north to dish-pit. But the user's last action was go south to cubicle, so the next action should be go west from cubicle. But the user has already done that before. Wait, the user is in cubicle again, so go west to basement, then north to dish-pit. Then in dish-pit, retrieve the spork. So the next action is go west from cubicle to basement. But the user is in cubicle, so the command is go west. However, the user might be repeating the same steps, leading to a loop. So maybe the player needs to find another way. Alternatively, maybe the player needs to check the locked bureau in the workshop. But the goal is to get the spork, not the bureau. 

So the correct path is to go back to dish-pit, retrieve the spork, and then exit. But the player is stuck in a loop. Therefore, the next action is to go west from cubicle to basement, then north to dish-pit. So the next command is go west.
