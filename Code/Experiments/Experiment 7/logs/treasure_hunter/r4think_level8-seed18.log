Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, make an attempt to take a trip west. And then, travel south. Once you manage that, try to go east. Following that, recover the latchkey from the floor of the studio. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Cubicle =-
You arrive in a cubicle. An ordinary one.



There is an unguarded exit to the west.

There is a key on the floor.

-= Study =-
You've just walked into a study.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Workshop =-
You find yourself in a workshop.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the north.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let me try to figure out what I need to do here. The user wants me to navigate through different rooms and retrieve the latchkey from the studio. Let me recap the steps I've taken so far.

First, I started in the Cubicle, went west to the Study, then south to the Workshop. Now I'm in the Workshop. The next step according to the initial instructions was to go east, but the user mentioned that after going west, south, then east, I need to get the latchkey from the studio. Wait, the studio might be a different room. Let me check the current location.

In the Workshop, there's an exit to the east and north. The user said to go east next. But maybe the studio is in a different direction. Wait, the initial steps were: go west, then south, then east. So after the Workshop, going east would take me to the next room. But the goal is to get the latchkey from the studio. So maybe after going east from the Workshop, I'll reach the studio. Then I can pick up the key. But in the Workshop, the description says there's an unguarded exit to the north. Wait, maybe I need to check if the studio is in the north or east direction. Let me think.

Wait, the initial steps were: go west (from Cubicle to Study), then south (from Study to Workshop). Now in the Workshop, the next step was supposed to be east. But the user's instruction says after going west, south, then east, then get the key. So from the Workshop, going east would take me to the next room. Let me check the current room's description again. The Workshop has an exit to the east and north. So if I go east, maybe that's the studio. Then, once there, I can pick up the key. But the user mentioned the key is on the floor of the studio. So maybe after going east from the Workshop, I reach the studio, pick up the key, and then return. But the user said to stop after that. So the next action should be to go east from the Workshop. But the user's last input was in the Workshop, and the assistant's previous action was "go south" leading to the Workshop. Now, the next step is to go east. But the user's instruction says after going west, south, then east, then get the key. So the next action is to go east from the Workshop. However, the user's current location is the Workshop, and the next step is to go east. But the user's last message shows that the assistant is in the Workshop and needs to proceed. So the correct next action is to go east. But maybe the studio is in the north? Wait, the initial steps were to go west, then south, then east. So after the Workshop, going east would be the next step. So the next action is "go east".

-= Studio =-
Well I'll be, you are in a place we're calling a studio. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

There is a latchkey on the floor.
