Welcome to TextWorld! Here is how to play! First stop, make an attempt to move south. Then, make an effort to head west. With that over with, retrieve the fondue from the floor of the studio. Alright, thanks!

-= Cubicle =-
You find yourself in a cubicle. An ordinary kind of place.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

-= Steam Room =-
You arrive in a steam room. An usual kind of place. You begin looking for stuff.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

There is a cashew on the floor.

-= Studio =-
A rusty sign tells you that you are now in the studio. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

There is a fondue on the floor.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to win this game. The user mentioned that the goal is to retrieve the fondue from the studio. So first, I need to make sure I'm in the Studio. Looking back at the previous steps, the user went south from the cubicle, then west into the steam room, and then west again to the studio. Wait, no, the steam room's west exit led to the studio. So now they're in the studio.

In the studio, there's a fondue on the floor. The goal is to get it. But the user has to move to the studio, which they have already done. The next step would be to pick up the fondue. But the problem is, the game might require moving to a specific location where the fondue is, but the description says the fondue is on the floor of the studio. So maybe once in the studio, the player just needs to take the fondue. However, in TextWorld, sometimes you have to use a command like 'take fondue' or 'get fondue' to pick it up. But the user's previous actions were moving directions. The last message from the game says "There is a fondue on the floor." So the next step is to take the fondue. But the user hasn't done that yet. Wait, the user's last action was 'go west' to the studio. Now, they need to take the fondue. But the game might require that action. However, the user's previous steps were moving, so maybe the next step is to take the fondue. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the answer should be to take the fondue. But the user's last action was moving to the studio, so the next command should be 'take fondue' or 'get fondue'. However, the game's previous responses didn't use those commands, so maybe the correct action is to take it. Alternatively, maybe the game expects the player to just be in the studio and the fondue is already obtained. But the user hasn't picked it up yet. So the correct next step is to take the fondue.
