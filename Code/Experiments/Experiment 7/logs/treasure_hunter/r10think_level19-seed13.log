Welcome to TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, take a trip west. After that, travel south. With that over with, make an effort to venture west. And then, move south. Then, move south. With that done, go east. Once you manage that, make an attempt to go north. That done, venture east. And then, recover the passkey from the floor of the bar. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to proceed. The user's goal is to recover the passkey from the floor of the bar. So far, the journey has taken them through several rooms: Kitchen, Cookhouse, Studio, Scullery, Chamber, Laundromat, back to Studio, Scullery, Attic, and back to Scullery. The challenge is to find the passkey, which is mentioned as being on the floor of the bar.

Looking at the current location, they're in the Scullery again. The previous steps involved moving west, south, east, north, etc., but they've looped between Scullery and Attic. The passkey isn't in the Scullery or Attic, so maybe they need to check other rooms. The bar isn't mentioned in the current rooms, so perhaps they need to find a way to reach the bar. Alternatively, maybe the passkey is in a different location that hasn't been explored yet. Since the user has to go east, south, west, etc., but got stuck in a loop, maybe they need to try a different direction or look for objects that can help them proceed. The locked toolbox in the Studio might be a clue, but they need the key. Alternatively, maybe the passkey is in the Chamber or another room. The user needs to find a way to get to the bar and retrieve the passkey. Since the current path is looping, perhaps trying a different action like checking the fridge or the case in the Scullery might be necessary. But the fridge is empty. Maybe the case has something. Alternatively, the user might need to go north from the Scullery again, but that leads to the Attic. Wait, the user is in the Scullery again, and the previous steps showed that going north from Scullery leads to the Attic, which then leads back. So maybe the passkey is in the Chamber or another room that's been missed. The user needs to find the bar, which might be in a different part of the map. Alternatively, maybe the passkey is in the Chamber, but the user hasn't checked there. The Chamber had a sandwich on the floor. Maybe the passkey is in the Studio's locked toolbox or bureau. But to open them, the user needs a key. Alternatively, maybe the passkey is in the bar, which is not yet visited. The user needs to find the bar and retrieve the passkey. Since the current path is looping, the next step might be to try a different direction or check for objects that can help proceed. The user might need to go east from the Scullery again, but that's unguarded. Wait, in the Scullery, the user can go east, north, or south. Going east from Scullery leads to the Laundromat, then north to Studio, which was already visited. Maybe the user needs to check the Laundromat for something. But the Laundromat's bench is empty. Alternatively, the user might need to go south from Scullery again, but that's the same as before. Maybe the user needs to find a way to get to the bar through a different route. Since the user's goal is to get to the bar and retrieve the passkey, the next step is to find the bar and check the floor. But how? The user might need to continue exploring other rooms. The next action could be to go east from Scullery to Laundromat, then north to Studio, then east again, but that's blocked. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check the case in the Scullery for something. The case might have the passkey. But the user hasn't checked it yet. So the next step is to check the case in the Scullery.

<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to recover the passkey from the floor of the bar. So far, they've been moving between rooms, but they've looped between Scullery, Attic, and Studio. The passkey isn't in any of these places yet. The key is in the bar, which hasn't been visited. The user needs to find the bar and check the floor there.

Looking at the current location, they're in the Scullery again. The previous actions have been going back and forth between Scullery and Attic, which isn't helping. The case in the Scullery is too strong to open, and the fridge is empty. The locked toolbox in the Studio might be a clue, but they need a key. Maybe the passkey is in the Studio's bureau or toolbox, but they can't open them without a key. Alternatively, the passkey might be in the Chamber or another room they've passed but didn't check thoroughly.

Wait, the user mentioned the passkey is on the floor of the bar. So they need to reach the bar. The current path doesn't lead to the bar. Maybe they need to find another exit or check other rooms for a way to get to the bar. The user has to break the loop by trying a different action. Instead of repeating west and east, maybe they need to check the case again or look for a different object. But the case is too strong. Alternatively, maybe the passkey is in the Studio's locked toolbox, and they need to find a key to open it. But where would they get the key? Maybe from the bar, but they haven't reached it yet.

The next step should be to find the bar. Since the current path isn't leading there, perhaps the user needs to check the Laundromat or another room for a way to get to the bar. But the Laundromat was visited earlier and didn't have anything. Maybe the user needs to go north from the Studio to the next room, but that's blocked. Alternatively, they need to find a different path. The key is to break the loop and find the bar. The next action should be to go east from the Scullery again, but that's already been tried. Maybe the user needs to check the case again, even though it's strong. Alternatively, maybe the passkey is in the Studio's bureau, and they need to open it. But how? They need a key, which might be in the bar. This is a bit of a dead end. The user needs to find a way to get to the bar and retrieve the passkey. Since the current path isn't working, the next action should be to go east from the Scullery again, even though it's a loop, but maybe that's the only way to proceed.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user's goal is to recover the passkey from the floor of the bar. So far, they've been moving between Scullery, Attic, and Studio, looping back and forth. The passkey isn't in any of these places yet. The key is in the bar, which hasn't been visited. The user needs to find the bar and check the floor there.

Looking at the current location, they're in the Scullery again. The previous actions have been going back and forth between Scullery and Attic, which isn't helping. The case in the Scullery is too strong to open, and the fridge is empty. The locked toolbox in the Studio might be a clue, but they need a key. Maybe the passkey is in the Studio's bureau or toolbox, but they can't open them without a key. Alternatively, the passkey might be in the Chamber or another room they've passed but didn't check thoroughly.

Wait, the user mentioned the passkey is on the floor of the bar. So they need to reach the bar. The current path doesn't lead to the bar. Maybe they need to find another exit or check other rooms for a way to get to the bar. The user has to break the loop by trying a different action. Instead of repeating west and east, maybe they need to check the case again or look for a different object. But the case is too strong. Alternatively, maybe the passkey is in the Studio's bureau, and they need to open it. But how? They need a key, which might be in the bar. This is a bit of a dead end. The user needs to find a way to get to the bar and retrieve the passkey. Since the current path isn't working, the next action should be to go east from the Scullery again, even though it's a loop, but maybe that's the only way to proceed.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between Scullery, Attic, and Studio. The goal is to find the passkey in the bar. So far, they've checked the case in Scullery, the trunk in Attic, and the locked toolbox in Studio. None of these have yielded the passkey. The key is in the bar, which hasn't been visited yet. The user needs to find a way to get to the bar. Since the current path isn't working, they need to try a different approach. Maybe check the bureau in the Studio for something. Alternatively, look for a different exit or object that can lead to the bar. The next step should be to check the closed bureau in the Studio, even though it's locked. Maybe the key is there or leads to the bar. Alternatively, try going east from Scullery again, but that's been done. The user needs to break the loop by exploring other options.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between Scullery, Attic, and Studio. The goal is to find the passkey in the bar. So far, they've checked the case, trunk, and toolbox but nothing. The key is in the bar, which hasn't been visited. The user needs to find a way to get to the bar. Since the current path isn't working, they need to try a different approach. Maybe check the bureau in the Studio for something. Alternatively, look for a different exit or object that can lead to the bar. The next step should be to check the closed bureau in the Studio, even though it's locked. Maybe the key is there or leads to the bar. Alternatively, try going east from Scullery again, but that's been done. The user needs to break the loop by exploring other options.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between Scullery, Attic, and Studio. The goal is to find the passkey in the bar. So far, they've checked the case, trunk, and toolbox but nothing. The key is in the bar, which hasn't been visited. The user needs to find a way to get to the bar. Since the current path isn't working, they need to try a different approach. Maybe check the bureau in the Studio for something. Alternatively, look for a different exit or object that can lead to the bar. The next step should be to check the closed bureau in the Studio, even though it's locked. Maybe the key is there or leads to the bar. Alternatively, try going east from Scullery again, but that's been done. The user needs to break the loop by exploring other options.
