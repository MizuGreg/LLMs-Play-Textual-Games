It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, make an attempt to go to the south. After that, attempt to go east. That done, go south. With that accomplished, lift the bug from the floor of the closet. Alright, thanks!

-= Workshop =-
You are in a workshop. An ordinary one. You can barely contain your excitement.



There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

>                                                                                                                                -= Workshop =-0/1
AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go south
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Cookhouse =-
You find yourself in a cookhouse. A standard kind of place. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the north.

AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go east
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Vault =-
You find yourself in a vault. A normal one.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the south. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.



>                                                                                                                                -= Vault =-0/3
AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go south

-= Closet =-
You've entered a closet. Let's see what's in here.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a durian and a bug on the floor.


>                                                                                                                                -= Closet =-0/4

That's not a verb I recognise.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to complete a text-based game where they have to follow specific steps. The goal is to lift the bug from the closet. So far, they've moved through the workshop, cookhouse, vault, and into the closet. In the closet, they tried to lift the bug but got an error because "lift the bug" isn't recognized. The correct command should be "lift bug" without the article.

First, I need to confirm the goal again: lift the bug from the closet. The user has already entered the closet, so the next step is to use the correct verb. Since "lift the bug" isn't working, maybe the game expects just "lift bug" or "pick up bug". The error message says "That's not a verb I recognise," so perhaps the game is looking for a verb without the article. 

The user's previous attempt was "lift the bug from the floor of the closet." The game might not accept the prepositional phrase. So the correct command is likely "lift bug" or "pick up bug". Since the user tried "lift the bug" and it didn't work, the next step is to try "lift bug" without the article. 

So the next action should be "lift bug".
