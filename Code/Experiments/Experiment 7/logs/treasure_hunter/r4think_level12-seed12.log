Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is how to play! First off, make an effort to take a trip south. And then, go to the west. After that, retrieve the fly larva from the floor of the cookhouse. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Study =-
Of every study you could have walked into, you had to come round an usual one. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You see a locked coffer. You make out a trunk. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You scan the room for a stand, and you find a stand. The stand is typical. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is an open gateway leading east. There is an open gate leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

-= Vault =-
You make a grand eccentric entrance into a vault. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You see a suitcase. You make out a counter. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the counter.

You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out what's going on here. The user is in a text-based game where they have to navigate through different rooms and collect items. The goal mentioned is to retrieve the fly larva from the cookhouse and then stop. 

Looking at the history, the user has been moving between the Study and Vault rooms. They started by going south from the Study, which took them to the Vault. Then they went north back to the Study, and this cycle continues. The problem is that they're stuck in a loop between these two rooms without making progress towards the goal.

The current room is the Vault again, and the user is told to list what's there. The Vault has a suitcase and a counter, but nothing on the counter. The exits are north and west. The Study room has a locked coffer, a trunk, a stand, and exits east and west. The user needs to get to the cookhouse, find the fly larva, and then stop.

So, the next step should be to find a way to get to the cookhouse. The user has been moving between Study and Vault, but maybe they need to go west from the Vault. The Vault has an unguarded exit to the west, which might lead to another area. If they go west from the Vault, they might reach the cookhouse. Then, once there, they can look for the fly larva on the floor.

But in the previous steps, the user kept going south and north, which is why they're stuck. The key is to go west from the Vault instead of north. That's the next action needed to break the loop and move towards the cookhouse.

-= Cookhouse =-
You're now in the cookhouse.

You can make out a locked case, which looks usual, in the room.

There is an open portal leading north. There is an open hatch leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a fly larva on the floor.
