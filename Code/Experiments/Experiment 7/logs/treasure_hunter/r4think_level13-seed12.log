Welcome to TextWorld! Your first objective is to make an effort to take a trip west. And then, go to the south. After that, head west. With that accomplished, lift the fly larva from the floor of the cookhouse. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Cubicle =-
Well, here we are in a cubicle. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.



There is an open door leading south. There is an open gateway leading west.

-= Study =-
Of every study you could have walked into, you had to come round an usual one. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You see a locked coffer. You make out a trunk. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You scan the room for a stand, and you find a stand. The stand is typical. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is an open gateway leading east. There is an open gate leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

-= Launderette =-
You arrive in a launderette. A typical kind of place.

You can see a bench. The bench is ordinary. However, the bench, like an empty bench, has nothing on it.

There is an open gate leading east. There is an open portal leading south. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this. The user is in a text-based game where they need to follow specific steps. The goal is to first go west, then south, then west again, lift the fly larva from the cookhouse, and then stop.

Looking at the current environment, the user is in the Launderette. The previous steps were going west from the Cubicle to the Study, then west again to the Launderette. Now, the available exits are east, south, and west. The user needs to go south next, as per the initial plan. But the user's last action was "go west" again, which might be leading them in a loop. Wait, the user's current location is the Launderette. The directions here are east, south, and west. The original plan was after going west from the Study, then south, then west. But in the Launderette, going west would take them back to the Study? Or maybe not. Let me check the previous steps again.

The first move was from Cubicle (west) to Study (west). Then from Study (west) to Launderette (west). Now, in the Launderette, the exits are east, south, and west. The user needs to go south next. But the user's last action was "go west" again, which might be a loop. Wait, the user's goal is to go west, then south, then west. So after the Launderette, going south would be the next step. But the user is in the Launderette, and the exit south is available. So the next step should be to go south. However, the user might be stuck in a loop if they keep going west. But in the Launderette, going west would take them back to the Study? Or maybe the Study is to the west of the Launderette? Let me think. The Study's exits were east and west, and the Launderette's exits are east, south, and west. So maybe the Study is to the west of the Launderette. So if the user is in the Launderette and goes west, they go back to the Study. But the user's plan is to go west, then south, then west. So after the Study, they need to go south. But in the Study, the exit south is blocked? Wait, in the Study description, it says "You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south." So maybe the Study's south exit is unblocked. So the user was in the Study, went south to the Launderette. Now, in the Launderette, they need to go south again? Wait, no. The original plan was: first go west (from Cubicle to Study), then go south (from Study to Launderette), then go west (from Launderette to where? Maybe back to Study? But that would be a loop. Hmm, maybe the user needs to go south from the Launderette to another room. Wait, the Launderette's south exit leads to another room. The user's goal is to lift the fly larva in the cookhouse. So maybe after going south from the Launderette, they reach the cookhouse. But the user hasn't reached the cookhouse yet. Let me check the initial instructions again. The user needs to go west, then south, then west. So after the first west (Cubicle to Study), then south (Study to Launderette), then west (Launderette to ... maybe the cookhouse? Or another room). Wait, maybe the user is in the Launderette, and going west would take them to the Study again, which would be a loop. Therefore, the next step should be to go south from the Launderette. But the user's previous action was "go west", which might be causing a loop. So the user needs to go south instead. The user's next action should be "go south" to proceed towards the cookhouse. But the user's last action was "go west", which might be the loop. Therefore, the correct next step is to go south.

-= Cookhouse =-
You're now in the cookhouse.

You can make out a locked case, which looks usual, in the room.

There is an open portal leading north. There is an open hatch leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a fly larva on the floor.

That's not a verb I recognise.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in the Cookhouse and needs to lift the fly larva from the floor. The previous attempt to "lift fly larva" was rejected. So, what's the correct verb here? Maybe "pick up" or "take"?

Looking at the game's previous interactions, the user was told to "lift the fly larva from the floor of the cookhouse." The system didn't accept "lift," so perhaps the correct command is "take" or "pick up." 

The user's goal is to follow the steps: go west, then south, then west again, then lift the larva. So far, they've gone west (Cubicle to Study), then south (Study to Launderette), then west (Launderette to Cookhouse). Now, they need to lift the larva. Since "lift" didn't work, maybe "take" is the right verb. 

The next step is to use "take fly larva" instead of "lift." That should complete the task. The user needs to make sure they use the correct command. So the answer is "take fly larva."
</think>take fly larva
