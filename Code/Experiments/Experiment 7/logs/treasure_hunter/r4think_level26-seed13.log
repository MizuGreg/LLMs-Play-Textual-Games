Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an profound round of TextWorld? You do! Here is how to play! First of all, move east. Once you accomplish that, try to head east. That done, head north. Okay, and then, make an attempt to go to the west. Once you finish that, travel west. If you can get through with that, make an attempt to go west. If you can finish that, try to go west. After that, make an attempt to venture south. And then, travel east. Then, make an effort to move south. If you can do that, go south. With that over with, recover the keycard from the floor of the bar. Got that? Good!

FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a TextWorld game and needs to navigate through different rooms to recover a keycard from the bar. The goal is to follow the sequence of directions given: move east, then east again, north, west, west, west, south, east, south, and finally south again. Then, recover the keycard from the bar's floor.

Looking at the current room, the user is in the Washroom. The previous actions were: go east (Shower → Salon → Bedroom → Cookery → Washroom). The next steps according to the initial instructions are to go west again, but the user has already been told to try going west from the Washroom. However, the user might be stuck in a loop if they keep going back and forth between rooms without making progress toward the keycard.

The user needs to check if they're in a loop. The current room is Washroom, and the exits are east, south, and west. The previous steps have been moving east, then east again, then north, then west, then west, then west. Wait, the initial instructions said after going west three times, then south, east, south, etc. But the user might have already done some of those steps. However, in the current state, they are in the Washroom, and the next step according to the initial plan would be to go south to the bar. But the user might be stuck in a loop between the Washroom and other rooms.

Wait, the user's last action was go west from the Washroom. The Washroom's exits are east, south, and west. The user needs to go south to reach the bar. But the initial instructions mention going south after certain steps. So maybe the next step is to go south from the Washroom to the bar, then retrieve the keycard. However, the user might have already done that. Alternatively, if they're in a loop, they need to find a different path. But according to the current room, the user can go south, which is unguarded. So the next action should be to go south to the bar and pick up the keycard.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in TextWorld to recover a keycard from the bar. The initial instructions were a series of directional moves: east, east, north, west, west, west, south, east, south, south. But the user seems to be looping between rooms, especially the Salon and Washroom.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Bedroom. The previous actions led them back to the Salon, then to the Washroom, and back to the Salon again. The keycard is supposed to be in the bar, which is probably accessible via the south exit from the Bedroom. But the user might be stuck in a loop between the Salon and Washroom because they're not moving south from the Bedroom.

The goal is to get to the bar and retrieve the keycard. The next logical step after the Bedroom is to go south through the open portal. The user has been going back and forth between Salon and Washroom, which doesn't progress toward the bar. So the next action should be to go south from the Bedroom to reach the bar and pick up the keycard. Repeating the same actions isn't working, so changing the direction to south is necessary.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a TextWorld game trying to navigate through various rooms to recover a keycard from the bar. The initial instructions were a series of directional moves, but the user has been looping between rooms without reaching the bar.

Current room is the Chamber. The previous actions led them from the Laundromat to the Chamber. The goal is to get to the bar and retrieve the keycard. The user needs to find the correct path without getting stuck in loops. The next step should be to go east from the Chamber, as that's the only exit mentioned. But wait, the user might be missing the correct path. Alternatively, maybe they need to go back north from the Chamber to reach the bar. However, the initial plan was to go south from the Bedroom, but that led to the Kitchenette and then Laundromat. Maybe the correct path is to go east from the Chamber to reach the bar. But the user needs to check if that's the right direction. Since the user is in the Chamber, the next action should be to go east to proceed towards the bar and pick up the keycard.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Laundromat and Chamber. They keep going back and forth between these two rooms. The goal is to reach the bar and get the keycard. The initial plan was to follow specific directions, but they've been repeating the same steps.

First, the goal is to recover the keycard from the bar. The user needs to find the correct path without looping. They've been going west and east between Laundromat and Chamber, which isn't getting them closer to the bar.

Second, the past actions have led them in a cycle. The next step should be to find another exit or direction that leads towards the bar. The Laundromat has a north gate, so maybe going north from there would help. But the user has been going west instead.

Third, since repeating the same actions isn't working, they need to try a different direction. The Laundromat's north gate is unblocked, so going north might be the way to go instead of west. That's the synonym for the previous action, breaking the loop.

Okay, let's tackle this. The user is in a loop between Laundromat and Kitchenette. The goal is to get to the bar and get the keycard. Previous actions have been going back and forth, so need to break the loop.

First, the goal is to reach the bar and retrieve the keycard. The user needs to find the correct path without looping.

Second, the past actions have led them in a cycle. The next step should be to go north from Laundromat, which was previously tried but maybe missed the correct path. Alternatively, check if there's another exit.

Third, since going west and east isn't working, trying north might be the key. The Laundromat has a north gate, so going north could lead to the bar. That's a different action than before, breaking the loop.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

There is an open gate leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

-= Laundromat =-
You are in a typical kind of place. That is to say, you're in a laundromat.

You see a locked cabinet. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a counter. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the counter.

There is an open gate leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.
