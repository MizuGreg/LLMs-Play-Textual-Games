It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! First thing I need you to do is to go to the north. And then, go to the east. After that, go north. And then, venture west. And then, take a trip north. If you can manage that, make an effort to head east. Then, make an attempt to venture east. Then, venture south. With that accomplished, take a trip south. Next, travel east. If you can finish that, recover the frisbee from the floor of the closet. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Salon =-
You arrive in a salon. A standard one.

Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a portmanteau. A closed dresser, which looks typical, is right there by you. You can make out a desk. The desk appears to be empty. Hm. Oh well

There is an open hatch leading north. There is an open passageway leading south.

You've entered a cubicle. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."



There is an open hatch leading south. There is an unblocked exit to the east. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north.

There is a passkey on the floor.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user wants me to navigate through the TextWorld game following a specific sequence of directions and eventually retrieve the frisbee from the closet. Let me start by recalling the initial steps.

First, the user was in the Salon, then went north to the Cubicle. The current location is the Cubicle. The goal is to go north, east, north, west, north, east, east, south, south, east, then get the frisbee.

Looking at the current environment in the Cubicle: there's an open hatch south, an unblocked exit east, and a passkey on the floor. The prompt mentions that the user should try going north. But the user's previous action was "go north" from the Salon to the Cubicle. Now, in the Cubicle, the next step in the sequence is to go east. However, the user is at the Cubicle, and the next step according to the initial instructions is to go east. But the user's last action was going north, so maybe the next step is east.

Wait, the initial instructions say: go north, then east, then north, then west, then north, then east, then east, then south, then south, then east. So after the first north (to Cubicle), the next is east. But in the Cubicle, there's an unblocked exit to the east. So the next action should be "go east". However, the user might be in a loop if they keep going back and forth. But in this case, the Cubicle has a passkey on the floor. Maybe the passkey is needed to proceed further. But the initial instructions don't mention using the passkey, so perhaps it's a red herring. The user needs to follow the direction sequence.

So the next step after arriving in the Cubicle is to go east. The user's previous action was going north, so the next step is east. The user hasn't done that yet. So the next command should be "go east".

-= Shower =-
Well, here we are in a shower. You begin looking for stuff.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in TextWorld according to the given steps. The goal is to follow a specific sequence of directions and eventually retrieve the frisbee from the closet.

First, the initial steps were to go north, then east, then north again, west, north, east, east, south, south, east, and finally get the frisbee. But the user is currently in the Shower room. Let me track their movement so far.

Starting from the Salon, they went north to the Cubicle, then east to the Shower. Now, the next step in the original plan was to go north from the Shower. But the user's last action was going east, which might have led them to the Shower. The current room is the Shower, and the available exits are north, west, and east. The original plan after the Shower would be to go north again. However, the user might be getting stuck in a loop if they keep moving between rooms without making progress towards the closet.

Looking at the rooms: Salon → Cubicle → Shower. The next step should be north from the Shower. But the user might have already done that. Wait, the original steps after the Shower would be to go north again. But the user's next action should be to go north from the Shower. However, the user might have already done that, leading to a loop. Alternatively, maybe they need to check for the frisbee in the closet, but the closet isn't mentioned yet. Wait, the original plan says after traveling east, south, south, east, then recover the frisbee from the closet. So perhaps the user needs to navigate to the closet area.

But in the current room (Shower), the exits are north, west, east. The original plan after the Shower is to go north again. Let me check the original steps again. The user's plan was: go north, east, north, west, north, east, east, south, south, east, then get the frisbee. So after the Shower, the next step is north. But the user is in the Shower, so going north would take them to the next room. However, the user might have already done that, leading to a loop. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west from the Shower to reach the Cubicle again, but that's not part of the original plan. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east again from the Shower to reach another room. But the original plan after the Shower is to go north. So the next action should be go north. However, the user might be stuck in a loop between rooms. Therefore, the correct next step is to go north from the Shower.

You've just shown up in a parlor.



There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an unblocked exit to the north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in TextWorld following a specific path. The goal is to eventually retrieve the frisbee from the closet and win the game.

First, I need to recall the initial instructions: go north, then east, north again, west, north, east, east again, south, south, east, then get the frisbee. But the user is currently in the Parlor room. Let me check the current position.

The user has been moving through rooms: Salon → Cubicle → Shower → Parlor. The next steps in the original plan were after the first few moves. But the user is now in the Parlor, and the directions here are east, north, south, west. The prompt says to go south, but the user might be stuck in a loop.

Looking at the previous steps, the user went north from Salon, then east from Cubicle, north from Shower, and now in Parlor. The next step in the original plan was to go south from Parlor. But the user might be repeating actions without progress. The key is to follow the exact path given, but also check for possible loops.

In the Parlor, the available exits are east, north, south, west. The original plan after Parlor would be to go south, then south again, then east. But the user needs to make sure they're not looping. Since the user is in Parlor, the next step according to the original plan is to go south. However, the user might have already done that. Wait, the user's previous action was "go north" from the Shower to Parlor. Now, in Parlor, the next step should be south as per the original plan. But the user might be in a loop if they keep going back and forth. However, the instructions say to follow the exact steps: after Parlor, go south, then south again, then east. So the next action should be south.

Okay, let's try to figure out the best way to proceed here. The user is in a TextWorld game and needs to follow a specific sequence of directions to reach the frisbee in the closet and win. Let me break down the steps they need to take.

First, the initial instructions were: go north, then east, then north again, west, north, east, east, south, south, east, then retrieve the frisbee. But the user has been moving through different rooms like the salon, cubicle, shower, and parlor. Now they're back in the shower room again, which might be part of the loop.

Looking at the current position in the shower room, the available exits are east, north, and west. The user has already been moving between these rooms, possibly getting stuck in a loop. The key is to track which steps of the goal have been completed and which are left.

The user's past actions include going north from the salon to the cubicle, then east to the shower, north to the parlor, south back to the shower. Now, they need to continue following the original path. The next step in the original plan after the shower was to go north again, but that might not be the case here. Alternatively, maybe they need to go east from the shower to proceed further.

But the user's goal is to eventually reach the closet's floor to get the frisbee. So, perhaps the correct path is to keep moving east from the shower to reach the next room, then continue following the directions. However, the user might be repeating the same actions, leading to a loop. Therefore, changing the direction slightly, like going east instead of north or west, might help break the loop and progress towards the goal.

In the current shower room, the user has the option to go east. The original plan had going east after some steps, so maybe that's the right move here. The next action should be to go east to proceed further in the game.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in TextWorld, following a specific sequence of directions to eventually find a frisbee and win. The current room is the Cookery, and the user has just arrived here after moving east from the Shower.

First, I need to recall the original goal. The user was instructed to go north, then east, then north again, west, north, east, east, south, south, east, and finally retrieve the frisbee from the closet. So far, the user has moved through Salon → Cubicle → Shower → Parlor → Shower again → Cookery. 

Looking at the current room (Cookery), the available exits are north, east, south, and west. The previous steps had the user moving east, then north, then east, then south, then east again. Now, in the Cookery, the next step according to the original plan would be to go north again. However, the user might be stuck in a loop if they keep moving between rooms without making progress towards the closet.

But wait, the user's last action was going east from the Shower to the Cookery. The next step in the original plan was to go south, but the user is now in the Cookery. The original plan after the Parlor was to go south to the Shower again, then east to the Cookery. Now, the user needs to continue following the sequence: after Cookery, the next step would be to go north, then east, then south, then east again, and finally find the frisbee.

However, the user might be repeating paths, so I need to check if there's a different approach. The key is to ensure that each movement is part of the sequence without getting stuck. The user is in the Cookery, and the next step according to the original plan is to go north. But the user might have already done that. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east again from the Cookery to proceed further.

Wait, the original plan after the Parlor was to go south to the Shower, then east to the Cookery. Now, in the Cookery, the next step would be to go north again, as per the original sequence. But the user might be looping between rooms. However, the user's last action was moving east to the Cookery, so the next step should be north. Let me confirm the original steps again:

Original steps:
1. Go north (from Salon to Cubicle)
2. Go east (Cubicle to Shower)
3. Go north (Shower to Parlor)
4. Go south (Parlor to Shower)
5. Go east (Shower to Cookery)
6. Go north (Cookery to next room)
7. Go east (then south, then east again)
8. Finally, find the frisbee.

So in the Cookery, the next step is to go north. However, the user might be in a loop if they keep moving between rooms without progressing. But according to the original plan, after Cookery, the next step is north. So the correct action here is to go north.

Looking at the current location, the Parlor has exits to east, north, south, and west. The user has been moving between these areas, but they might be stuck in a loop. The previous actions included going north, east, south, west, and back. The challenge is to avoid repeating actions that don't lead forward.

The next step in the original plan after the Parlor was to go south, but that led back to the Shower. Then they went east to Cookery, then north to Pantry, west back to Parlor. Now, in the Parlor again, the user needs to proceed in a new direction. The next step in the sequence was to go south again, but that might not be helpful. Alternatively, maybe they need to go east again, but the user has to check if that's part of the plan.

Wait, the original instructions said after the Parlor, go south, then take a trip south again, then east. But in the current state, the user is in the Parlor again. The next step according to the original plan was to go south, but that might not be the right move. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east again to proceed further. However, the user has to ensure they're not repeating actions that don't lead to progress. Since the Parlor has an unblocked exit to the east, maybe that's the way to go.

Looking at the current room description, there's a safe here, but it's empty. The exits are south, east, north, and west.

The next step might be to check if there's a way to get to the closet where the frisbee is. Since the safe is empty, maybe the frisbee is in another location. Alternatively, perhaps the user needs to find a different path that leads to the closet. But the current room doesn't mention a closet. Maybe the closet is in the Pantry or another room. The user needs to explore more rooms, but they're stuck between Parlor and Pantry. The next action should be to try a different direction, maybe west again, but the user has already done that. Alternatively, check if there's a hidden item or a different exit. However, the instructions say to follow the specific path. The user needs to go south from the Pantry, which is the next step in the original plan. So the next command should be go south.

You are in a cookery. An ordinary kind of place. Let's see what's in here.

You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a rack. You wonder idly who left that here. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well

There is an open gate leading north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. There is an unguarded exit to the south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in TextWorld following a specific path. The goal is to eventually retrieve the frisbee from the closet and win the game.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Cookery room. The previous steps have involved moving between rooms like Salon, Cubicle, Shower, Parlor, Pantry, and back to Cookery. The instructions mention a sequence of directions: north, east, north, west, north, east, east, south, south, east, and finally retrieving the frisbee.

But the user is stuck in a loop between the Pantry and Cookery rooms. Each time they go south from Pantry, they end up in Cookery, and going north from Cookery takes them back to Pantry. This loop is preventing them from progressing further.

The key here is to identify that the loop is happening between Pantry and Cookery. The user needs to find a different path. Looking at the descriptions, the Cookery room has an unguarded exit to the east and a west exit. The Pantry has an open gate south, unguarded east, and unblocked north. 

Since the user's goal is to get to the closet and retrieve the frisbee, maybe the closet is in a different area. But according to the initial instructions, after moving around, they need to go east again. However, the current path is looping, so the user needs to find an alternative route.

Wait, the user's previous actions included going east from the Parlor, which led to the Pantry. Then going south to Cookery, then north back to Pantry. So the loop is between Pantry and Cookery. To break the loop, the user needs to go east from Cookery instead of north. The Cookery room has an unguarded exit to the east. Going east from Cookery might lead to a new room that's not part of the loop.

So the next step should be to go east from Cookery. That way, they exit the loop and proceed to a new area, which might be closer to the closet where the frisbee is located. Therefore, the correct action here is to go east.

-= Closet =-
You find yourself in a closet. A normal kind of place.



There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

There is a frisbee on the floor.

Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is playing a text adventure game called TextWorld. The goal is to follow a series of directions to eventually retrieve a frisbee from a closet and win.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Closet. The prompt mentions there's a frisbee on the floor. The previous steps involved moving through various rooms: Salon, Cubicle, Shower, Parlor, Cookery, Pantry, and back to the Closet. The user has been moving in a cycle between some rooms, possibly getting stuck in a loop.

The goal steps mentioned earlier were: go north, east, north, west, north, east, east, south, south, east, and finally retrieve the frisbee from the closet. But the user has been moving between the Closet and Cookery, maybe repeating steps without progress.

Now, in the Closet, the user needs to pick up the frisbee. The instruction says to "recover the frisbee from the floor of the closet." Since the frisbee is already mentioned as being on the floor, the next logical step is to pick it up. However, the game might require a specific command like "take frisbee" or "get frisbee." But the user's previous commands have been directions like "go north" or "go east," so maybe the correct action here is to take the frisbee.

But the user's last action was "go east," which led them to the Closet. Now, in the Closet, the frisbee is present. The next step should be to take it. However, the game's response might require the exact command. Since the user has been using "go" commands, perhaps the correct action here is to "take frisbee" or "get frisbee." But the user's previous responses have been "go" commands, so maybe the system expects "take" as the next action. However, the user's instructions say to output the command as a short command, so "take frisbee" or "get frisbee" would be the correct next step. But the user might have to use the exact wording the game expects. Alternatively, since the frisbee is on the floor, maybe the command is simply "take frisbee" or "get frisbee." But in the previous steps, the user hasn't used any "take" commands, so maybe the correct action here is to take the frisbee.
