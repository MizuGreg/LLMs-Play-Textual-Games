I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First, it would be a great idea if you could take a trip east. After that, head east. Then, travel south. Following that, go east. Following that, make an effort to move east. Then, try to head north. Okay, and then, pick-up the Comic Strip Calendar from the floor of the workshop. And if you do that, you're the winner!

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to win this game. The user's goal is to first go east, then east again, then south, then east, then north, and finally pick up the Comic Strip Calendar from the workshop's floor. 

Looking at the current position, the user is in the Office, and the previous moves have been going back and forth between the Office and Cookhouse. The user has been going east and west repeatedly, which might be a loop. The problem is that the user is stuck in a cycle between these two rooms without making progress towards the workshop.

The next step should be to break this loop. Since the user is in the Office, maybe instead of going west again, they should look for another exit. The Office has an exit to the east and a west entrance. But going east again leads back to the Cookhouse, which is where the loop starts. 

Wait, the user needs to reach the workshop. The workshop is mentioned in the task as the place where the Comic Strip Calendar is on the floor. So maybe the workshop is connected to the Office or Cookhouse through a different path. But according to the current room descriptions, the Office has an exit to the east (Cookhouse) and west (Cookhouse again). The Cookhouse has an exit to the north, which might be the workshop. 

Wait, in the Cookhouse description, there's an unblocked exit to the north. So maybe going north from Cookhouse leads to the workshop. But the user has been stuck in the loop between Office and Cookhouse. To get to the workshop, the user needs to go north from Cookhouse. 

But the user is currently in the Office. The previous moves were going east (to Cookhouse) and then west back to Office, creating a loop. To break this, the user should go north from Cookhouse instead of continuing the loop. 

So the next action should be to go north from the Cookhouse. But how to get there? The user is in the Office, so they need to go east to Cookhouse, then north. But the user has been going back and forth. So the correct path is: from Office, go east to Cookhouse, then north to workshop. Then pick up the calendar. 

But the user is currently in the Office again after going west. So the next step is to go east again to Cookhouse, then north to workshop. But the user has to make sure they don't loop again. So the next command should be go north from Cookhouse. But the user is in the Office, so first go east to Cookhouse, then north. 

Wait, the user's last action was go west, leading back to Cookhouse. So the next step is to go north from Cookhouse. But the user is in the Office, so they need to go east to Cookhouse first. Then go north. So the next action is go east to Cookhouse, then north. But the user is in the Office, so the next command is go east. Then, once in Cookhouse, go north. 

But the user is in the Office again, so the next step is to go east to Cookhouse, then north. So the next command is go east.
