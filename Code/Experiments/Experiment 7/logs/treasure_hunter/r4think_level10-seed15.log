THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing a text-based game where they have to navigate through different rooms and find a banana in a workshop. The current location is the Kitchenette. The previous steps were going south from the Bedchamber, then south again to the Shower, then west to the Canteen, and then west again to the Kitchenette.

The goal is to retrieve the banana from the workshop. The user needs to follow the path: go south, then south again, then west, then north, and finally get the banana. But so far, they've been moving south and west, but maybe they're stuck in a loop. The current room is the Kitchenette, which has an exit to the east and north. The bowl is on the floor, but that's not the banana. The next step should be to go north from the Kitchenette to proceed towards the workshop. But the user might be repeating actions without progress. So, instead of going west again, they should try north. The next action should be 'go north' to move towards the workshop where the banana is located.
</think>go north
