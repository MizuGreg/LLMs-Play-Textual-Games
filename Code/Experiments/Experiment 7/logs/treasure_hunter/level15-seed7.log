Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First step, go to the south. Okay, and then, go to the east. If you can finish that, make an effort to take a trip north. And then, try to venture north. Once you finish that, make an attempt to head east. Following that, recover the latchkey from the pan in the cookhouse. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Recreation Zone =-
You've entered a recreation zone.



There is an open passageway leading north. There is an open hatch leading south.

-= Laundry Place =-
You have walked into a laundry place. Not the laundry place you'd expect. No, this is a laundry place. You begin looking for stuff.

You can see an opened cabinet, which looks ordinary, in the corner. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You make out a table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

There is an open portal leading east. There is an open hatch leading north.

There is a loaf of bread on the floor.

I am sorry to announce that you are now in the cubicle.

You see a coffer. You make out an opened trunk. The trunk is empty! What a waste of a day!

There is an open gateway leading south. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east.



>                                                                                                                                -= Cubicle =-0/5

-= Cookhouse =-
Wow! You're in a cookhouse. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You make out a pan. The pan is ordinary. On the pan you see a latchkey. You scan the room, seeing a bowl. However, the bowl, like an empty bowl, has nothing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the bowl.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.



>                                                                                                                                -= Cookhouse =-0/6
THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to recover the latchkey from the pan in the cookhouse. So far, they've navigated through several rooms: Recreation Zone, Laundry Place, Bedroom, Bathroom, Cubicle, and now Cookhouse. In the Cookhouse, they found the pan with the latchkey. The next step is to take the latchkey.

Wait, the user hasn't actually picked it up yet. The current room is Cookhouse, and the pan has the latchkey. The instruction says to take the latchkey from the pan. So the next action should be to take the latchkey. But the previous actions were moving around, and the last action was going east to reach the Cookhouse. Now, they need to interact with the pan. The correct command here is to take the latchkey from the pan. Since the pan is in the Cookhouse, the command should be "take latchkey from pan" or something similar. But in TextWorld, the exact phrasing might matter. Let me check the previous messages. The user saw the pan with the latchkey, so the next step is to take it. The correct command would be "take latchkey from pan".
</think>take latchkey from pan
