THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Spare Room and the Dish-Pit. They've been going back and forth between these two areas repeatedly. The goal is to recover the passkey from the bench and then win.

First, I need to recall the original task: travel west, then south, east, north, then get the passkey. But the user has already done some of these steps. They started by going west to the Spare Room, then south to the Dish-Pit, then north back to the Spare Room, and so on. It seems they're stuck in a cycle between these two rooms.

Looking at the current position, they're in the Dish-Pit again. The exit to the east is unguarded, and the north exit is available. But the user keeps going south from the Spare Room to the Dish-Pit and back. The problem is that the passkey is mentioned in the initial description of the Studio, but the user hasn't found it yet. However, the bench where the passkey is located isn't mentioned in the current areas. Wait, the initial description of the Studio mentioned a stand, but not a bench. The Cookhouse might have the bench? Or maybe the Dish-Pit has it?

Wait, in the Dish-Pit, the user sees a refrigerator. The bench isn't mentioned here. The Spare Room has a counter. The Cookhouse has an open passageway east. Maybe the bench is in the Cookhouse? But the user hasn't been there yet. The user's path has been through the Studio, Spare Room, Dish-Pit, and back. They need to go east from the Cookhouse to reach the bench. But the user hasn't gone east from the Cookhouse yet. Let me check the previous steps.

The user was in the Cookhouse, then went north back to the Studio. But the Cookhouse has an exit east. So maybe the user needs to go east from the Cookhouse to find the bench with the passkey. However, in the current steps, the user is looping between the Spare Room and Dish-Pit. So the next step is to go east from the Cookhouse. But how to get there?

Wait, the user's last action was going north from the Dish-Pit back to the Spare Room. The next step should be to go east from the Spare Room to the Studio again. But the user has been going back and forth. Maybe the user needs to go east from the Spare Room to the Studio, then find the bench. But the initial description of the Studio only mentions a stand. Maybe the bench is in the Cookhouse. The user needs to go east from the Cookhouse. But how to get there?

Wait, the user was in the Cookhouse earlier. Let me retrace. The user went from the Studio south to the Dish-Pit, then north to the Spare Room, then south again to the Dish-Pit, and so on. The Cookhouse was reached when the user went north from the Dish-Pit. Wait, no. Earlier, when the user was in the Dish-Pit, they could go north to the Spare Room. But the Cookhouse is another area. The user needs to go east from the Cookhouse. But how to get to the Cookhouse again?

Wait, the user was in the Cookhouse at step 6. Then they went north back to the Studio. Now, they are in the Spare Room again. To reach the Cookhouse again, they need to go east from the Spare Room. Wait, the Spare Room has an exit to the east. So from the Spare Room, go east to the Studio, then south to the Dish-Pit, then east to the Cookhouse? Wait, no. The Cookhouse is connected to the Dish-Pit? Let me check the descriptions.

In the Dish-Pit, there's an unguarded exit to the east. So from the Dish-Pit, going east leads to the Cookhouse. So the user needs to go east from the Dish-Pit to the Cookhouse. But the user is currently in the Spare Room. So the path is: Spare Room (current) → go east to Studio → go south to Dish-Pit → go east to Cookhouse. Then, in the Cookhouse, there's an open passageway east. Maybe the bench is there. Once the user is in the Cookhouse, they can go east to find the bench with the passkey. Then pick it up and win.

But the user hasn't gone east from the Cookhouse yet. So the next step is to go east from the Cookhouse. However, the user is currently in the Spare Room. So the correct path is: from Spare Room, go east to Studio, then south to Dish-Pit, then east to Cookhouse, then east again to find the bench. But the user is stuck in a loop between Spare Room and Dish-Pit. So the next action should be to go east from the Spare Room to the Studio, then proceed to the Dish-Pit and Cookhouse.

But the user's last action was going north from Dish-Pit to Spare Room. So the next step is to go east from Spare Room to Studio. Then from Studio, go south to Dish-Pit, then east to Cookhouse. Then from Cookhouse, go east to find the bench. Once there, pick up the passkey and win.

But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action is to go east from the Spare Room to the Studio. Then proceed to the Dish-Pit and Cookhouse. However, the user is currently in the Spare Room, so the next command should be "go east" to reach the Studio again. Then continue the path to the Cookhouse and find the bench.

There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You make out a table. The table is ordinary. On the table you make out a bug.

There is an open door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked.
