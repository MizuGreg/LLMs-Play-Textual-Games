Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, try to travel east. Then, travel east. With that over with, venture north. Then, pick up the cucumber from the floor of the lounge. Got that? Good!

-= Basement =-
You've come into a typical room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be typical. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the basement. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Sauna =-
You've just sauntered into a sauna.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Sauna room. The goal is to first travel east twice, then north, then pick up the cucumber from the lounge. Wait, but the current location is the Sauna. So the user first went east from the basement to the sauna. Then, the next step was to go east again, but the sauna's east exit is unguarded. Wait, the initial instructions said to travel east twice. So first, from basement to sauna (east), then from sauna to east again? But the sauna's east is an exit. Maybe the next step is to go east again from the sauna. But the user is in the sauna now. The next step after the first east was to go east again, then north. So after arriving in the sauna, the next action should be to go east again. But the user is in the sauna, and the east exit is unguarded. So the next command should be "go east" again. Then, after that, go north. Then pick up the cucumber. But the user hasn't picked up the cucumber yet. So the steps so far: went east from basement to sauna (first east), then need to go east again (second east), then north. Then pick up cucumber. So the next action is to go east again. But the user is in the sauna, and the east exit is available. So the next command is "go east".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in TextWorld. The initial goal was to travel east twice, then north, and pick up the cucumber in the lounge. But the user has already moved east from the basement to the sauna, then east again to the kitchenette. Wait, no, the first move was east from basement to sauna, then the next command was go east again, which took them to the kitchenette. So they've gone east twice already. The next step in the original goal was to venture north. But in the current room (kitchenette), there's an exit to the north and west. So maybe they need to go north from here. But the user's previous action was go east, which might have been a mistake because they already did two easterly moves. Wait, the original task was: first, travel east, then east again, then north. So after the two easts, they should be in the kitchenette, then go north. But the user's last action was go east again, which might have been redundant. But according to the current room (kitchenette), the exits are north and west. So maybe the next step is to go north from the kitchenette. But the user's previous action was go east, which might have been a loop. Wait, the user is in the kitchenette now. The original plan was after two easts, go north. So from the kitchenette, going north would be the next step. But the user's last command was go east again, which might have been a mistake. But the current room is kitchenette, so maybe the user needs to go north now. So the next action should be go north. But the user's previous action was go east, which might have been a loop. However, the user is in the kitchenette, so the next step is to go north. Therefore, the correct next command is go north.

You are in an ordinary kind of place. That is to say, you're in a lounge.



There is an unblocked exit to the south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

There is a cucumber on the floor.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Lounge now, and there's a cucumber on the floor. The original task was to travel east twice, then north, and pick up the cucumber.

Wait, the user started in the basement, went east to the Sauna, then east again (but that might not be possible, maybe they went north from sauna?), then ended up in the Lounge. Now they're in the Lounge, which is the destination after moving north from the kitchenette. So the next step is to pick up the cucumber. The previous actions have already taken care of moving east twice and then north. The next step is to take the cucumber. So the command should be 'take cucumber' or 'pick up cucumber'. But in the game's commands, 'take' is the correct verb. So the next action is 'take cucumber'.
