Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First stop, go north. After that, recover the banana from the floor of the workshop. Alright, thanks!

-= Kitchenette =-
Fancy seeing you here. Here, by the way, being the kitchenette.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. There is an unguarded exit to the north.

There is a bowl on the floor.

-= Workshop =-
You find yourself in a workshop. A typical kind of place.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

There is a banana on the floor.
