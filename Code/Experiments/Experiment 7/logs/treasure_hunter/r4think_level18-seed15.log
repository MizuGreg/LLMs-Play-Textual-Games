It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First thing I need you to do is to go east. After that, ensure that the gateway within the canteen is open. Then, make an effort to venture north. After that, make an attempt to go north. Next, make an effort to take a trip north. That done, make an effort to head west. And then, go to the south. After that, pick up the sandwich from the floor of the lounge. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Kitchenette =-
You arrive in a kitchenette. An usual kind of place.

You see a shelf. The shelf is ordinary. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You move on, clearly depressed by TextWorld.

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in TextWorld. The goal is to follow a specific sequence of actions to eventually pick up the sandwich and win.

First, the initial steps were going east from the kitchenette, then east again into the canteen. But then they ended up in the laundromat, went west back to the canteen. So now they're back in the canteen again. The problem is that the previous actions might have led to a loop between the canteen and laundromat.

The user's next step should be to check the north gateway again. The original plan was to ensure the gateway is open. But in the current state, the gateway is closed. So maybe they need to find a way to open it. However, the user hasn't found a key or any item that can open it yet. Alternatively, maybe there's another path.

Wait, the instructions said after going east, check the gateway in the canteen. But the user tried going east again and ended up in the laundromat. So maybe the correct approach is to first open the gateway. But how? The user hasn't found a way to open it yet. Maybe they need to look for a key or another item. But in the current rooms, there's a locked basket in the laundromat. Maybe that's a clue. But the user hasn't interacted with it yet.

Alternatively, maybe the user is stuck in a loop between the canteen and laundromat. So instead of going east again, they should try a different direction. The canteen has a west exit, but that's where they came from. The north gateway is closed. So perhaps the next step is to try to open the gateway. But how? Maybe there's a way to open it by using an item from the laundromat. But the user hasn't checked the basket yet. So maybe they should go east again to the laundromat, check the basket, and see if that helps in opening the gateway.

But the user is currently in the canteen again. So the next action should be to try to open the north gateway. However, the game might not allow that unless there's a key. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to find another path. But according to the initial instructions, after going east, check the gateway, then go north twice, then west, south, pick up the sandwich. But the current state is in the canteen, so maybe the next step is to go north again, even though the gateway is closed. But that might not work. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to find a way to open the gateway first.

Wait, the original plan was: go east, ensure the gateway is open, then go north. But in the current state, the gateway is closed. So maybe the user needs to find a way to open it. But how? The user hasn't found any keys or items that can open it. So maybe the correct next step is to go east again to the laundromat, check the locked basket, and see if that's part of the solution. Then, perhaps use the basket's contents to open the gateway. But the user hasn't tried that yet. So the next action should be to go east again to the laundromat and check the basket.

Okay, let's break this down. The user needs to follow a specific sequence to win. The goal is to go east, open the canteen's north gateway, venture north, try north again, take a trip north, then west, south, pick up the sandwich, and win.

So far, the user has gone east from the kitchenette, ended up in the canteen, then tried going east again, which took them to the laundromat. They checked the locked basket but couldn't open it. Then they went west back to the canteen, tried going north, but the gateway was closed. Then they opened the gateway. Now, the next step after opening the gateway is to go north again. But the user might be stuck in a loop between the canteen and laundromat. Wait, no, after opening the gateway, they should be able to go north. But the previous attempt to go north failed because the gateway was closed, but now it's open. So the next step is to go north from the canteen. Then, after that, the plan is to try north again, then west, south, etc. So the next action should be to go north again. But the user just opened the gateway, so maybe that's the next step. However, the user might have already tried going north once. Wait, the original steps said after ensuring the gateway is open, venture north, then attempt to go north again. So after opening the gateway, the user should go north. Then, perhaps the next step is to go north again. But the user is in the canteen now, gateway is open. So the next command is go north. But the user might be in a loop if they keep going back and forth. But since the gateway is now open, going north should be possible. So the next action is go north.

Fancy seeing you here. Here, by the way, being the lounge. Let's see what's in here.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a bar. The bar is ordinary. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a couch. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The couch is typical. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You think about smashing the couch to bits, throwing the bits in the dump, etc, until you get bored. Look over there! a desk! Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is an unguarded exit to the east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

There is a sandwich on the floor.
