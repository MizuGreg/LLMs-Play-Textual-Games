Welcome to another profound session of TextWorld! Here is how to play! Your first objective is to attempt to head north. And then, take a trip east. And then, try to go to the north. With that done, go to the north. With that over with, go to the west. Next, head west. Then, pick up the paper towel from the safe within the sauna. Got that? Good!

-= Bedroom =-
