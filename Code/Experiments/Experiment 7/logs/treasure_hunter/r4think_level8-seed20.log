Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First thing I need you to do is to attempt to go west. And then, attempt to head south. With that over with, make an attempt to venture east. Okay, and then, retrieve the loaf of bread from the floor of the garage. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Salon =-
Well how about that, you are in a place we're calling a salon.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

-= Study =-
You find yourself in a study. A typical kind of place. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and retrieve a loaf of bread from the garage. The current challenge is that they're looping between the Salon and Study rooms by going west and east repeatedly.

First, I need to recall the game's objective: go west, then south, then east, and retrieve the bread from the garage. So far, the user has tried going west and east, but they're stuck in a loop. The next step should be to find a way to progress beyond the loop.

Looking at the environment, the Study room mentions an exit to the south. The user might have tried going south already, but maybe they didn't check the south direction properly. Alternatively, maybe the south exit leads to another area that's not being explored yet.

Since the user is looping between the Salon and Study, perhaps the key is to go south from the Study room. The Study room's description says there's an exit to the south. So the next logical step is to go south from the Study. That would take them out of the loop and into a new area, possibly leading to the garage where the bread is located.

The user needs to break the loop by not repeating west and east but instead taking the south exit. So the next action should be to go south.
</think>go south

-= Sauna =-
Ah, the sauna. This is some kind of sauna, really great normal vibes in this place, a wonderful normal atmosphere. And now, well, you're in it.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

There is a keycard on the floor.
