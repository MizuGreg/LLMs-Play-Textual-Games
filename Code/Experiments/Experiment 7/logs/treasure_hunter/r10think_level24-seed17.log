It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is how to play! Your first objective is to make an effort to move north. Once you succeed at that, head west. After that, take the keycard from the stand in the attic. Having taken the keycard, make an effort to go east. Next, assure that the gateway inside the studio is unlocked with the keycard. If you have unlocked the gateway, open the gateway within the studio. Then, make an effort to head east. Following that, make an effort to go south. After that, pick up the garlic clove from the fridge within the dish-pit. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Salon =-
You are in a salon. An usual kind of place.



There is an unblocked exit to the north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.
