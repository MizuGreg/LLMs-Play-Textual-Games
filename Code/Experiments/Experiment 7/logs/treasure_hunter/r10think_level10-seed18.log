You are now playing a profound game of TextWorld! Here is how to play! Your first objective is to make an attempt to take a trip west. And then, travel south. Once you manage that, try to go east. Following that, go to the east. That done, pick-up the latchkey from the floor of the chamber. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Cubicle =-

There is an unguarded exit to the west.
