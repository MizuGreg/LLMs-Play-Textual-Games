Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. Your first objective is to venture west. After that, retrieve the broom from the floor of the basement. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Bedroom =-
You are in a bedroom. A typical kind of place.



There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

>                                                                                                                                -= Bedroom =-0/1
AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go west
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Basement =-
You arrive in a basement. A normal one.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a broom and a fly larva on the floor.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text-based game where they need to venture west first, then retrieve the broom from the basement. So far, they've gone west from the bedroom into the basement. Now, in the basement, they see a broom and a fly larva. The goal is to get the broom.

The current location is the basement. The user needs to pick up the broom. But the prompt says there's a broom on the floor. So the next step should be to take the broom. However, the user has to make sure they're not in a loop. Since they just entered the basement and found the broom, taking it should be the next action. The previous steps were moving west, so now the action is to pick up the broom. The answer should be "take broom".
