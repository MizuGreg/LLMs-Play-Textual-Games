Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an fast paced round of TextWorld? You do! First stop, make an attempt to travel north. And then, pick up the knife from the floor of the cookhouse. That's it!

-= Shower =-
This might come as a shock to you, but you've just moved into a shower. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Cookhouse =-
You've entered a cookhouse. You begin looking for stuff.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

There is a knife on the floor.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and collect items. The goal mentioned is to play through a fast-paced round, which likely involves reaching a specific location and picking up an item.

First, the user started in the shower, went north to the cookhouse. In the cookhouse, they found a knife on the floor. The next step would be to pick up the knife. But the user's previous action was going north, and now they're in the cookhouse. The prompt says to pick up the knife from the floor of the cookhouse. So the next logical step is to pick up the knife.

Wait, the user's last action was going north, which led them to the cookhouse. The current room is the cookhouse, and the knife is there. So the next action should be to pick up the knife. But the user might be in a loop if they keep moving between rooms without progress. However, since the knife is in the cookhouse and the user is already there, picking it up is the next step. The user needs to collect the knife to proceed. So the correct command is to pick up the knife.
