Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, make sure that the portal inside the cellar is open. After that, make an effort to move south. Then, move west. Then, make an attempt to go to the north. Once you succeed at that, head west. And then, pick-up the peanut from the floor of the studio. Got that? Good!

-= Cellar =-
I am pleased to announce that you are now in the cellar.



There is a closed portal leading south. There is an open hatch leading north.

-= Cubicle =-
Guess what, you are in the place we're calling the cubicle. You begin looking for stuff.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a safe. You can see a closed locker. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a desk. But the thing is empty.

There is an open passageway leading east. There is an open gateway leading north. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to open the portal in the cellar, then move south, west, north, west again, and finally pick up the peanut in the studio. So far, they've opened the portal and moved south to the kitchenette, then west to the cubicle. Now, in the cubicle, they found a safe and a desk but nothing useful. The next step according to the initial plan was to go north from the cubicle. But the user is stuck here, maybe because they're in a loop or didn't find the peanut yet.

Wait, the current location is the cubicle. The directions here are east, north, and west. The user needs to go north from here. But the initial plan said after moving west in the kitchenette, go north. But in the cubicle, going north might lead back to the kitchenette or somewhere else. Also, the peanut is in the studio, so maybe they need to find a way to the studio. But the path isn't clear yet. The user might be stuck in the cubicle, so the next step is to go north from here. But the user might have already done that. Alternatively, maybe they need to check the safe or locker for the peanut. But the safe is closed. Wait, the user hasn't picked up anything yet. The peanut is in the studio, so they need to get there. The path from the cubicle north might lead to the studio. Let me check the previous steps again.

The user was in the cellar, opened the portal, went south to kitchenette, then west to cubicle. Now, in the cubicle, the next step is to go north. But the initial plan said after moving west in the kitchenette, go north. But the user is in the cubicle now. So maybe the next step is to go north from the cubicle. But the user might have already done that. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east from the cubicle to find the peanut. But the peanut is in the studio. The studio is probably accessible via the north exit from the cubicle. So the next action should be to go north from the cubicle. But the user might be in a loop, so maybe they need to try a different action, like checking the safe or locker. But the safe is closed. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west from the cubicle to exit. But the exit is unguarded. So perhaps the correct next step is to go north from the cubicle to reach the studio where the peanut is. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action is to go north.
</think>go north

-= Steam Room =-
Well how about that, you are in a place we're calling a steam room. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.



There is an open gateway leading south. There is an open door leading west.

-= Studio =-
You arrive in a studio. A standard one.



There is an open door leading east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked.

There is a peanut on the floor.

Okay, let's see. The user's goal is to open the portal in the cellar, then move south, west, north, west again, and pick up the peanut in the studio. So far, they've opened the portal, went south to the kitchenette, west to the cubicle, north to the steam room, and west to the studio. Now they're in the studio, and there's a peanut on the floor. The next step should be to pick up the peanut. But the user hasn't done that yet. The previous actions have led them to the studio, so the next command should be to pick up the peanut. They need to make sure they collect it to complete the game.
