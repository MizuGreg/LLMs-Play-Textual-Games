Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is how to play! First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to travel west. Next, travel south. That done, try to go west. After that, pick up the fly larva from the floor of the cookhouse. Alright, thanks!

-= Cubicle =-
Well, here we are in a cubicle. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.



There is an open door leading south. There is an open gateway leading west.

-= Study =-
Of every study you could have walked into, you had to come round an usual one. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You see a locked coffer. You make out a trunk. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You scan the room for a stand, and you find a stand. The stand is typical. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is a closed gate leading west. There is an open gateway leading east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

-= Vault =-
You make a grand eccentric entrance into a vault. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You see a suitcase. You make out a counter. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the counter.

You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what I need to do here. The user wants me to navigate through these different rooms and eventually pick up the fly larva from the cookhouse. Let me recap the steps I've taken so far.

First, I started in the Cubicle, went west to the Study. Then from the Study, I went south to the Vault. Now, I'm in the Vault. The goal is to travel west, then south, pick up the fly larva. Wait, the initial instructions said: travel west, then south, then west again, then pick up the larva. But I'm not sure if I'm in the right place yet.

In the Vault, the user mentioned there's an unguarded exit to the west. So maybe I should go west from here. But the next step after the Vault would be... Let me check the previous steps again. The user said after going west from the Cubicle, then south to the Study, then west again? Or was it after the Study, go south to the Vault? Hmm, maybe I need to check the path again.

Wait, the original instructions were: travel west (from Cubicle), then south (from Cubicle?), then west again. But the user's movement so far was Cubicle -> Study (south), then Vault (north from Study? Or was it south? Wait, the Study's description says there's an open gateway leading east and a closed gate leading west. Then the user went south from the Study to the Vault. So now in the Vault, the exits are north and west. So maybe the next step is to go west from the Vault. But the goal was to go west, then south, then west again. Maybe I need to go west from the Vault, then south? Or perhaps I'm getting confused with the directions.

Alternatively, maybe the correct path is Cubicle (west to Study), then Study (south to Vault), then Vault (west to some other room), then from there south to the cookhouse. But I need to pick up the fly larva in the cookhouse. So maybe after going west from the Vault, I reach a room that's connected to the cookhouse via south. Let me think: the user needs to go west, then south, then west again. So maybe after the Vault, going west would be the next step. Then from there, go south to the cookhouse. But I need to confirm the directions. The Vault has a west exit, so going west from there. Then, perhaps that leads to the cookhouse. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the cookhouse is in a different direction. But according to the initial instructions, after traveling west, south, then west again, then pick up the larva. So maybe the path is Cubicle -> Study (south), then Vault (north?), but that doesn't fit. Wait, the Study's description says there's a closed gate leading west and an open gateway leading east. Then the user went south from the Study to the Vault. So now in the Vault, the exits are north (back to Study) and west. So going west from Vault would be the next step. Then, from there, maybe south to the cookhouse. But I need to check if that's the correct path. Alternatively, maybe after going west from the Vault, I reach a room that's connected to the cookhouse via south. So the next step is to go west from the Vault. Then, once in that room, go south to the cookhouse, then pick up the larva. But I need to make sure that's the correct sequence. Since the user hasn't picked up the larva yet, I need to proceed to the cookhouse. So the next action should be to go west from the Vault.

-= Cookhouse =-
You're now in the cookhouse.

You can make out a locked case, which looks usual, in the room.

There is a closed portal leading north. There is an open hatch leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a fly larva on the floor.
