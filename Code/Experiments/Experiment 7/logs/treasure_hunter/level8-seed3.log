Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First, it would be fantastic if you could travel north. Next, venture east. With that over with, travel east. With that accomplished, pick-up the bug from the floor of the kitchenette. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Shower =-
I am sorry to announce that you are now in the shower.



There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

You arrive in a basement. A normal one.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a broom on the floor.
