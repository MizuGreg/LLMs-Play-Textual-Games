It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! First, it would be great if you could try to head east. With that done, go south. With that over with, try to go west. With that over with, pick-up the worm from the floor of the kitchenette. Alright, thanks!

-= Bedroom =-
You're now in a bedroom. You begin looking for stuff.

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a box. You shudder, but continue examining the room.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the north. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

You've entered a bar. You can barely contain your excitement.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and collect items. The goal mentioned is to pick up the worm from the kitchenette.

First, I need to recall the steps given in the initial instructions. The user was told to go east, then south, then west, and finally pick up the worm. But in the current state, they're in the Bar room. Let me check the environment again.

In the Bar room, the possible directions are north, south, west. The user's previous action was going east from the Bedroom to the Bar. Now, the next step according to the initial plan was to go south from the Bar. But the user hasn't done that yet. Wait, the initial instructions said after going east, go south, then west, then pick up the worm. So from the Bar, going south would take them to the next room. But the user might be stuck in a loop if they keep going back and forth between rooms.

Wait, the user is in the Bar. The previous action was going east from the Bedroom. Now, the next step should be to go south from the Bar. But the user might have already done that? Let me check the history again. The initial steps were: go east (from Bedroom to Bar), then go south (from Bar to maybe the kitchenette?), then west, then pick up the worm. But the user is currently in the Bar, so the next step is to go south. However, the user might be in a loop if they can't find the kitchenette. Alternatively, maybe the worm is in the kitchenette, so they need to reach there.

Wait, the initial instruction said to go east, then south, then west, then pick up the worm. So from the Bar, going south would be the next step. But the user is in the Bar now. So the next action should be to go south. However, the user might have already done that. Let me check the current state. The current room is the Bar, and the user is supposed to go south next. So the next step is to go south. But the user might be in a loop if they can't proceed. Alternatively, maybe the worm is in the kitchenette, which is accessible via the Bar's south direction. So the correct next step is to go south from the Bar to reach the kitchenette, then pick up the worm. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action is to go south.

-= Laundromat =-
You are in a laundromat.



There is an unguarded exit to the north. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing a text adventure game, and they need to follow specific steps to reach the goal. The initial instructions were to go east, then south, then west, and pick up the worm in the kitchenette. But the current scenario is in a laundromat, and the user has to figure out the next move.

First, I need to recall the goal. The main objective is to pick up the worm from the kitchenette. The user has already moved through the bedroom, bar, and now the laundromat. The next step would be to find the kitchenette. Since the laundromat has exits to the north and west, maybe going north would lead to the kitchenette. But wait, the previous steps were east, south, west. Maybe the user is moving in a loop? Let me check the previous moves.

In the bedroom, they went east to the bar, then south to the laundromat. Now, from the laundromat, the exits are north and west. If they go west, maybe they can reach the kitchenette. But the initial instruction was to go west after going east and south. Wait, the user's first actions were: go east (from bedroom), then south (to bar), then west (to laundromat). Now, they need to pick up the worm in the kitchenette. So perhaps from the laundromat, going north would take them back to the bar, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe the kitchenette is connected via another exit. But the current room is the laundromat, which has a north and west exit. The user needs to find the kitchenette. Maybe the kitchenette is in the west direction from the laundromat. But the user has already gone west once. Wait, maybe the user is in a loop between the bar and laundromat. So instead of going west again, they should go north to the bar and then find another path. But the initial instructions said to go west after going east and south. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west from the laundromat to reach the kitchenette. But the problem is that the user might be stuck in a loop. So the next action should be to go north from the laundromat to the bar, then maybe east again to find the kitchenette. But the user needs to pick up the worm, so maybe the kitchenette is connected via the bar. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west from the laundromat to reach the kitchenette. But the initial steps were east, south, west. So perhaps the user is in the laundromat, and the next step is to go north to the bar, then east to the bedroom, but that's not helpful. Wait, the original plan was to go east, then south, then west, then pick up the worm. But the user is now in the laundromat, which is the third step. So maybe the next step is to go west from the laundromat to reach the kitchenette. But the user has already gone west once. Maybe the user is in a loop between the laundromat and bar. Therefore, the next action should be to go north to the bar, then east to the bedroom, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west from the laundromat to the kitchenette. But the user has already done that. Wait, the initial steps were: bedroom -> east (bar) -> south (laundromat) -> west (kitchenette). So maybe the user is in the laundromat, and the next step is to go west to the kitchenette. But the user hasn't done that yet. Wait, the user's previous action was going south to the laundromat. Now, from the laundromat, the exits are north and west. So the next step is to go west to the kitchenette. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action should be go west. But the user might be in a loop if they keep moving between the bar and laundromat. However, according to the initial instructions, after going east, south, west, they should pick up the worm. So from the laundromat, going west would take them to the kitchenette where the worm is. Therefore, the next action is go west.

-= Kitchenette =-
A well framed board tells you that you are now in the kitchenette.

You smell a sickening smell, and follow it to a saucepan. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

There is a worm on the floor.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Kitchenette, and the goal is to pick up the worm from the floor. The previous actions were going east, south, west, which led here. The current room has a worm on the floor. The user needs to pick it up. But the prompt says to follow the steps: first, state the goal step by step, then past actions, check for loops, and then the next command.

Wait, the user's last action was going west, which brought them to the Kitchenette. Now, in the Kitchenette, there's a worm on the floor. The instruction was to pick-up the worm. So the next step should be to pick it up. But the system message says to output only the command. So the answer should be "pick up worm" or something similar. But the user's previous actions were moving directions, and now they need to interact with the worm. The key is to make sure that the next action is the correct one to pick up the worm. The user might have missed that earlier, but now they're here, so the next command is to pick up the worm.
</think>pick up worm
