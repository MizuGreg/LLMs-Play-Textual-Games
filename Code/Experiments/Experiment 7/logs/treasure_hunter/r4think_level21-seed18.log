It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First of all, ensure that the portal within the studio is open. After that, attempt to travel north. Then, retrieve the latchkey from the floor of the cubicle. Alright, thanks!

-= Studio =-
You've just walked into a studio.

You can make out a closed coffer. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. The table is normal. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.

There is a closed portal leading north. There is an open gateway leading west.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through TextWorld. The goal is to open the portal in the studio, go north, retrieve the latchkey from the cubicle, and probably proceed further. But the user is stuck because they tried to go north before opening the portal.

First, the goal steps are: open the portal, go north, get the latchkey. So far, the user tried to go north but was told to open the portal first. Then they tried to open the portal north, but the system didn't recognize it. Maybe the correct command is "open portal" without specifying north, or "open the portal"?

Wait, the initial instruction said to ensure the portal is open, then go north. So the first step is opening the portal. The user tried "open portal north" but the system didn't understand. Maybe the correct command is just "open portal" or "open the portal". Then after opening, go north. Then retrieve the latchkey.

The user is in a loop because they keep trying to open the portal north, which isn't working. So the next step is to use a different phrasing, like "open the portal" instead of "open portal north". Then proceed to go north once it's open.

-= Cubicle =-
This might come as a shock to you, but you've just stumbled into a cubicle. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You see a bureau.

There is an open portal leading south. There is an open passageway leading east.

There is a latchkey on the floor.
