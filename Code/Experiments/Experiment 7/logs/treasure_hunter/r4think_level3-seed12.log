Welcome to TextWorld! Here is how to play! First of all, you could, like, venture south. Okay, and then, recover the bug from the floor of the closet. Alright, thanks!

-= Vault =-
You find yourself in a vault. A normal one.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the south. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

-= Closet =-
You've entered a closet. Let's see what's in here.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a durian and a bug on the floor.

That's not a verb I recognise.

You can't see any such thing.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in a closet in TextWorld. Their goal is to recover the bug from the floor of the closet. They tried "recover the bug from the floor of the closet." But the system said that's not a verb. Then they tried "take the bug from the floor," but it didn't work. The system said they can't see any such thing.

Hmm, maybe the correct command is just "take the bug." Or perhaps "get the bug." The previous attempts used "recover" and "take," but maybe the game expects a different verb. Since "take" didn't work, maybe "get" is the right synonym. Alternatively, maybe the bug is in a different location, but the user is in the closet, so it should be on the floor. Wait, the initial description said there's a durian and a bug on the floor. So the user needs to take the bug. Maybe the correct command is "take the bug." But the user tried that and it didn't work. Maybe the game is case-sensitive? Or maybe the verb is "pick up" instead of "take." But the user tried "take" and it didn't work. So perhaps the correct action is "get the bug." Alternatively, maybe the user needs to first check the floor again. But the user is already in the closet. Maybe the correct command is "take the bug from the floor," but the system says that's not possible. Wait, the user tried "take the bug from the floor" and it didn't work. Maybe the correct command is just "take the bug." Let me think. The game might require the exact phrase. Since "take the bug" is the correct action, but the user tried "take the bug from the floor" which is redundant. Maybe the correct command is "take the bug." So the next action should be "take the bug."
