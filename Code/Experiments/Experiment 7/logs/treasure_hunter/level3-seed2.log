It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, you could, like, travel west. And then, lift the latchkey from the floor of the workshop. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Spare Room =-
You find yourself in a spare room. An usual kind of place. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.



There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Workshop =-
You've just sauntered into a workshop.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the north.

There is a gummy bear and a latchkey on the floor.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in the Workshop, which is part of the TextWorld game. The goal is to lift the latchkey from the floor and then win. The user has already moved west from the Spare Room into the Workshop. Now, in the Workshop, there's a gummy bear and a latchkey on the floor. The next step is to pick up the latchkey.

Wait, the user's previous action was "go west", which took them to the Workshop. Now, they need to interact with the latchkey. The instruction says to lift the latchkey, so the next action should be to pick it up. But the game might require using the correct verb. In TextWorld, sometimes you have to use "take" or "pick up" to pick items. So the next command should be "take latchkey" or "pick up latchkey". Let me check the previous messages. The user was told to "lift the latchkey from the floor of the workshop". So maybe "lift latchkey" is the correct command here. But I need to make sure that's the right verb. Alternatively, "take latchkey" might work. Since the user is in the Workshop and the latchkey is on the floor, the correct action is to pick it up. So the next step is to take the latchkey. Once that's done, the game should be won. So the next command is "take latchkey".
