Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First stop, make an attempt to move east. Then, try to move east. Then, move north. With that done, take a trip west. And then, recover the passkey from the floor of the bar. Once that's all handled, you can stop!
