Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is how to play! First stop, attempt to move east. Then, pick up the key from the toolbox inside the vault. And then, check that the gate is unlocked with the key. And then, look and see that the gate inside the vault is ajar. Then, make an effort to take a trip north. Then, go north. With that accomplished, head north. Once you manage that, attempt to head west. With that over with, attempt to venture south. Then, attempt to go south. Then, go west. Once you do that, go west. If you can accomplish that, move west. With that accomplished, pick-up the keycard from the floor of the canteen. Alright, thanks!

-= Cellar =-
You've entered a cellar.

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a rack. The rack is ordinary. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is an unguarded exit to the east.

SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in the Vault, trying to go north but the gate is already unlocked. They tried unlocking it again, but it says it's already unlocked. So maybe the problem is that the gate is open but they need to proceed.

Wait, the initial goal was to pick up the key from the toolbox, unlock the gate, then go north. But after unlocking, the gate is open, but maybe they need to check if the gate is ajar. The user mentioned that after unlocking, they should check if the gate is ajar. But the game says the gate is closed, even though it's unlocked? That doesn't make sense. Or maybe the gate is open, but the user needs to move through it.

Wait, the user tried to go north after unlocking, but the game says they have to open the gate first. But the gate was already unlocked. Maybe the error is that the gate is not actually open. So even though they unlocked it, they need to open it again. But the game says it's unlocked, so maybe the correct action is to go north despite the message. Or perhaps the message is a red herring, and the gate is open. The user needs to proceed north.

Alternatively, maybe the user is in a loop because they keep trying to unlock a gate that's already unlocked. The next step would be to go north regardless of the message. The game might be testing if they can proceed even if the prompt says to unlock again. So the correct action is to go north.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is stuck in the Vault, repeatedly trying to go north but getting told they need to open the gate first. The goal was to pick up the key, unlock the gate, check the gate is ajar, then go north. But the game seems to be stuck in a loop where the gate is already unlocked but the user can't proceed.

First, the goal steps: pick key, unlock gate, check gate is ajar, go north. The user has already picked the key and unlocked the gate. The next step was to check if the gate is ajar. Maybe the game is expecting the user to check the gate's state instead of trying to go north immediately.

Second, past actions: key picked, gate unlocked. Now, the next step should be to check if the gate is open. The user might be trying to go north before confirming the gate is open. The game's message is confusing because the gate is already unlocked, but maybe it's not considered "ajar" yet.

Third, the loop: the user is repeatedly trying to go north without checking the gate's state. The error messages are misleading. To break the loop, the user should check the gate's status instead of trying to move. The correct action here is to check the gate's state, not go north again.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in the Vault, trying to check the gate's open status repeatedly but getting the same response. The goal was to pick up the key, unlock the gate, check the gate is ajar, then go north. The user has already picked the key and unlocked the gate. The next step was to check if the gate is open, but the game says it's closed. But earlier, the user tried to go north and got told to open the gate first, even though it was already unlocked. There's a contradiction here.

Maybe the gate is unlocked but not open. The user needs to open it instead of just unlocking. The game might be confused between unlocking and opening. So the next step should be to open the gate, not just check its status. The user has been checking the status instead of trying to open it. So the correct action is to open the gate.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Garage and Studio, going back and forth between them. The goal was to pick up the key, unlock the gate, check the gate is ajar, then go north. But after unlocking the gate, the user tried to go north but got stuck in a loop between Garage and Studio.

Wait, maybe the user didn't actually proceed past the Vault. The initial steps were correct: pick up the key, unlock the gate, but then the gate was closed again. Then the user tried to go north, but the game moved them to Cookery, then Garage, Studio, etc., but didn't reach the next area. So the loop is between the Garage and Studio, moving back and forth.

The next step should be to find the keycard in the canteen as mentioned in the initial instructions. But the user hasn't done that yet. However, the current path is stuck in a loop. So the user needs to break the loop by finding another way. Maybe the correct action is to go west from the Garage, as mentioned in the descriptions. The user has been going north and south repeatedly. Trying west might lead them to a new area where the keycard is located. So the next action should be to go west.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Garage and Studio, moving back and forth. The goal was to pick up the key, unlock the gate, check the gate is ajar, then go north. But after unlocking the gate, the user tried to go north but got stuck in a loop between Garage and Studio. The keycard was supposed to be picked up from the canteen, but the user hasn't done that yet.

Wait, the initial steps were correct: pick up the key, unlock the gate. Then, the user should have checked if the gate is ajar. But the game said the gate was closed even though it was unlocked. Then, the user tried to go north, but the game moved them to Cookery, then Garage, Studio, etc., without reaching the next area. Now, the user is looping between Garage and Studio, moving north and south repeatedly.

The next step should be to find the keycard in the canteen. But the user hasn't been to the canteen yet. The current path is stuck in a loop, so the user needs to break it. The previous actions of going north and south are not working. Maybe the correct action is to go west from the Garage, as mentioned in the descriptions. The user tried going east earlier but ended up back in the Garage. Trying west might lead them to a new area where the keycard is located. So the next action should be to go west.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Garage and Studio, moving back and forth. The goal was to pick up the key, unlock the gate, check the gate is ajar, then go north. But after unlocking the gate, the user tried to go north but got stuck in a loop between Garage and Studio. The keycard was supposed to be picked up from the canteen, but the user hasn't done that yet.

Wait, the initial steps were correct: pick up the key, unlock the gate. Then, the user should have checked if the gate is ajar. But the game said the gate was closed even though it was unlocked. Then, the user tried to go north, but the game moved them to Cookery, then Garage, Studio, etc., without reaching the next area. Now, the user is looping between Garage and Studio, moving north and south repeatedly.

The next step should be to find the keycard in the canteen. But the user hasn't been to the canteen yet. The current path is stuck in a loop, so the user needs to break it. The previous actions of going north and south are not working. Maybe the correct action is to go west from the Garage, as mentioned in the descriptions. The user tried going east earlier but ended up back in the Garage. Trying west might lead them to a new area where the keycard is located. So the next action should be to go west.

-= Basement =-
You arrive in a basement. A normal kind of place.

You make out a locked suitcase, which looks normal, in the corner. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a table. The table is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.
