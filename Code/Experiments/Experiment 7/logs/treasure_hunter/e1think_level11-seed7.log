Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to go east. Following that, retrieve the latchkey from the pan. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Cubicle =-
I am sorry to announce that you are now in the cubicle.

You see a coffer. You make out an opened trunk. The trunk is empty! What a waste of a day!

There is an open gateway leading south. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east.

-= Cookhouse =-
Wow! You're in a cookhouse. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You make out a pan. The pan is ordinary. On the pan you see a latchkey. You scan the room, seeing a bowl. However, the bowl, like an empty bowl, has nothing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the bowl.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text-based game where they need to follow specific steps to achieve the goal. The initial instruction was to go east, then retrieve the latchkey from the pan, and then stop.

First, the user went east from the cubicle, which led them to the cookhouse. In the cookhouse, they saw a pan with a latchkey on it. The next step should be to pick up the latchkey. But the user might be confused because the previous action was going east, and now they're in the cookhouse. The goal is to retrieve the latchkey, so the next logical step is to take the latchkey from the pan.

Wait, the user's last action was going east, which brought them to the cookhouse. Now, they need to pick up the latchkey. The prompt says to retrieve the latchkey from the pan. So the next command should be to take the latchkey. But the user might have already done that? Let me check the history again.

The user's last message shows they are in the cookhouse, with the pan having a latchkey. The previous action was going east. So the next step is to take the latchkey. The user hasn't done that yet. So the correct next action is to take the latchkey. But the user might be in a loop if they keep going back and forth. However, in this case, the user is in the cookhouse, and the pan is there. So the next step is to take the latchkey. Then, after that, they can stop. So the next command should be "take latchkey from pan" or something similar. But the game might expect a specific command format. The user needs to take the latchkey, so the correct action is to take it.
