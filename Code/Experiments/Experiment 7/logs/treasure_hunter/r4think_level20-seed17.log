-= Cookery =-
You are in a cookery. A typical one.

Hey, want to see a case? Look over there, a case. What's that over there? It looks like it's a chair. You shudder, but continue examining the chair. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Silly chair, silly, empty, good for nothing chair.

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

If you're wondering why everything seems so typical all of a sudden, it's because you've just shown up in the kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.



There is an open gateway leading east. There is a closed hatch leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is in a text-based game where they need to follow a series of steps to reach a goal. The current scenario is in the Kitchen, and they've tried to go west but there's a closed hatch. The previous attempts included opening the gateway in the Bathroom, but that didn't help.

First, I need to recall the initial task. The user was told to go west, check the gateway, open the hatch, then go west again, open the portal in the office, go north, check the attic door, go north again, and recover the potato from the salon. But they're stuck in the Kitchen now.

Looking at the current environment: the Kitchen has an open gateway east, a closed hatch west, and an exit north. The user tried to go west but couldn't because the hatch is closed. They need to open the hatch first. But in the previous steps, they opened the gateway in the Bathroom, which might not be relevant here.

Wait, the user's last action was "go west" in the Kitchen, which led to the current state. The system responded that they have to open the hatch first. So the next logical step is to open the hatch west. But the user tried that already? Or maybe they didn't. Let me check the history.

Looking back, the user first went west from Cookery to Bathroom, then tried to check the gateway, which was closed. Then they tried to go west again, but the system said they had to open the gateway first. Then they opened the gateway, went west to Kitchen. Now, in the Kitchen, the hatch west is closed. So the next step is to open that hatch.

But the user's last action was "go west" which didn't work. So the correct next action should be to open the hatch. However, the user might have already tried that. Wait, in the Kitchen, the hatch is closed. So the user needs to open it. The command would be "open hatch" or "open west hatch".

But the system might not recognize "open hatch" if the hatch is west. So maybe the correct command is "open hatch west" or "open the hatch". Alternatively, maybe "open hatch" is sufficient.

The user's previous attempt was "open gateway" in the Bathroom, which worked. Now, in the Kitchen, the hatch is closed, so the next step is to open it. Then, after opening, they can go west again. Then proceed with the next steps as per the original plan.

So the next action should be "open hatch".

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in the Office, and they just opened the portal north. The goal was to recover the potato from the salon, but the current steps involve moving through different rooms.

First, the goal was to follow specific steps: go west, check gateway, open hatch, go west, open portal, go north, check attic door, go north, recover potato. So far, they've opened the portal in the Office. The next step should be to go north from the Office. But the current room is the Office, and the portal is north. Wait, the Office has a closed portal leading north. The user just opened it, so now they can go north. Then, the next step would be to go north into the attic. But the user needs to check if the door in the attic is open. However, the previous step mentioned ensuring the attic door is open before going north. But in the current state, after opening the portal, they can go north. So the next action is to go north. But the user might have already done that. Wait, the user is in the Office, and after opening the portal, they can go north. So the next step is to go north into the attic. Then check the door. But the user's next action should be "go north" from the Office. Then, once in the attic, check the door. But the user's previous steps might have missed that. Alternatively, maybe the portal is the entrance to the attic. So after opening the portal, go north to the attic. Then check the door. Then proceed to the salon to get the potato. So the next command is "go north".

You can make out a chest. You can make out a closed cabinet.

There is a closed door leading north. There is an open portal leading south.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Salon, and there's a potato on the floor. The goal was to recover the potato from the floor of the salon. So the next step is to pick up the potato. The previous actions have led them here, so the final action is to take the potato.

First step: The goal is to follow the steps given, which include recovering the potato. The user has already opened the necessary doors and portals, so the last step is to get the potato.

Second step: The user has already gone through the attic, opened the door, and arrived at the salon. The next step is to pick up the potato.

Third step: Check if there's a loop. The user is in the salon, and the potato is here, so no loop. The next action is to take the potato.

Final answer: take potato
