Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an exciting round of TextWorld? You do! Here is how to play! First thing I need you to do is to make an attempt to venture north. Then, pick-up the poem from the floor of the bedchamber. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Spare Room =-
You are in a spare room. A typical one.

You can make out an opened ordinary looking cabinet in the corner. The cabinet is empty, what a horrible day!

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Bedchamber =-
You find yourself in a bedchamber. An usual kind of place.



There is an unblocked exit to the east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

There is a poem on the floor.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user wants me to figure out the next step in the TextWorld game. The goal is to pick up the poem from the bedchamber and then win. 

First, I need to recall the current state. The user just moved north from the spare room into the bedchamber. In the bedchamber, there's a poem on the floor. The exit to the east is unblocked, and there's an exit to the south back to the spare room.

The user's previous action was "go north", which brought them to the bedchamber. Now, the next step is to pick up the poem. But the prompt says that if you pick up the poem, you're the winner. So the key is to collect the poem.

Looking at the current description, the poem is on the floor. So the next action should be to pick it up. However, in TextWorld, sometimes you need to use specific commands like "take poem" or "get poem". But the user's previous action was "go north", which is a direction. Since the poem is already in the room, the correct command would be to take it.

Wait, but the user's last message shows that after moving north, the bedchamber is described, and the poem is on the floor. The user's next action should be to pick up the poem. But the user's previous action was moving north, which is the first step. Now, the second step is to pick up the poem. So the next command should be "take poem" or "get poem".

But the user's instruction says that if you pick up the poem, you're the winner. So the correct action here is to take the poem. The user hasn't done that yet. So the next step is to take the poem from the floor.
