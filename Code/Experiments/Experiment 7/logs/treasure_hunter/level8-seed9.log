Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First, it would be fantastic if you could make an effort to head east. With that done, make an attempt to go to the east. After that, go to the north. And then, retrieve the teapot from the floor of the canteen. That's it!

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is in a text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and retrieve a teapot from the canteen. The current setup seems to be looping between the Basement and Spare Room. 

First, the goal is to go east, then north, and finally get the teapot from the canteen's floor. But the user has been moving between the Basement and Spare Room repeatedly, which suggests they might be stuck in a loop.

Looking at the previous actions: the user went east from the Bedchamber to the Basement, then kept going south and north, which brings them back to the Basement. The system is probably guiding them in a cycle here. The problem is that the teapot is in the canteen, which might be a different location. But the current rooms mentioned are Basement and Spare Room, so maybe the canteen is elsewhere.

Wait, the initial instruction said to go east, then north, then get the teapot from the canteen's floor. But the user is stuck in a loop between Basement and Spare Room. Maybe the correct path isn't through those rooms. Alternatively, perhaps the canteen is in a different part of the map that's not being explored yet.

But the user's actions so far have been going east, south, north, south, north, south, north again. That's a loop. The next step should be to break the loop. Since the system keeps saying to go south or north, maybe using a different synonym like "go west" or "exit" could help. The Basement has an unguarded exit to the west, so maybe going west from the Basement would lead to another area.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to find the canteen directly. But according to the initial directions, after going east and north, they should reach the canteen. However, the current path isn't leading there. Perhaps the correct sequence is to go east, then north, then east again to reach the canteen. But the user is stuck in a loop, so they need to find another way out.

The key is to stop the loop. Since the previous actions are repeating, the next move should be different. Maybe instead of going south, go west from the Basement. The Basement has an exit to the west, so "go west" might be the next step. That would break the loop and lead to a new room, possibly the canteen.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is stuck in a loop between the Bedchamber, Basement, and Spare Room. The goal is to go east, then north, then get the teapot from the canteen. But the current path isn't leading to the canteen.

First, the goal steps are: go east, then north, then retrieve the teapot. So far, the user has been moving east, south, north, creating a loop. The next step should be to break the loop. Since going west from the Basement leads back to the Bedchamber, maybe that's not helpful. But the user has been repeating south and north, so maybe trying a different direction like west when possible.

The last action was going west, which brought them back to the Bedchamber. The Bedchamber's instruction is to go east again. But that just loops back. The problem is that the canteen isn't in the current rooms. Maybe the teapot is in the Spare Room? But the user hasn't checked there. Wait, the initial instruction said to go east, then north, then get the teapot from the canteen's floor. Maybe the canteen is in a different area not yet explored.

Alternatively, perhaps the user needs to find the canteen by going east from the Basement. The Basement has an exit to the east. So maybe going east from the Basement would lead to the canteen. But the user has been going south and north instead. The key is to stop the loop and go east from the Basement. The previous actions kept looping, so the next step should be to go east instead of south or north.
