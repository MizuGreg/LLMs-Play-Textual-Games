Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an exciting round of TextWorld? You do! First of all, you could, like, pick-up the type A passkey from the floor of the still cubicle. And then, unlock the type A door. Then, open the type A door. And then, go to the south. With that over with, try to venture west. If you can do that, try to travel west. Then, attempt to venture south. And then, try to travel east. Following that, go to the east. Next, try to go to the east. With that accomplished, make an attempt to take a trip south. Okay, and then, go to the south. Following that, head west. And then, lift the printer from the floor of the austere workshop. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Still Cubicle =-
You find yourself in a cubicle. A still kind of place.

You make out a desk. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The desk is ordinary. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.

There is a closed type A door leading south. There is an unblocked exit to the east.

There is a type A passkey on the floor.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to solve this TextWorld game. The goal is to pick up the type A passkey, unlock the type A door, go south, then west, south, east, etc., and eventually take the printer from the workshop to win.

First, the user tried "pick-up type A passkey" but got an error. The system says that's not a recognized verb. Oh right, in TextWorld, the correct verb is "take" instead of "pick-up". So maybe the user is using the wrong command.

Then they tried "unlock type A door", but the system asked what they want to unlock it with. The user didn't have the passkey yet, so they tried to pick it up again. But the system still doesn't recognize "pick-up". So the problem is using the wrong verb.

So the next step is to use "take" instead of "pick-up" to pick up the passkey. Once that's done, they can use the passkey to unlock the door. Then proceed with the steps mentioned.

The user is stuck in a loop because they keep trying "pick-up" which isn't valid. The correct action is "take" the passkey. Then unlock the door with it. After that, go south, west, etc., and finally take the printer.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in TextWorld to collect items and unlock doors. The goal is to pick up the type A passkey, unlock the door, go through various directions, and eventually take the printer from the workshop.

First, the user already picked up the passkey and unlocked the door. They went south into the shower, then west back to the cubicle. Now they're in the cubicle again, which is confusing because they've been there before. The next step mentioned was to go east, but the user is stuck in a loop between the cubicle and the shower.

The problem here is that the user is repeatedly entering the same areas without making progress. The key is to find a new path that hasn't been taken yet. The previous actions included going west from the shower, which led back to the cubicle. Now, instead of going west again, they should try going east from the cubicle. The cubicle has an unblocked exit to the east, which might lead to a new area. The user needs to explore that direction to avoid the loop and proceed towards the workshop where the printer is located.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Cubicle and the Shower. They keep going west and east, which is causing them to cycle between the two rooms. The goal is to eventually reach the Austere Workshop and take the printer to win.

First, the goal steps are: pick up the passkey, unlock the door, go south to the shower, then west to the cubicle, then east to find the workshop. But the user is looping between cubicle and shower instead of moving forward.

Second, the user has already picked up the passkey and unlocked the door. They went south to the shower, then west to cubicle, then east back to shower, and so on. The next step should be to find a way out of the loop and proceed towards the workshop.

Third, the loop is because they're repeatedly going west and east between the two rooms. To break the loop, they need to find another exit. In the Cubicle, there's an unguarded exit to the north. Maybe that's the way to go. Instead of west or east, try going north from the Cubicle to escape the loop and reach the workshop.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Cubicle and the Shower. They keep going west and east, which is causing them to cycle between the two rooms. The goal is to eventually reach the Austere Workshop and take the printer to win.

First, the goal steps are: pick up the passkey, unlock the door, go south to the shower, then west to the cubicle, then east to find the workshop. But the user is looping between cubicle and shower instead of moving forward.

Second, the user has already picked up the passkey and unlocked the door. They went south to the shower, then west to cubicle, then east back to shower, and so on. The next step should be to find a way out of the loop and proceed towards the workshop.

Third, the loop is because they're repeatedly going west and east between the two rooms. To break the loop, they need to find another exit. In the Cubicle, there's an unguarded exit to the north. Maybe that's the way to go. Instead of west or east, try going north from the Cubicle to escape the loop and reach the workshop.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Cubicle and the Shower. They keep going west and east, which is causing them to cycle between the two rooms. The goal is to eventually reach the Austere Workshop and take the printer to win.

First, the goal steps are: pick up the passkey, unlock the door, go south to the shower, then west to the cubicle, then east to find the workshop. But the user is looping between cubicle and shower instead of moving forward.

Second, the user has already picked up the passkey and unlocked the door. They went south to the shower, then west to cubicle, then east back to shower, and so on. The next step should be to find a way out of the loop and proceed towards the workshop.

Third, the loop is because they're repeatedly going west and east between the two rooms. To break the loop, they need to find another exit. In the Still Cubicle, there's an open type A door leading south. Maybe that's the way to go. Instead of east or west, try going south from the Cubicle to escape the loop and reach the workshop.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Cubicle and the Shower. They keep going west and east, which is causing them to cycle between the two rooms. The goal is to eventually reach the Austere Workshop and take the printer to win.

First, the goal steps are: pick up the passkey, unlock the door, go south to the shower, then west to the cubicle, then east to find the workshop. But the user is looping between cubicle and shower instead of moving forward.

Second, the user has already picked up the passkey and unlocked the door. They went south to the shower, then west to cubicle, then east back to shower, and so on. The next step should be to find a way out of the loop and proceed towards the workshop.

Third, the loop is because they're repeatedly going west and east between the two rooms. To break the loop, they need to find another exit. In the Still Cubicle, there's an open type A door leading south. Maybe that's the way to go. Instead of east or west, try going south from the Cubicle to escape the loop and reach the workshop.

You are in a cookhouse. A standard one. Let's see what's in here.

What's that over there? It looks like it's a board. The board is normal. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. Silly board, silly, empty, good for nothing board.

There is an open passageway leading east. There is an open portal leading north. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.
