Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First, it would be good if you could go north. With that accomplished, open the portal. After pulling open the portal, try to take a trip west. Then, venture north. And then, attempt to venture west. After that, venture west. Then, pick-up the chocolate bar from the floor of the workshop. That's it!

-= Study =-
You arrive in a study. An ordinary kind of place.

You can make out a stand. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.

You arrive in a cookhouse. A standard kind of place.

You make out a chair. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is a closed portal leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.

Okay, let's break this down. The user wants me to figure out the next action in the text-based game. The goal is to follow a series of directions: go north, open the portal, go west, north, west, then pick up the chocolate bar.

Looking at the current environment, the user is in the Cookhouse. The previous action was going north from the Study. Now, the Cookhouse has a closed portal leading west. The user needs to open the portal. The prompt says to pull open the portal. So the next step should be to open it. But the user might have already tried going north or south, which are the options given. Wait, the user's last action was going north, which led to the Cookhouse. Now, the portal is closed, so the next step is to open it. The instruction says after pulling open the portal, go west, then north, then west again, then pick up the chocolate.

But in the current state, the user is in the Cookhouse. The portal is closed. So the first thing to do is open the portal. The user needs to find the right command. The previous steps were go north, then open the portal. So the next action should be to open the portal. But the user might have to use a specific verb. The prompt says "pull open the portal," so maybe the command is "open portal" or "pull portal." But in the game's context, the correct command might be "open portal." Let me check the previous messages. The user was told to "open the portal" after going north. So the next action is to open the portal. Then proceed west, etc. So the next command should be "open portal."

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in TextWorld. The goal is to follow a series of directions: go north, open the portal, then go west, north, west again, then pick up the chocolate bar.

First, the initial steps were going north from the study to the cookhouse. Then, the user tried to open the portal. The response was "You open portal." So that's the second step done. Now, the next steps according to the original instructions are after opening the portal, go west, then north, then west again, and finally pick up the chocolate.

But in the current state, after opening the portal, the user is in the cookhouse. The available directions are north and south. The portal is open, so maybe going west is possible now. Wait, the portal was leading west, so maybe after opening it, the user can go west. But the previous message says "There is a closed portal leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south." But then the user opened the portal, so maybe now the west direction is accessible.

So the next step after opening the portal would be to go west. Then, after that, the instructions say to venture north, then west again. Then pick up the chocolate. So the next action should be going west from the cookhouse. But the user just opened the portal, so maybe they can go west now. Let me check the previous steps again.

The user's past actions: went north (from study to cookhouse), opened the portal. Now, the next step is to go west. So the next command should be "go west".

-= Lounge =-
You've just shown up in a lounge.

You see a bed. The bed appears to be empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the bed.

There is an open portal leading east. There is an open gate leading west. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north.

So far, they've gone north from the study to the cookhouse, opened the portal, and then went west to the lounge. Now, the next step according to the initial instructions was to venture north from the lounge. But in the current scene, the user is in the lounge, and the available exits are east, west, and north.

Wait, let me check the original instructions again. The user said: first go north, open the portal, then take a trip west, then venture north, then attempt to venture west, then west again, then pick up the chocolate. So after opening the portal in the cookhouse, they went west to the lounge. Then from the lounge, they need to go north. But in the current state, the user is in the lounge, and the next step is to go north. However, the game's response says that in the lounge, you can go north. So the next action should be to go north. But the user's previous action was go west, leading to the lounge. Now, the next step is to go north from the lounge. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next command should be "go north". However, the user's last action was "go west", and the current location is the lounge. The next step in the plan is to go north from the lounge. So the correct next action is "go north".

You've moved into an ordinary room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be ordinary. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the recreation zone.

You can make out a bookshelf. The bookshelf is ordinary. But there isn't a thing on it. You can see a bar. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the bar.

There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

Original steps: After opening the portal, go west, then north, then west again, then west again, then pick up the chocolate. So after the recreation zone, the next step should be west. But the user is in the recreation zone, and the exit west is available. So the next action should be to go west. But the user might be in a loop if they keep going back. However, the instructions say to follow the steps as given. So the next step is to go west from the recreation zone. The previous action was going north, so the next is west. The user hasn't picked up the chocolate yet, so that's the next step. The answer should be "go west".

You've just walked into a kitchenette.

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a cabinet. You can make out a saucepan. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in a text-based game. The goal is to follow a specific sequence of actions: go north, open the portal, go west, north, west, west, then pick up the chocolate bar.

So far, the user has gone north from the study to the cookhouse, opened the portal, then went west to the lounge, north to the recreation zone, and west to the kitchenette. Now, the next step according to the original instructions was to go west again. But in the current room (kitchenette), the available exits are east and west. The user just tried going west again, but maybe that's not leading them towards the chocolate bar.

Wait, the original plan was after opening the portal in the cookhouse, go west to the lounge, then north to recreation zone, west to kitchenette, and then maybe another west? But the kitchenette's west exit might lead back somewhere. Alternatively, maybe the chocolate bar is in a different room. The user needs to check if they've missed a room where the chocolate is. But according to the previous steps, they haven't picked up the chocolate yet. The instruction says after going west three times, pick up the chocolate. So maybe after the kitchenette, going west again would lead to the workshop where the chocolate is. But the current room is kitchenette, and the exit west is unguarded. So the next step should be to go west again. But the user already did that. Wait, the user's last action was go west to kitchenette, and now the next step would be to go west again from kitchenette. But the previous response was "go west" again. However, the system message says to not repeat the same action if it's not progressing. But maybe the user is in a loop here. Alternatively, maybe the correct path is to go east from kitchenette instead of west. Let me check the current room description again.

In the kitchenette, the exits are east and west. The user is supposed to go west three times. But after the first west (cookhouse -> lounge), then north (recreation zone), then west (kitchenette), then maybe another west? But the kitchenette's west exit might lead back to the recreation zone or another room. Wait, maybe the user is stuck in a loop between kitchenette and recreation zone. So instead of going west again, maybe they should go east from kitchenette to recreation zone, then check other directions. But the original plan was to go west three times. Alternatively, maybe the chocolate is in the kitchenette, but the user hasn't checked. However, the instruction says to pick up the chocolate after going west three times. So perhaps the correct next step is to go west again from kitchenette, even if it's a loop, because the game might require that. But the system message says to break loops by using synonyms. However, the user has already gone west three times. Wait, let me recount:

1. Study -> Cookhouse (north)
2. Cookhouse -> Lounge (west)
3. Lounge -> Recreation Zone (north)
4. Recreation Zone -> Kitchenette (west)
5. Now, from Kitchenette, go west again (step 5). But that might loop back. However, the original plan was to go west three times. Wait, the original steps were: go north, open portal, go west, north, west, west. So after opening the portal in cookhouse, go west (lounge), then north (recreation), then west (kitchenette), then west again. But from kitchenette, going west might not be possible. Wait, the current room is kitchenette, and the exits are east and west. So going west from kitchenette would take them to another room. Maybe the workshop? But the user hasn't found the chocolate yet. The chocolate is in the workshop. So perhaps the correct next step is to go west again from kitchenette, even if it's a loop, because the game requires it. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east from kitchenette to recreation zone, then check other directions. But according to the original plan, the next step after kitchenette is to go west again. So the answer should be "go west" again. However, the system message says to not repeat the same action if it's not progressing. But in this case, maybe it's necessary. So the next action is go west.

So far, the user has gone north from the study to the cookhouse, opened the portal, went west to the lounge, then north to the recreation zone, then west to the kitchenette, and then west again to the workshop. Now they're in the workshop, which is the last step before picking up the chocolate bar.

The current room is the workshop, and the chocolate bar is on the floor here. The next step is to pick it up. The user needs to take the chocolate bar, so the command should be "take chocolate bar" or something similar. But looking at the previous commands, the user has been using "go" commands. However, in the workshop, the available actions might include picking up items. The game's prompt mentions the chocolate bar and broccoli on the floor, so the correct action here is to take the chocolate bar. The user hasn't done that yet, so the next step is to take it.
