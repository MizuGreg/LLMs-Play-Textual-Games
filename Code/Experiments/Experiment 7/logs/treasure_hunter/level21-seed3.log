It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, venture south. With that done, attempt to take a trip south. Then, recover the shadfly from the floor of the laundromat. And once you've done that, you win!

You're not going to believe this, but you've just entered a bedchamber.

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and find the shadfly in the laundromat. The goal is to go south, then take a trip south again, recover the shadfly, and win.

Looking at the current situation, the user is in the Restroom again, which they've been looping through. They've been moving between the Restroom, Lounge, Kitchen, and back to Restroom repeatedly. The problem is that they're stuck in a loop without making progress towards the shadfly.

The previous actions were going south, then west, then north, and so on, which keeps them cycling between rooms. The key is to find a way to break this loop. The user needs to find the laundromat, which is mentioned in the initial task. The laundromat's floor has the shadfly, so they need to reach there.

But the current path leads them back to the Restroom. Maybe they need to find another exit or a different path. The Kitchen has an exit to the east, which might lead to another area. Alternatively, perhaps the cabinet in the Restroom has something, but it's empty. Wait, the initial task says to recover the shadfly from the laundromat's floor. So maybe the laundromat is a different room they haven't reached yet.

Wait, the user started by going south from the Bedchamber to the Lounge, then West to Restroom, then North to Kitchen, then South back to Restroom. They need to find a way to get to the laundromat. Maybe the laundromat is connected to the Kitchen via the east exit? Or perhaps there's another exit they haven't tried.

In the Kitchen, there's an unblocked exit to the east. Let me check the previous steps. When in the Kitchen (step 0/8), the user went south to Restroom again. But maybe they should try going east from the Kitchen instead. The east exit is unblocked. If they go east from the Kitchen, maybe they can reach the laundromat.

So the next step should be to go east from the Kitchen to find the laundromat, then look for the shadfly on the floor. That would break the loop and progress towards the goal.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Restroom, Lounge, Kitchen, and Bedchamber. The goal is to go south, then take a trip south, recover the shadfly from the laundromat, and win.

First, the goal steps are: venture south, take a trip south, recover the shadfly, then win. So far, the user has been moving between rooms without reaching the laundromat. The laundromat isn't mentioned in the current rooms, so maybe it's a different area.

The user is in the Lounge again (step 18). Previous actions led them back to the same places. They need to find a way to get to the laundromat. The initial steps required going south from the Bedchamber, but maybe the laundromat is connected through another exit.

In the Bedchamber, there's a closed portmanteau. Maybe opening it could lead to the laundromat? But the user hasn't interacted with it yet. Alternatively, the laundromat might be accessible from the Kitchen's east exit, but that led back to the Bedchamber.

Wait, the user is in the Lounge again. The exit to the west is unguarded. Maybe going west from the Lounge would lead to a different area. But the previous attempt to go west from the Lounge led back to the Restroom. Hmm.

The key is to break the loop. The user has been cycling through rooms without progress. The next step should be to check the portmanteau in the Bedchamber, as it's the only item mentioned there. Opening it might reveal a path to the laundromat. So the next action should be to open the portmanteau.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's tackle this. The user is stuck in a loop between the Restroom, Lounge, Kitchen, and Bedchamber. The goal is to go south, then take a trip south, find the shadfly in the laundromat, and win.

First, the goal steps are: venture south, then take a trip south, recover the shadfly from the laundromat's floor, then win. So far, the user has been moving between rooms without reaching the laundromat. The laundromat isn't mentioned in the current rooms, so maybe it's a different area.

The user is in the Lounge again (step 22). Previous actions led them back to the same places. They need to find a way to get to the laundromat. The initial steps required going south from the Bedchamber, but maybe the laundromat is connected through another exit.

In the Bedchamber, there's a closed portmanteau. Maybe opening it could lead to the laundromat? But the user hasn't interacted with it yet. Alternatively, the laundromat might be accessible from the Kitchen's east exit, but that led back to the Bedchamber.

Wait, the user is in the Lounge again. The exit to the west is unguarded. Maybe going west from the Lounge would lead to a different area. But the previous attempt to go west from the Lounge led back to the Restroom. Hmm.

The key is to break the loop. The user has been cycling through rooms without progress. The next step should be to check the portmanteau in the Bedchamber, as it's the only item mentioned there. Opening it might reveal a path to the laundromat. So the next action should be to open the portmanteau.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Restroom, Lounge, Kitchen, and Bedchamber. The goal is to go south, then take a trip south, recover the shadfly from the laundromat, and win. So far, the user has been moving between these rooms without reaching the laundromat.

First, the goal steps are: venture south, then take a trip south, find the shadfly in the laundromat's floor, then win. The user has already ventured south from the Bedchamber to the Lounge, but hasn't reached the laundromat yet. The laundromat isn't mentioned in the current rooms, so maybe it's a different area.

The user is in the Bedchamber again (step 37). The only item here is a closed portmanteau. Previous attempts to open it failed. Maybe the portmanteau is the key to getting to the laundromat. But the user can't see anything in it. Alternatively, maybe the laundromat is connected through another exit, like the east exit from the Kitchen, but that led back to the Bedchamber.

The key is to break the loop. The user has been cycling through rooms without progress. The next step should be to check the portmanteau again, maybe there's something inside that can help. But the user tried opening it before and couldn't. Maybe they need to try a different action, like looking for the shadfly in the current room, but it's not mentioned here. Alternatively, maybe the laundromat is accessible from the Kitchen's east exit, but that's where they came from.

Wait, the initial task says to recover the shadfly from the laundromat's floor. The user hasn't found the laundromat yet. Maybe the laundromat is the Kitchen? But the Kitchen has a pan, not a shadfly. Or maybe the laundromat is the Restroom? But the Restroom has an empty cabinet. Hmm.

The user needs to find a way out of the loop. The next action should be to check the portmanteau again, even though it's closed. Maybe there's a way to open it that wasn't tried before. Alternatively, maybe the laundromat is connected through the north exit from the Bedchamber, but that's unblocked. Wait, the Bedchamber has an exit to the north, which is unblocked. Maybe going north from the Bedchamber leads to the laundromat. But the user hasn't tried that yet. Let me check the previous steps.

In the Bedchamber (step 37), the exits are north, south, and west. The user has been going south and west, but not north. Maybe going north from the Bedchamber is the way to go. That would be the next step to break the loop and reach the laundromat.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is stuck in a loop between the Playroom and Sauna, going back and forth between them. The goal is to venture south, take a trip south, recover the shadfly from the laundromat, and win.

The user is in the Sauna again (step 44). Previous actions led them back to the same places. They need to find a way to get to the laundromat. The initial steps required going south from the Bedchamber, but maybe the laundromat is connected through another exit.

In the Playroom, there's an open hatch east and a passageway west. The Sauna has a board that might be relevant, but it's empty. The user needs to break the loop.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Basement now. The goal is to venture south, take a trip south, recover the shadfly from the laundromat, and win. So far, the user has been moving between rooms without reaching the laundromat. The laundromat isn't mentioned in the current rooms, so maybe it's a different area.

The user is in the Basement (step 56). The exits are east and south. The previous actions led them back to the same places. They need to find a way to get to the laundromat. The initial steps required going south from the Bedchamber, but maybe the laundromat is connected through another exit.

In the Basement, there's an exit to the east and south. The user needs to go south to continue their journey. The next step should be to go south from the Basement to reach the laundromat. So the next action is to go south.

FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Cookery and Shower rooms. The goal is to venture south, take a trip south, recover the shadfly from the laundromat, and win. So far, the user has been moving between these rooms without reaching the laundromat. The laundromat isn't mentioned in the current rooms, so maybe it's a different area.

The user is in the Shower again (step 76). The exits are east and north. The previous actions led them back to the same places. They need to find a way to get to the laundromat. The initial steps required going south from the Bedchamber, but maybe the laundromat is connected through another exit.

In the Shower, there's an exit to the east. The user needs to go east to continue their journey. The next step should be to go east from the Shower to reach the laundromat. So the next action is to go east.

Well, here we are in the kitchenette.

A locked freezer is here. You can make out a fridge. The fridge is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You can make out a chair. The chair is usual. The chair appears to be empty. Hm. Oh well You make out a rack. The rack appears to be empty. Hopefully, this discovery doesn't ruin your TextWorld experience!

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.
