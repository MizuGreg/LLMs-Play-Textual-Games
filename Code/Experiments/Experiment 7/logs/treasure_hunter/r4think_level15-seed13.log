Welcome to TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First, it would be a great idea if you could attempt to head south. With that done, make an effort to take a trip west. Then, travel south. With that over with, make an effort to venture east. And then, move east. Then, pick-up the passkey from the floor of the bar. That's it!

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they need to follow specific steps to reach the passkey in the bar. The goal is to go south, then west, then south again, then east, then east again, and finally pick up the passkey.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Laundromat again after going back and forth between the Chamber and Laundromat. They've already done the initial steps: went south from Cookhouse, west to Studio, south to Scullery, east to Chamber, then west back to Chamber, and east back to Laundromat. They're stuck in a loop between Chamber and Laundromat.

The next step according to the original instructions was to go east again from the Chamber to reach the bar. But since the user is looping, they need to find a different action. Maybe instead of "go east" again, they should check if there's another way. But the available exits in the Laundromat are north, south, west, and east. The Chamber has exits north, south, east. Wait, maybe the user needs to go north from Laundromat instead of east? Let me check the previous steps.

Wait, the original plan was after going east from the Chamber, they should go east again to reach the bar. But in the current state, they're in Laundromat, which is part of the loop. Maybe the correct path is to go north from Laundromat to Chamber, then east to reach the bar. But the user has already tried that. Alternatively, maybe the passkey is in the bar, and the user needs to go east from the Chamber to the bar. But the user is stuck in a loop, so they need to find a different action. Perhaps the correct next step is to go north from Laundromat to Chamber, then east to the bar. But the user is repeating the same actions. So the next action should be to go north from Laundromat instead of east.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is stuck in a loop between the Cookhouse and Studio. The goal is to reach the bar to pick up the passkey. The original plan was to go south, west, south, east, east, then get the passkey. But the user is repeatedly going between these rooms without progress.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Studio again after trying to go east, which isn't possible. The exits here are north, south, and west. The previous steps had the user go south to Cookhouse, then west to Studio, then south again to Scullery, but that's not part of the current loop. Now, the user is stuck in a cycle between Studio and Cookhouse.

The next step should be to find another way out. Since going east from Studio isn't possible, maybe the user needs to go west from Studio to Cookhouse again. But that's what they've been doing. Wait, the original instruction said after going east from the Chamber, they should go east again to reach the bar. Maybe the user hasn't reached the bar yet. But in the current state, they're in Studio, which is part of the loop. Perhaps the correct action is to go west from Studio to Cookhouse, then south to the bar. But the user has already tried that. Alternatively, maybe the passkey is in the bar, and the user needs to find another exit. But the game might require a different approach. Since the user is in a loop, the next action should be to go west again, but the system says "You can't go that way." Wait, no, in the last attempt, the user tried to go east from Studio and was blocked. So maybe the correct next step is to go west from Studio to Cookhouse, then south to the bar. But the user is stuck in a loop, so they need to find a different action. Maybe the answer is to go north from Studio, but that's not part of the original plan. Alternatively, check if there's a hidden action, like opening the toolbox or bureau. But the original goal was to pick up the passkey from the bar. So the user needs to get to the bar. The correct path is probably to go west from the Chamber to the bar, but the user is stuck in a loop. The next action should be to go west from Studio to Cookhouse, then south to the bar. But the user is in Studio, so the next command is go west. But the system might not allow that. Wait, in the current state, the user is in Studio, and the exits are north, south, west. So going west would take them to Cookhouse. Then from Cookhouse, go south to the bar. But the user has already done that. Maybe the passkey is in the bar, and the user needs to go south from Cookhouse. But the user is in Studio again. So the next action is go west to Cookhouse, then south to the bar. But the user is stuck in a loop, so the answer is to go west again.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between several rooms: Studio, Scullery, Chamber, Laundromat, and back to Studio. The goal is to pick up the passkey from the bar. The original plan was to go south, west, south, east, east, then get the passkey. But the user is repeatedly moving between these rooms without reaching the bar.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Chamber again. The exits here are east, north, south. The passkey is supposed to be in the bar, which is probably accessible from the Cookhouse south exit. But the user has already tried that path. The loop suggests that the user is not progressing towards the bar. The next step should be to go east from the Chamber to reach the Laundromat, then find another exit. But the user has already done that. Maybe the correct action is to go north from the Chamber to the Studio, then west to the Cookhouse, and finally south to the bar. However, the user is stuck in a loop, so they need to try a different action. The previous actions didn't work, so the next command should be different. Perhaps go north from the Chamber to the Studio, then west to the Cookhouse, then south to the bar. But the user is in the Chamber, so the next command is go east.

Look over there! a case. You look around you, at all the containers and supporters, doors and objects, and you think to yourself. Why? Why Textworld? You can see a fridge. The fridge is empty! What a waste of a day!

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.
