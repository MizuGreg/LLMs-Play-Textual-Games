Welcome to TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First, it would be a great idea if you could attempt to travel north. And then, pick up the passkey from the floor of the cookery. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Studio =-
This might come as a shock to you, but you've just entered a studio.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Cookery =-
You arrive in a cookery. A normal kind of place. You can barely contain your excitement.



You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a passkey on the floor.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text-based game where they need to reach the goal. The current location is the Cookery, and there's a passkey on the floor. The previous action was going north, which led them here.

First, the goal is to pick up the passkey from the cookery floor and then exit. The user has already moved north into the cookery. Now, they need to pick up the passkey. The next logical step is to pick it up. But the user's last action was going north, and the current location is cookery. The prompt says to pick up the passkey first. So the next action should be to pick up the passkey. Then, after that, they might need to go south to exit. But according to the instructions, the next step is to pick up the passkey. So the correct command here is to pick up the passkey.
</think>pick up passkey
