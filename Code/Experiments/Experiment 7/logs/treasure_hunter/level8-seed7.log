Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First stop, take a trip west. And then, attempt to travel south. Once you accomplish that, make an attempt to go to the east. And then, retrieve the key from the floor of the dish-pit. Got that? Good!

-= Washroom =-
Guess what, you are in a place we're calling a washroom.



You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

-= Parlor =-
You've entered a parlor.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text-based game where they need to follow specific steps. The initial task was to go west, then south, then east, and finally retrieve a key from the dish-pit.

First, the user started by going west from the washroom into the parlor. Now, in the parlor, they can go east or south. The next step according to the original plan was to go south after going west. But the user has already gone west, so the next logical step is to go south as per the initial instructions.

Looking at the current location (parlor), the exits are east and south. The user needs to go south next. But wait, the original task said after going west, attempt to travel south. So after west, go south. Then east, then get the key. So the next action should be south. But the user is in the parlor, and the previous action was west. So the next step is to go south. However, the user might be in a loop if they keep going back. But since the parlor has a south exit, that's the next step. The key is in the dish-pit, which might be in a different area. So the next action is to go south.

-= Lounge =-
You've just sauntered into a lounge.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north.

There is a keycard on the floor.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they need to follow specific steps. The goal is to first go west, then south, then east, and finally retrieve the key from the dish-pit. 

Looking at the current scenario, the user is in the Lounge. The previous actions were going west, then south. Now, they need to go east. But the prompt says to retrieve the key from the floor of the dish-pit. Wait, the current location is the Lounge, and there's a keycard on the floor here. But the task mentions the dish-pit. Maybe the dish-pit is another room?

Wait, the initial task said: "First stop, take a trip west. And then, attempt to travel south. Once you accomplish that, make an attempt to go to the east. And then, retrieve the key from the floor of the dish-pit."

So after going west, south, east, then get the key from the dish-pit. But in the current location (Lounge), there's a keycard on the floor. Maybe that's the key? Or is the dish-pit a different room? Maybe the key is in the Lounge, but the task mentions the dish-pit. Maybe there's a confusion here.

But according to the latest prompt, the user is in the Lounge, and there's a keycard on the floor. So maybe that's the key they need to pick up. The task says to retrieve the key from the dish-pit, but perhaps the dish-pit is the Lounge? Or maybe the key is here, and the dish-pit is another room. But the user hasn't reached the dish-pit yet.

Wait, the initial steps were: go west (from Washroom to Parlor), then south (to Lounge). Then the next step was to go east. So after going east, they would be in another room. But the current location is the Lounge, and the key is here. So maybe the key is in the Lounge, and the dish-pit is a misdirection, or maybe the key is in the dish-pit, but the user is in the Lounge. So perhaps the key is here, and the user needs to pick it up.

So the next step is to pick up the keycard. But the task says to retrieve the key from the dish-pit. But maybe the key is here. So the user should take the keycard. But the user's next action should be to pick it up. However, the previous steps were moving around, and now they need to collect the key. So the next action is to take the keycard from the floor.
