You are now playing a exciting game of TextWorld! First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to open the hatch inside the parlor. After that, attempt to go east. And then, ensure that the gate is open. And then, try to travel north. After that, open the portal. After that, make an effort to venture north. After that, make an attempt to head west. Following that, go to the north. Okay, and then, take a trip east. Next, recover the butterfly from the box in the workshop. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Parlor =-
You arrive in a parlor. A normal one.

If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a trunk.

There is a closed hatch leading east. There is an open door leading west.

There is a pillow on the floor.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is trying to play a text-based game called TextWorld. Their goal is to open a hatch in the parlor, go east, open a gate, travel north, open a portal, go north again, west, north, east, recover a butterfly from a box in the workshop, and win.

The user has been trying to open the hatch east, but the game keeps saying they have to open the hatch first before going east. They tried "open hatch east" multiple times, but the game is not recognizing it. Then they tried "go east" but the game says the hatch must be opened first. So the user is stuck in a loop where they can't proceed because the hatch isn't open.

Now, the user is asking for help. The assistant needs to break the loop by suggesting a different action. The previous actions were "open hatch east" and "go east", but the game isn't accepting them. Maybe the correct command is "open the hatch" instead of "open hatch east"? Or perhaps "open hatch" without specifying east? Wait, the initial instruction was to open the hatch inside the parlor, which is leading east. So the correct command is "open hatch east", but the game is not recognizing it. Maybe the game expects "open hatch" without the direction? Or maybe the user needs to use a synonym like "open the hatch" instead of "open hatch".

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to first open the hatch, then go east. But the game is not allowing them to go east until the hatch is open. So the correct sequence is: open the hatch, then go east. But the user is trying to go east first, which is invalid. So the next step is to open the hatch again, but the game is not accepting it. Maybe the user needs to use a different phrasing, like "open the hatch" instead of "open hatch east". Let me check the game's possible commands. In TextWorld, commands are usually concise, so "open hatch" might be the correct command. The initial prompt said there's a closed hatch leading east, so the correct action is "open hatch", which would open it, then "go east" would be possible. So the next action should be "open hatch" instead of "open hatch east".

Okay, let's break this down. The user is stuck in a loop where they keep trying to open the gate north but the game isn't recognizing it. The goal is to open the hatch in the parlor, go east, open the gate, go north, open the portal, etc. So far, they opened the hatch, went east to the canteen, tried to open the gate north but failed. Now they're repeating the same actions.

First step: The goal is to open the hatch, go east, open the gate, go north, open the portal, etc. So far, they've opened the hatch and moved east. Now they need to open the gate north.

Second step: Past actions include opening the hatch and going east. The next step was trying to open the gate, but the game says it's not allowed yet. So the next step is to open the gate.

Third step: The user is looping between trying to open the gate and being told to do so first. The problem is that the game might not be recognizing the command "open gate north" correctly. Maybe the correct command is "open the gate" or "open gate" without specifying north. Alternatively, maybe the gate is named differently. Since the game didn't accept "open gate north" before, perhaps the correct command is "open gate" or "open the gate".

Finally, the next action should be to open the gate, using a different phrasing if needed. Since the previous attempts with "open gate north" failed, maybe "open gate" is the correct command.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through a text-based game, following a specific sequence of actions. The main goal is to open various doors and portals, eventually recovering a butterfly from a workshop.

Looking at the current situation, the user is in a cubicle with a closed portal north and an open gate south. They tried to open the portal north but the game keeps saying they need to open it first. They've been repeating "open portal north" and "go north", which isn't working.

First step: The goal is to open the hatch in the parlor, go east, open the gate, go north, open the portal, etc. So far, they've opened the hatch, went east to the canteen, opened the gate, went north to the cubicle. Now they need to open the portal north.

Second step: Past actions include opening the hatch, going east, opening the gate, and now trying to open the portal. The next step should be opening the portal, but the game isn't accepting "open portal north". Maybe the correct command is "open the portal" or "open portal" without the direction.

Third step: The user is in a loop, repeatedly trying to open the portal without success. The previous actions didn't progress, so the command needs to be different. Perhaps using "open portal" instead of "open portal north" or "the portal".

Finally, the next action should be to open the portal, using a different phrasing if necessary. Since "open portal north" isn't working, maybe "open portal" is the correct command.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Office and Chamber areas. They keep trying to open gateways and go north/south, but the game isn't recognizing their commands. The goal is to recover the butterfly from the workshop.

First, the goal steps: Open hatch, go east, open gate, go north, open portal, go north, open gateway, etc. So far, they've opened the hatch, gone east, opened the gate, went north to the cubicle, opened the portal, went north to the cellar, west to the office, and now back to the chamber.

Second, past actions: They've been oscillating between the Office and Chamber, trying to open gateways. The next step should be to find the workshop and get the butterfly.

Third, the loop is between Office and Chamber. The previous actions didn't progress because they're stuck in a cycle. The correct action might be to look for the workshop instead of continuing to open gateways. Maybe the workshop is in the east passageway from the Office.

Finally, the next action should be to go east from the Office to reach the workshop.

-= Workshop =-
You've just shown up in a workshop.

You can see a box. The box contains a butterfly. You make out a locker. You can see a portmanteau.

You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.
