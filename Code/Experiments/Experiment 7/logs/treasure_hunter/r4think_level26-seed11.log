It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! First step, try to travel north. Following that, pick up the formless passkey from the floor of the basement. After stealing the formless passkey, try to venture south. With that accomplished, assure that the formless passageway is unlocked. If you have unlocked the formless passageway, open the formless passageway. And then, move east. With that accomplished, make an effort to venture east. Then, go to the south. And then, make an attempt to move east. And then, make an attempt to go east. That done, attempt to take a trip north. If you can get through with that, pick up the keyboard from the floor of the workshop. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Shower =-
You've entered a shower.

You see a board. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. Silly board, silly, empty, good for nothing board.

There is a closed formless passageway leading east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through this text-based game. The goal is to pick up the keyboard from the workshop and win. Let me recap the steps they've taken so far.

First, they started in the shower, went north to the basement. Then they picked up the formless passkey, went south back to the shower. Then they tried to unlock the formless passageway, which they did. Then they tried to go east but were told to open it first. They opened it, so now they should be able to go east into the passageway.

Now, the next steps according to the initial plan were to move east, then south, then east again, then north to get to the workshop. But the user is stuck again because after opening the passageway, they need to go east into it. Once in the passageway, they can go south to reach the workshop. Then, after getting the keyboard, they win.

Wait, the user just opened the formless passageway. The next command should be to go east into the passageway. Then, from there, go south to the workshop. Then pick up the keyboard. So the next action is to go east through the now-open passageway. The user might have tried going east before opening it, so now that it's open, they need to proceed.

-= Study =-
You've entered a study. You begin to take stock of what's here.



There is an open formless passageway leading west. There is an open door leading east.

-= Bedroom =-
You arrive in a bedroom. An ordinary one.

You see a dresser. The dresser is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! Were you looking for a shelf? Because look over there, it's a shelf. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You scan the room for a recliner, and you find a recliner. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a recliner, go to TextWorld. The recliner is ordinary. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

There is an open gate leading north. There is an open door leading west. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.



>                                                                                                                                -= Bedroom =-0/9

You're now in an attic.

You make out a crate! Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You can see a stand. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The stand is normal. However, the stand, like an empty stand, has nothing on it. Hopefully, this discovery doesn't ruin your TextWorld experience! You can make out a counter. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the counter.

There is an open portal leading north. There is an open gate leading south. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east.

-= Vault =-
You've just shown up in a vault.

You make out an opened locker close by. The locker is empty! What a waste of a day!

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is trying to win the game by following specific steps. The goal is to pick up the keyboard from the workshop and then win. Let me check where they are now.

Previously, they went from the shower to the basement, picked up the passkey, unlocked the passageway, and went east into the study. Then they went east again to the bedroom, then north to the attic, and now east again to the vault. Wait, but the original plan was to go east through the formless passageway, then south to the workshop. But maybe they got lost in the other areas.

Looking at the current location: Vault. The exits are east, south, and west. The user needs to get back to the workshop. Maybe they need to go west from the vault back through the vault's west entrance, then south to the basement, then north to the shower, then east to the study, then east again to the workshop. But the user might have missed the correct path.

Wait, the initial plan after opening the passageway was to go east into the passageway, then south to the workshop. But in the current path, they went east from the attic to the vault, which is a different route. So maybe they need to find another way back. The user might be in a loop between the attic and vault. The next step should be to go west from the vault to get back to the attic, then find the correct path to the workshop. But the user needs to avoid repeating actions. So instead of going east again, maybe go west from the vault, then south to the basement, then north to the shower, then east to the study, then east to the workshop. But the user has to make sure they follow the correct sequence without getting stuck.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Studio and Steam Room. The goal is to get to the workshop to pick up the keyboard. So far, they've gone through various rooms but haven't found the workshop yet. The correct path should be from the Studio east to the workshop. But since they're looping between Studio and Steam Room, they need to find another way. Maybe they need to go south from the Studio through the portal to reach the workshop. Let me check the previous steps. The user was in the Steam Room, went west back to the Studio. Now, instead of going east again, they should try going south from the Studio to reach the workshop.

-= Attic =-
You're now in an attic.

You make out a crate! Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You can see a stand. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The stand is normal. However, the stand, like an empty stand, has nothing on it. Hopefully, this discovery doesn't ruin your TextWorld experience! You can make out a counter. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the counter.

There is an open portal leading north. There is an open gate leading south. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Attic and Vault. The goal is to get to the workshop to pick up the keyboard. So far, they've tried going east and west multiple times but haven't found the workshop. The correct path should be from the Vault east to the workshop. But since they're looping, they need to find another way. Maybe they need to go south from the Vault to the basement again, then north to the shower, then east to the study, and finally east to the workshop. But the user has to avoid repeating actions. So instead of going west again, they should try going south from the Vault.

You've just shown up in a vault.

You make out an opened locker close by. The locker is empty! What a waste of a day!

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

You're now in an attic.

You make out a crate! Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You can see a stand. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The stand is normal. However, the stand, like an empty stand, has nothing on it. Hopefully, this discovery doesn't ruin your TextWorld experience! You can make out a counter. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the counter.

There is an open portal leading north. There is an open gate leading south. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

However, the stand, like an empty stand, has nothing on it. Hopefully, this discovery doesn't ruin your TextWorld experience! You can make out a counter. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the counter.

There is an open portal leading north. There is an open gate leading south. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east.

You make out an opened locker close by. The locker is empty! What a waste of a day!

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

-= Cubicle =-
This is going to sound unbelievable, but you've just entered a cubicle. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You make out a locked box.

There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Vault =-
You've just shown up in a vault.

You make out an opened locker close by. The locker is empty! What a waste of a day!

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Attic =-
You're now in an attic.

You make out a crate! Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You can see a stand. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The stand is normal. However, the stand, like an empty stand, has nothing on it. Hopefully, this discovery doesn't ruin your TextWorld experience! You can make out a counter. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the counter.

There is an open portal leading north. There is an open gate leading south. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east.
