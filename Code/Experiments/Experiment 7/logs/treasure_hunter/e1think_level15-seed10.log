It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First off, try to go east. After that, ensure that the portal inside the spare room is open. After that, venture north. Then, doublecheck that the gate is open. After that, make an effort to go to the east. Then, recover the stick of butter from the floor of the cubicle. Got that? Good!

-= Bedchamber =-
You are in a bedchamber. A normal one.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Spare Room =-
You arrive in a spare room. A standard kind of place.

You make out a toolbox. The toolbox is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a coffer. Oh, great. Here's a display. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. This always happens!

There is a closed portal leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

There is a passkey on the floor.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The user is in the Spare Room, and the goal is to follow the steps given in the initial instruction. The first step was to go east from the Bedchamber, which they did. Now, they're in the Spare Room, and the next step according to the original plan was to ensure the portal inside the spare room is open. But the current description says there's a closed portal leading north. So the next action should be to open that portal.

Wait, but how do you open it? The user found a passkey on the floor. Maybe using the passkey is necessary. The original instructions mention recovering the stick of butter from the cubicle, but that's later. Right now, the immediate task is to open the north portal. The passkey might be needed for that. So the user needs to pick up the passkey first, then use it on the portal. But the current step is to check if the portal is open. Since it's closed, the user needs to find a way to open it. The passkey is on the floor, so the next step is to pick it up. Then, maybe use it on the portal. But the original instruction said to ensure the portal is open. So maybe the correct sequence is: pick up the passkey, then use it to open the north portal. But the user hasn't done that yet. The current location is the Spare Room, and the next step is to open the portal. So the next action should be to take the passkey. Then, use it to open the portal. But the user's next command should be to take the passkey first. Wait, the user is in the Spare Room, and the passkey is on the floor. So the first action here is to take the passkey. Then, use it to open the portal. But the original plan said to check the portal's status. But since it's closed, the user needs to open it. So the next step is to take the passkey. Then, use it on the portal. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action is to take the passkey.
