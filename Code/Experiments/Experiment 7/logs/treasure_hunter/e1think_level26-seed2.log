Welcome to another exciting episode of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First thing I need you to do is to try to go east. And then, make an effort to go south. Once you do that, try to go to the west. Then, make an effort to go to the south. With that over with, make an effort to travel west. And then, take a trip south. Following that, attempt to take a trip west. After that, attempt to go south. Once you get through with that, attempt to go to the east. And then, go to the east. With that accomplished, venture north. That done, pick-up the passkey from the floor of the spare room. That's it!

-= Parlor =-
You've entered a parlor.

You can see a stand. The stand is ordinary. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

There is an unblocked exit to the east.

-= Shower =-
You find yourself in a shower. An ordinary one.

You make out a locked safe close by. You make out a rack. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open passageway leading south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text-based game where they need to follow a specific sequence of movements and collect a passkey. The initial instructions mention going east, then south, west, south, west, south, east, east, north, and then picking up the passkey from the spare room.

Looking at the current environment, the user is in the Shower area. They can go south, west, or there's a locked safe and a rack. The previous action was going east from the Parlor to the Shower. Now, the next step according to the initial instructions is to go south. But the user has to make sure they follow the exact steps without getting stuck in a loop.

Wait, the user's goal is to collect the passkey from the spare room. The current location is the Shower. The next step in the sequence is to go south from the Shower. But the user needs to check if that's the right path. The initial instructions said after going east, then south, west, etc. So after the first east to Shower, the next step is south. But the user is already in the Shower, so going south would be the next step. However, the user might be in a loop if they keep moving back and forth. But according to the instructions, they need to follow the sequence: east, south, west, south, west, south, east, east, north, then collect the key.

So the next action after arriving in the Shower should be to go south. But the user has to make sure they don't repeat actions that don't progress. Since the initial steps require moving south from the Shower, that's the next step. The user should go south from the Shower. Then, after that, the next steps would be west, south, etc. So the next command is go south.

You find yourself in a sauna.



There is an open passageway leading north. There is an open portal leading west.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in TextWorld. The goal is to pick up the passkey from the spare room. Let me recap the steps they've taken so far.

First, they started in the Parlor, went east to the Shower. Then from the Shower, they went south to the Sauna. Now, in the Sauna, they can go north or west. The previous actions were going east, then south, then south again. Wait, the user's last action was "go south" from the Sauna. Wait, no, the user's last action was "go south" from the Shower to the Sauna. Wait, the history shows:

First move: go east (from Parlor to Shower)
Second move: go south (from Shower to Sauna)
Now, in the Sauna, the available exits are north and west. The user's next action would be to go west or north. But according to the initial instructions, the user was supposed to follow a sequence: go east, south, west, south, west, south, east, east, then north to get to the spare room.

Wait, maybe the user is getting confused with the directions. Let me check the initial instructions again. The user was told to: go east, then south, then west, then south, then west, then south, then east, then east, then north to get to the spare room. So after the initial steps, they need to navigate through these directions.

But in the current scenario, they're in the Sauna. The previous steps were: Parlor -> Shower (east), then Shower -> Sauna (south). Now, the next step according to the initial plan is to go west. But in the Sauna, there's an open passageway leading north and a portal west. So going west from Sauna would be the next step. But the user might be stuck in a loop if they keep going back and forth. However, the user's last action was going south to the Sauna, so the next step should be west. But the user's previous action was going south, so maybe they need to go west now. But the user's last move was "go south" from the Shower to Sauna. So the next step is to go west from Sauna. But the user's next action would be "go west". However, the user's last action was "go south", so maybe they need to check if that's the correct direction. Alternatively, maybe they need to go north first. Wait, the initial plan was to go east, south, west, south, west, south, east, east, north. So after the first south (to Sauna), the next step is west. So from Sauna, go west. Then from there, maybe south again. But the user needs to make sure they're not looping. So the next action should be "go west" from Sauna. But the user's last action was "go south", so that's the correct next step. So the answer is "go west".

-= Laundromat =-
You've just shown up in a laundromat.



There is an open portal leading east. There is an open gate leading south.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in TextWorld, following a specific sequence of directions. The goal is to eventually pick up the passkey from the spare room.

First, I need to recap the game's objective. The user has to go east, then south, west, south, west, south, east, east, then north to get the passkey. So far, the user has moved east from the parlor to the shower, then south to the sauna, then west to the laundromat. 

Now, the current room is the laundromat. The next step in the sequence is to go south. But the laundromat has an open gate leading south. So the next action should be to go south. However, I need to check if there's any loop or if the same action has been repeated. The previous steps were east, south, west, south, west, south, east, east, north. Wait, the user is at laundromat, which is step 4 (0/4). The next step according to the original instructions is to go south again. But maybe the user is getting stuck in a loop here. However, the laundromat's south gate is open, so going south should be valid. The next room after laundromat south would be the next in the sequence. So the next action is go south.

-= Bar =-
You arrive in a bar. A standard one.

You can make out a recliner. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.

There is an open gate leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in TextWorld, following a specific sequence of directions. The goal is to eventually pick up the passkey from the spare room.

First, I need to recall the initial instructions. The user was told to go east, then south, west, south, west, south, east, east, then north to get to the spare room where the passkey is. So far, the user has moved through the Parlor → Shower → Sauna → Laundromat → Bar. The current room is the Bar.

Looking at the current room (Bar), the exits are north, east, south, and west. The user's next step according to the initial plan was to go south after the Bar. But the user might be stuck in a loop if they keep moving between rooms without making progress towards the passkey. However, the user's previous action was "go south" from the Bar, which led them to the current room. Wait, no—the user is in the Bar now, and the next step would be to follow the initial plan's instructions.

Wait, the initial plan said after the Bar, the next step was to go south, then west, etc. But in the Bar, the user can go north, east, south, or west. The user's next action should be to go south as per the initial instructions. However, the user might be repeating actions without progress. But according to the game's current state, the user is in the Bar, and the next step in the sequence is to go south. So the correct next action is "go south" again. But the user might be in a loop if moving south doesn't lead them closer. However, based on the initial plan, the user needs to proceed step by step. Therefore, the next action is "go south".

-= Spare Room =-
I never took you for the sort of person who would show up in a spare room, but I guess I was wrong.



There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

There is a passkey on the floor.

Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game where they have to navigate through different rooms and eventually pick up a passkey from the spare room. The goal seems to be to collect the passkey and escape or complete the game.

Looking at the history of commands, the user has been moving through various rooms: starting in the parlor, then the shower, sauna, laundromat, bar, and now the spare room. The last room is the spare room where the passkey is on the floor. The user's previous action was "go south" which led them to the spare room. Now, in the spare room, they need to pick up the passkey.

The instructions mention that once you get through with the previous steps (which involved moving in certain directions), you need to pick up the passkey from the floor of the spare room. So the next logical step is to pick up the passkey. The user hasn't done that yet. The current room is the spare room, and the passkey is there. So the correct action would be to take the passkey. The user's previous actions have been moving around, but now they need to interact with the passkey. The command should be "take passkey" or something similar. But in the game's context, maybe the exact command is "get passkey" or "pick up passkey". Since the user is supposed to output the command, the correct next step is to take the passkey from the floor.
</think>take passkey
