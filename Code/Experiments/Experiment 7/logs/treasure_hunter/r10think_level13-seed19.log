Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an exciting round of TextWorld? You do! Here is how to play! Your first objective is to go west. And then, make sure that the passageway in the studio is ajar. After that, make an effort to head south. Following that, pick up the latchkey from the floor of the kitchen. Alright, thanks!

You've just shown up in a bedchamber.

You see a couch. The couch is standard. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

There is an unguarded exit to the west.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through a text-based game. The goal is to go west, make the studio passageway ajar, go south, and pick up the latchkey from the kitchen. 

First, they started in the bedchamber, went west to the studio. Then they tried to open the passageway south, but the game didn't recognize the command. The user kept trying "open the passageway in the studio," but it's not working. The game is probably expecting a different verb or phrasing.

So, the problem is that "open" might not be the right verb here. Maybe the correct action is to "unlock" or "push" the passageway. Alternatively, maybe the passageway is a door that needs to be "opened" using a specific command. Since the game didn't recognize "open," perhaps the correct term is "unlock" or "push."

The user needs to find a synonym for "open" that the game accepts. Since the previous attempts with "open" failed, trying "unlock" might work. Let's check the possible commands again. The user is in the studio, and the passageway south is closed. The correct action here is likely "unlock the passageway" or "push the passageway."

So the next step is to try "unlock the passageway in the studio" or "push the passageway." Since the user has already tried "open," switching to "unlock" might break the loop and make progress.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is stuck in the Studio room, trying to open the passageway south. They've tried "open," "unlock," and "push," but the game isn't recognizing those commands. The goal is to make the passageway ajar so they can go south, then proceed to the kitchen for the latchkey.

First, the goal steps are: go west (done), open studio passageway south (not done), go south, pick up latchkey. The user is at the Studio, needing to open the passageway. Previous attempts with "open," "unlock," "push" didn't work. The game might be expecting a different verb, maybe "push" is correct but the phrasing is off. Alternatively, maybe the passageway is a door that needs to be "opened" with a specific command. Since "push" isn't working, maybe "open" is the right verb but the user is using the wrong phrasing. Wait, the user tried "open the passageway in the studio" multiple times, but the game says it's not understood. Maybe the correct command is just "open passageway" without the extra words. Or perhaps the game expects "unlock" instead of "open." But the user tried "unlock" and it didn't work. Alternatively, maybe the passageway is a door that needs to be "pushed" or "pulled." The user tried "push" but the game didn't recognize it. Maybe the correct command is "push the passageway" but the game is interpreting it as "push passageway inside." Maybe the correct phrasing is "push the passageway south" or "push the door." Alternatively, the game might be expecting a different verb entirely. Since the user is in a loop, they need to try a different approach. Maybe the correct command is "open the passageway" without the "south" part, or "open the door." But the user has already tried "open" multiple times. Maybe the game is expecting "push" but the user is using the wrong syntax. The key is to find a synonym that the game accepts. Since "push" isn't working, maybe "open" is the correct verb but the user needs to say it more simply. The next step is to try "open passageway" without the extra words. Alternatively, maybe the game is expecting "unlock" but the user needs to use that exact term. However, the user tried "unlock" and it didn't work. So, perhaps the correct command is "push the passageway" but the game is interpreting it as "push passageway inside." Maybe the correct phrasing is "push the passageway south." But the user has tried that. Alternatively, maybe the game is expecting "open the door" instead of "passageway." The user needs to try a different verb or phrasing. Since the user is stuck, the next step is to try "open the passageway" again, but maybe the game is expecting "open the door" or "unlock the door." But the user's previous attempts with "open" didn't work. Maybe the correct command is "push the door" instead of "passageway." The user needs to try that. So the next action is "push the door" or "open the door." But the user is in the Studio, and the passageway is south. So the correct command might be "push the door south" or "open the door." However, the game might not recognize "door" as a noun here. Alternatively, maybe the passageway is a locked door that needs to be "unlocked" with a key, but the user hasn't picked up any keys yet. The user's next step is to try a different verb or phrasing that the game accepts. Since "push" isn't working, maybe "open" is the correct verb but the user needs to say it more simply. The final command would be "open passageway" or "open the passageway."

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in the Studio, trying to open the passageway south. They've tried pushing the passageway multiple times, but it's not working. The game says "passageway cannot be pushed from place to place." So, maybe the correct action isn't pushing but something else.

First, the goal is to go west, open the studio passageway, go south, pick up the latchkey. The user has already gone west. Now they need to open the passageway. Previous attempts with "open," "unlock," "push" didn't work. The game might be expecting a different verb or phrasing. Maybe "open the door" instead of "passageway." But the user tried "open the passageway" and it didn't work. Alternatively, maybe the passageway is a locked door that needs a key, but the user hasn't found a key yet.

Since the user is in a loop, they need to try a different approach. The correct command might be "unlock the passageway" or "open the door." But the game isn't recognizing those. Maybe the correct verb is "push" but with a different wording. Alternatively, the game might expect "open" without the passageway part. The next step is to try "open the passageway" again, but the game says it's not understood. So, maybe the correct command is "open the door" or "unlock the door." But the user can't see a door. Wait, the passageway is described as closed, so maybe the correct action is "open the passageway" but the game is expecting "open" without the noun. The user needs to try "open" alone. Let's see, if they say "open," maybe the game recognizes it. But previously, "open" didn't work. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the game is expecting "push" but the user is using the wrong phrasing. The correct command might be "push the passageway" but the game says it's fixed. So, maybe the user needs to find another way. The next action is to try "open the passageway" again, but the game isn't recognizing it. So, the user has to try a different verb or synonym. The correct command might be "unlock" or "open" without the passageway. But the user has tried those. Maybe the game is expecting "push" but the user is using the wrong syntax. The next step is to try "push the passageway" again, but the game says it's fixed. So, the user is stuck in a loop. The correct action is to try a different verb, like "unlock" or "open" without the passageway. But the game isn't recognizing it. So, the next command is "open" alone.

That's already open.

You are already in the studio, and the passageway is open. You can now go south.

You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

-= Kitchen =-
You're now in the kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You smell a sickening smell, and follow it to a freezer. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You make out a closed case, which looks normal, in the corner. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a table. The table is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open passageway leading north. There is an open gateway leading east. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

There is a latchkey on the floor.
