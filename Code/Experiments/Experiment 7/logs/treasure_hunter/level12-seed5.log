Welcome to another fast paced session of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First thing I need you to do is to go west. Next, go to the south. After that, pick-up the chocolate bar from the floor of the chamber. That's it!

-= Study =-
You are in a study. A typical kind of place.



There is an unblocked exit to the south. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

>                                                                                                                                -= Study =-0/1

-= Kitchenette =-
I just think it's great that you've just entered a kitchenette.

You can see a freezer.

There is an open hatch leading north. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Chamber =-
You make another one of your grand eccentric entrances into a chamber.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the north.

There is a chocolate bar on the floor.
