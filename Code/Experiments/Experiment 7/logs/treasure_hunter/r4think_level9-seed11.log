You are now playing a life changing game of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. Your first objective is to attempt to move north. And then, make an effort to venture north. After that, make an effort to go to the east. After that, go to the south. Following that, pick-up the passkey from the floor of the chamber. And once you've done that, you win!

You find yourself in a studio.



There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and collect a passkey. The current goal is to move north, then north again, then east, south, pick up the passkey, and win.

Looking at the history, the user started in the studio, went north to the laundromat, then north again to the shower, then south back to the laundromat. Now they're back in the laundromat again. The next step according to the original plan was to go east, but the user hasn't done that yet. However, the current room is the laundromat, and the previous action was going south, which brought them back. The user might be stuck in a loop between the laundromat and shower.

The next step should be to go east from the shower, but since they're in the laundromat now, maybe they need to check if there's an east exit here. But the laundromat's description says to go north or south. Wait, the original plan was after going north (to laundromat), then north again (to shower), then south (back to laundromat), then east. But the laundromat doesn't have an east exit mentioned. So maybe the user needs to go east from the shower, but they were in the shower, then went south back to laundromat. Now they're in laundromat again. Maybe the correct path is from the laundromat, go north again to shower, then east. But the user needs to pick up the passkey in the chamber. Wait, the original instructions say after going south, pick up the passkey from the floor of the chamber. So maybe the chamber is the laundromat? Or another room?

Wait, the initial task was: move north (studio to laundromat), then north again (laundromat to shower), then east (from shower?), then south (back to laundromat?), then pick up passkey. But the passkey is in the chamber. Maybe the laundromat is the chamber? Or maybe the shower is the chamber? The user needs to find the passkey in the chamber. The current room is laundromat, which has a towel on the floor. The passkey isn't here. So maybe the user needs to go east from the shower, which is the next step. But in the shower room, the exits are east and south. So after being in the shower, go east. Then, from there, maybe go south to laundromat, then pick up the passkey. But the user is currently in laundromat again. So the next step should be to go north again to shower, then east. But the user has to make sure not to loop. Since they were in laundromat, maybe the correct next step is to go east, but if that's not possible, then north. But the laundromat's description says to go north or south. So perhaps the user needs to go north again to shower, then east. Then, after that, go south to laundromat, pick up the passkey. But the passkey is in the chamber, which might be the laundromat. So the user needs to check if the passkey is in the laundromat. But in the laundromat, there's a towel on the floor. So maybe the passkey is in the shower? Or another room. The user needs to follow the steps: after going south, pick up the passkey. So maybe after going south from the shower to laundromat, the passkey is there. But the user hasn't picked it up yet. So the next action should be to pick up the passkey. But the user is in laundromat, and the passkey is on the floor. So the correct next step is to pick up the passkey. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action is to pick up the passkey. But the user's previous actions were moving around, and now they need to collect the passkey. So the next command should be to pick up the passkey.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to navigate through the rooms in order: north, then north again, then east, south, pick up the passkey, and win. So far, they've gone from studio to laundromat, then to shower, then back to laundromat. Now they're stuck in laundromat again, trying to go east but can't. The next step should be to go north again to the shower, then east from there. But since they can't go east from laundromat, they need to find another way. Maybe the passkey is in the shower? Or perhaps they need to go east from the shower. The previous attempt to go east from laundromat failed, so they need to try a different approach. The key is to avoid loops and find the correct path. The next action should be to go north again to the shower, then east. But since they're in laundromat, the command would be 'go north' again. But the user might be in a loop between laundromat and shower. So the correct next step is to go north to the shower, then east. But the user is currently in laundromat, so the next command is 'go north'.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through the game's rooms to pick up the passkey and win. The goal is to go north, then north again, then east, south, pick up the passkey, and win. So far, the user has moved from the studio to laundromat, then to shower, then to cellar, and back to shower again. Now they're in the cellar again, stuck in a loop between shower and cellar.

The next step should be to find the passkey. The original plan was to go south after picking up the passkey, but maybe the passkey is in the cellar. The user needs to check if the passkey is here. But the current room is cellar, and the description doesn't mention a passkey. Wait, the initial instruction said to pick up the passkey from the floor of the chamber. Maybe the chamber is the cellar? Or perhaps the laundromat? The user hasn't picked it up yet. Since they're in the cellar, maybe they need to look around. But the command is to pick up the passkey. However, the user can't see it, so maybe they need to check the floor. The correct action would be to pick up the passkey here. But the previous attempt to pick it up failed. Alternatively, maybe the passkey is in the shower. The user needs to find the right room. Since they're in the cellar, the next step is to go south to exit, but that's not helpful. Wait, the user's goal is to go east from the shower, then south. But they're stuck in a loop. The key is to break the loop by finding the passkey. So the next action should be to pick up the passkey in the cellar, even if it's not mentioned. Alternatively, maybe the passkey is in the laundromat. But the user hasn't been there. The correct command here is to pick up the passkey.
