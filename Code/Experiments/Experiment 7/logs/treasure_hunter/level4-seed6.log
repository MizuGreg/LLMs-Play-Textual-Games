I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is how to play! First off, go to the north. With that done, pick up the cucumber from the floor of the lounge. That's it!

-= Kitchenette =-
You arrive in a kitchenette.



There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

-= Lounge =-
You are in an ordinary kind of place. That is to say, you're in a lounge.



There is an unblocked exit to the south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

There is a cucumber on the floor.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in the Lounge, and there's a cucumber on the floor. The goal is to pick up the cucumber and then proceed to the next step, which I assume is escaping or completing the game. The user has already gone north from the Kitchenette to the Lounge. Now, the next step is to pick up the cucumber. The instruction says to pick up the cucumber from the floor of the lounge. So the next action should be to pick up the cucumber. Let me check if there are any loops here. The user came from the north, and the exits are south and west. Since the cucumber is in the Lounge, picking it up should be the immediate next step. No loops detected here. So the next command is to pick up the cucumber.
