Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First off, venture south. After that, try to go west. That done, lift the gummy bear from the floor of the chamber. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Study =-
Well I'll be, you are in a place we're calling a study. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a display.

There is an unguarded exit to the north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through a text-based game. The initial instruction was to venture south, then west, pick up the gummy bear, and win. But the user got an error saying "venture south" isn't a recognized verb.

First, I need to figure out the correct commands. In text adventures, common verbs are north, south, east, west, go, move, etc. "Venture" might not be a valid command here. The user probably meant "go south" or "move south".

Looking at the environment description, the study has exits to north, south, and west. The user was told to first go south, then west. So the next step after south would be west. But the user tried "venture south" which failed. So the correct command should be "go south" or "move south".

The user's past action was "venture south", which didn't work. The next step is to go west. But since the user is in the study, after going south, they might be in a different room. Wait, the initial description says the study has an exit to the south. So after going south, they might be in another room. Then from there, go west. But the user might have gotten stuck in a loop.

Alternatively, maybe the correct sequence is: go south, then west, then pick up the gummy bear. But the user's first attempt was "venture south", which is invalid. So the next action should be "go south" instead.

So the correct next command is "go south".

-= Cookhouse =-
Guess what, you are in the place we're calling the cookhouse.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in a text-based game. The goal is to venture south, then west, pick up the gummy bear, and win. 

First, the initial step was "venture south," which the system didn't recognize. The user then tried "go south," which worked. Now, they're in the Cookhouse. The current description mentions exits to the south, east, north, and west. The user needs to follow the original plan: after going south, go west, then pick up the gummy bear.

But in the current room (Cookhouse), the user has to find the correct path. The previous action was going south, which led here. The next step according to the original plan was to go west. However, the system's response here says "You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked." 

So, the user is told that west is unblocked. Therefore, the next step should be to go west. But the user might have already tried that. Wait, the user's previous action was "go south," leading to Cookhouse. Now, the next step is to go west as per the original plan. The system's message here confirms that west is unblocked. So the correct next action is "go west." But the user might have already done that, but the game hasn't progressed yet. So the next command should be "go west."

-= Chamber =-
You've entered a chamber.

You make out a locker!

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

There is a gummy bear on the floor.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in a text-based game. The goal is to venture south, then west, pick up the gummy bear, and win. So far, they've moved from the Study to the Cookhouse and then to the Chamber. In the Chamber, there's a gummy bear on the floor.

The current step is to pick up the gummy bear. The user's previous actions were going south, then west, which led them to the Chamber. Now, they need to interact with the gummy bear. The command should be to pick it up. But in the game's context, the correct verb might be "take" or "lift". The user previously tried "lift the gummy bear", but maybe the game expects a different phrasing. However, the user's last action was moving west, and now they're in the Chamber. The next logical step is to pick up the gummy bear. So the correct command here is "take gummy bear" or "lift gummy bear". Since the game's feedback said "lift the gummy bear from the floor", maybe the exact command is "lift gummy bear". But the user might need to use the correct syntax. Let me check the previous messages. The user was told to "lift the gummy bear from the floor of the chamber. And once you've done that, you win!" So the correct action is to lift it. But in the game's context, maybe the command is simply "take gummy bear" or "lift gummy bear". Since the user is in the Chamber, and the gummy bear is on the floor, the next step is to pick it up. So the answer should be "lift gummy bear".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in a text-based game. The goal is to venture south, then west, lift the gummy bear, and win. So far, they've gone south to the cookhouse, then west to the chamber where the gummy bear is.

The last action was "lift gummy bear," but the game didn't recognize it. So, I need to figure out the correct verb. Maybe "pick up" is the right term instead of "lift." Let me check the previous steps again. The user was told to "lift the gummy bear from the floor of the chamber." But the game might be expecting a different command. 

In text adventures, common verbs for picking up items are "take" or "get." So perhaps "take gummy bear" or "get gummy bear" would work. But the user tried "lift," which wasn't recognized. So the next step is to use a synonym. The correct action here is likely "take" or "get." Let me confirm the game's expected commands. Since the user is in the chamber with the gummy bear on the floor, the correct command should be "take gummy bear" or "get gummy bear." 

So the next action should be "take gummy bear" to pick it up. That should complete the objective and win the game.
