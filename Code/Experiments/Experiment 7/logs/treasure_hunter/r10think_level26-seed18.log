You are now playing a exciting round of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to make an effort to go to the east. Following that, ensure that the oak door is open. After you have opened the oak door, attempt to travel north. And then, make an effort to take a trip west. And then, retrieve the fresh laundry scented key from the floor of the shower. After that, look and see that the fresh laundry scented door is unlocked with the fresh laundry scented key. Then, ensure that the fresh laundry scented door within the shower is open. After that, make an attempt to move north. Then, try to go to the east. With that done, ensure that the portal inside the studio is open. After that, travel north. Then, lift the latchkey from the floor of the cubicle. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to follow a series of steps in the TextWorld game. Let me recap the objectives step by step.

First, they need to go east from the cookhouse. Then open the oak door in the closet, go north to the studio, go west to the shower, take the fresh laundry key, unlock the fresh laundry door, open it, go north again, then east, open the portal in the studio, go north, and finally lift the latchkey from the cubicle.

Looking at the current state: The user is in the Shower. They've already taken the fresh laundry key. The next step according to the original plan was to check if the fresh laundry scented door is unlocked. But the user has to ensure that door is unlocked with the key they just picked up. So the next action should be to use the key on the door.

Wait, the previous action was taking the key. Now, the door is closed. So the next step is to unlock it. The command would be to "unlock fresh laundry scented door" or "use fresh laundry scented key on fresh laundry scented door". But in the game's context, maybe the correct command is "unlock door" or "open door" after using the key. However, the user has to make sure the door is unlocked. Since the key is in hand, the next logical step is to unlock the door. But the game might require using the key on the door. Let me check the previous steps. The user took the key, so now they need to use it on the door. The door is closed, so the action would be to unlock it. But the game might have specific commands. The user is in the shower, with the key. The door is closed. So the next action is to unlock the door. The correct command would be "unlock fresh laundry scented door". But maybe the game expects "open" or "use key on door". However, the user has to follow the exact commands the game accepts. Since the key is in hand, the next step is to unlock the door. So the next action is to unlock the door.

There is an open fresh laundry scented door leading south. There is an open gateway leading east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

There is a closed portal leading north. There is an open gateway leading west.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Cubicle and needs to lift the latchkey from the floor. The goal is to follow the steps outlined in the initial task. Let me recap the steps to ensure I don't miss anything.

First, the original plan was: go east from cookhouse, open oak door in closet, go north to studio, go west to shower, take the key, unlock the door, open it, go north again, then east, open the portal in the studio, go north, and finally lift the latchkey from the cubicle.

Looking at the current state: The user is in the Cubicle, which is part of the path. The next step according to the plan is to lift the latchkey. But the user has to make sure they pick it up. The previous action was going north to the Cubicle, and now they need to take the latchkey. The command should be "take latchkey" or "lift latchkey". However, the game might require using the correct verb. Since the user is in the Cubicle and the latchkey is on the floor, the next action is to pick it up. The correct command here is "take latchkey" or "lift latchkey". But the user has to check if "lift" is the right verb. In some games, "take" is used for picking up items. However, the user previously used "take" for the key in the shower. Let me check the previous interactions. The user took the fresh laundry key with "take fresh laundry scented key". So maybe "take" is the correct verb here. But the user is now in the Cubicle, and the latchkey is on the floor. So the next action should be "take latchkey" or "lift latchkey". The game might accept either, but since the user has already used "take" before, maybe that's the right approach. However, the user's last action was "go north" to the Cubicle, and now they need to pick up the latchkey. The correct command is "take latchkey".
