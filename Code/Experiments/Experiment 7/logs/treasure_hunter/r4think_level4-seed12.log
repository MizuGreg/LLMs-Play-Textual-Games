Welcome to TextWorld! Here is how to play! First of all, you could, like, venture south. Okay, and then, recover the bug from the floor of the closet. Alright, thanks!

-= Vault =-
You find yourself in a vault. A normal one.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the south. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

-= Closet =-
You've entered a closet. Let's see what's in here.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a durian and a bug on the floor.

That's not a verb I recognise.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Closet scene. The goal is to recover the bug from the floor of the closet. The user tried "recover the bug from the floor of the closet." but the system said that's not a verb.

So first, I need to figure out the correct action. The game might expect a verb like "take" or "pick up" instead of "recover." Since "recover" isn't recognized, maybe the correct command is "take the bug" or "pick up the bug."

Looking back at the previous steps: the user went south into the closet, then tried to recover the bug. The system didn't accept that. So the next step is to use a different verb. The correct action here is likely "take the bug" or "pick up the bug." Since the user is in the closet, and the bug is on the floor, the right command would be "take the bug" or "pick up the bug."

The user needs to use the correct verb. Since "recover" isn't working, the alternative is to use "take" or "pick up." The correct command here is probably "take the bug."
</think>take the bug
