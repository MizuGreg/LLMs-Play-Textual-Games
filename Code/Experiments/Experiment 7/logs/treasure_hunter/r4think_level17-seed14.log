I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. Your first objective is to attempt to take a trip north. Then, open the portal within the laundromat. Having opened the portal, make an effort to venture north. Then, make an effort to move west. After that, travel north. After that, travel east. With that over with, retrieve the butterfly from the box within the workshop. That's it!

-= Canteen =-
Well, here we are in a canteen.

You can see a chest. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You can make out a case.

There is an open gate leading north. There is an open hatch leading west.

-= Laundromat =-
You've entered a laundromat.

You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a rack. The rack is typical. But the thing is empty.

There is a closed portal leading north. There is an open gate leading south.

-= Cellar =-
You are in a cellar. A normal one.



There is an open portal leading south. There is an open passageway leading west.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to navigate through different areas, open portals, and retrieve the butterfly from the workshop. So far, they've started by going north from the canteen, opened the portal in the laundromat, and then went north again into the cellar. Now, they're in the cellar, which is step 4.

The next steps according to the original task are to move west, then north again, then east. After that, go to the workshop and get the butterfly. But in the current location (cellar), there's an open passageway west and a portal south. The user needs to move west first. But the previous action was going north, so maybe moving west is the next logical step. However, the user might be stuck in a loop if they keep going back and forth. But since the cellar has a west passage, moving west should be the next step. Then from there, maybe they can go north again, then east, and finally reach the workshop. So the next action should be west.
</think>go west

-= Office =-
You find yourself in an usual kind of place. That is to say, you're in an office.

You can see a desk. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

There is an open passageway leading east. There is an open gateway leading north.



>                                                                                                                                -= Office =-0/5

-= Chamber =-
You find yourself in a chamber. An ordinary one.



There is an open gateway leading south. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked.



>                                                                                                                                -= Chamber =-0/6

Okay, let's see. The user's goal is to navigate through the areas, open portals, and get the butterfly. So far, they've gone from canteen to laundromat, opened the portal, went to cellar, then to office, and now to chamber. The next step according to the original plan was to move east after going north. But in the chamber, there's an exit to the east and a gateway south. The user needs to go east next. Wait, the previous action was going north into the chamber. The next step should be east as per the plan. But maybe they need to check if moving east is the right move. Since the chamber has an exit east, that's the next step. So the next action is go east.

-= Workshop =-
You've just shown up in a workshop.

You can see a box. The box contains a butterfly. You make out a locker. You can see a portmanteau.

You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.



>                                                                                                                                -= Workshop =-0/7
