Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, you could, like, make an effort to move south. Then, ensure that the hatch within the cellar is open. After you have opened the hatch, head south. And then, open the portal. And then, attempt to head south. Then, move west. With that accomplished, make an effort to go to the north. Following that, go west. Then, pick up the peanut from the floor of the studio. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Pantry =-
You've entered a pantry. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

An open chest is close by. The chest is empty, what a horrible day! Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. But the thing is empty. Look over there! a shelf. The shelf is normal. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

There is an open gate leading south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Guess what, you are in the place we're calling the cubicle. You begin looking for stuff.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break down the user's problem. They need to navigate through different rooms in a text-based game, following specific steps to reach the final goal of picking up the peanut in the studio and winning.

First, I'll recap the game's objective: Move south, open the cellar hatch, go south again, open the portal, move south, west, north, west, then pick up the peanut in the studio. The user has already done most of these steps up to the cubicle. Now, they're in the cubicle, which has a safe and a locker, but the peanut isn't here. The next step according to the instructions is to go west from the cubicle. But the user is already in the cubicle, so maybe they need to check the west exit. However, the user's last action was "go west" from the kitchenette to the cubicle. Now, in the cubicle, the west exit is unguarded. So the next step would be to go west from the cubicle. But the user might be stuck in a loop if they keep moving between rooms without finding the peanut. The peanut is in the studio, so they need to find a way to get there. The previous steps led them to the cubicle, so maybe they need to check the north or east exits from the cubicle. But the goal is to go west from the cubicle. Wait, the user's next step after the cubicle is to go west again. But the cubicle's west exit leads back to the kitchenette. Maybe the user is looping between the kitchenette and cubicle. To break the loop, they need to find a different path. Alternatively, maybe the peanut is in the studio, which is accessible via the portal. Wait, the user has already opened the portal in the basement and went south to the kitchenette. Then went west to the cubicle. Now, from the cubicle, the next step is to go west again, but that's the same as before. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go north from the cubicle to the kitchenette again, then find another way. But the user's goal is to go west from the cubicle. Wait, the original instructions said after going west from the kitchenette to the cubicle, then go north, then west again. So from the cubicle, go north to the kitchenette, then west again. But the user is in the cubicle now. So the next step is to go north from the cubicle. But the user's last action was going west to the cubicle. So the next step should be to go north from the cubicle. But the user might be stuck in a loop between cubicle and kitchenette. Therefore, the correct next action is to go north from the cubicle to the kitchenette, then west again. But the user is in the cubicle, so the next command should be "go north" to exit the cubicle and proceed to the kitchenette again. Then, from the kitchenette, go west again. But the user's goal is to go west from the cubicle. Wait, the original steps after the cubicle are: go north, then west. So from the cubicle, go north to the kitchenette, then west to the studio. But the user is in the cubicle, so the next step is to go north. Therefore, the correct command is "go north".
