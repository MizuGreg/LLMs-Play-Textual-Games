Welcome to TextWorld! Here is how to play! First, it would be good if you could go south. Following that, travel east. With that done, attempt to go to the east. And then, pick-up the shoe from the floor of the attic. Got that? Good!

-= Office =-
You are in an office. A standard kind of place. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."



There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

-= Study =-
Well, here we are in a study.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Cubicle =-
You are in a cubicle. An ordinary one. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

There is a latchkey and a shoe on the floor.
