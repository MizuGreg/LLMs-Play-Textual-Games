Welcome to another exciting episode of TextWorld! First thing I need you to do is to try to move south. With that over with, try to go west. And then, make an effort to go south. Once you do that, try to go to the west. Then, make an effort to go to the south. With that over with, make an effort to travel west. And then, take a trip south. Following that, attempt to take a trip east. After that, attempt to go east. Once you get through with that, attempt to go to the north. And then, pick-up the passkey from the floor of the spare room. Got that? Good!

-= Shower =-
You find yourself in a shower. An ordinary one.

You make out a locked safe close by. You make out a rack. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open passageway leading south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms to find a passkey. The initial instructions mention moving south, west, south again, west, south, east, east again, north, and then picking up the passkey from the spare room.

First, the current location is the Sauna. The user has already moved south from the Shower, which is the first step. Now, in the Sauna, the options are north and west. The next steps according to the initial plan were to go west, then south, west, south, east, east, north, and then collect the passkey.

But the user is in the Sauna. The previous action was "go south" from the Shower. Now, in the Sauna, the next step according to the plan is to go west. However, the user might be stuck in a loop if they keep moving between rooms without progress. The goal is to reach the spare room and pick up the passkey. So, the next action should be to go west from the Sauna. But if that leads back to a previous room, maybe they need to find another way. However, the user's next step should be to follow the initial plan: go west from Sauna, then south, etc. But the user needs to check if moving west is the correct next step. Since the Sauna has a west portal, going west is the next action. The user needs to proceed step by step as instructed.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a laundromat now. The previous steps were moving south from the shower, then west to the sauna, then west again to the laundromat. The goal is to pick up the passkey from the spare room.

Wait, the user's instructions said to move south, west, south, west, south, east, north, and then get the passkey. But so far, they've gone south (shower to sauna), then west (sauna to laundromat). Now, the next step according to the initial plan was to go south again from the laundromat. But the laundromat has an open portal east and a gate south. So maybe the next step is to go south from here. But the user might be looping if they keep going back. However, the passkey is in the spare room, which might be north or east? Wait, the initial plan was to go north after east. Hmm.

Wait, the user's previous actions were: go south (shower to sauna), then west (sauna to laundromat). Now, in the laundromat, the next step according to the initial instructions was to go south again. But the laundromat's south gate leads to where? Maybe the next room. But the user needs to reach the spare room. Maybe the passkey is in a room that requires moving east first. The initial plan said after going south multiple times, then east, then north. So perhaps from the laundromat, go east first, then south, then north to get the passkey. But the user's last action was west, so maybe they need to go south from laundromat. But the user might be getting stuck in a loop. However, the instructions say to not repeat actions if it's not progressing. So the next step should be to go south from laundromat. But the user's previous steps were moving west and south. Let me check the environment again.

In the laundromat, the user can go east or south. The initial plan was to go south, west, south, west, south, east, north. So after laundromat, the next step is south. But maybe that's part of the loop. However, the passkey is in the spare room, which might be accessible via north after east. So perhaps the correct path is from laundromat, go east, then south, then north to get the key. But the user's previous steps were west, so maybe they need to go south now. But the user's last action was west, so the next step is south. The answer should be "go south".

You arrive in a bar. A standard one.

You can make out a recliner. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.

There is an open gate leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in TextWorld. The goal is to pick up the passkey from the spare room. Let me recap the steps taken so far.

Starting in the shower, they went south to the sauna. Then west to the laundromat, then south to the bar. Now in the bar, the directions are north, east, south, west. The user needs to find the spare room where the passkey is. 

Looking at the previous moves: shower → sauna → laundromat → bar. The next step would be to check the other directions. The bar has an exit to the west, which was mentioned as unblocked. Maybe going west from the bar would lead to another area. But the user has to avoid loops. Since they've been moving south and west, maybe trying east or north could be new. But the user's initial instructions were to go south, west, south, west, south, east, north, then pick up the passkey. 

Wait, the user's initial plan was to move south, west, south, west, south, east, north. But in the current position (bar), the next step might be to go east or west. The user has to follow the sequence but avoid loops. Since they're in the bar, going west might lead back to the laundromat or another area. Alternatively, going east could be a new direction. The passkey is in the spare room, so maybe after moving through various rooms, they need to find the correct path. 

The user's last action was going south to the bar. Now, the next step should be to go west, as per the initial plan. But if that leads to a loop, they need to try a different direction. However, the bar's west exit is unblocked, so going west from the bar would be the next step. But the user has to check if that's part of the sequence. Alternatively, maybe the correct path requires moving east from the bar. But according to the initial instructions, after the bar, the next step was to go north. Wait, the initial plan was: after the bar, go north. But the user is in the bar now. So the next action should be to go north. But the bar has a north gate. So the next command is go north.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms to pick up a passkey from the spare room. The previous actions have been moving south, west, south, north, which brought them back to the laundromat. So, they're in a loop between the laundromat and the bar.

The goal is to reach the spare room, pick up the passkey, and presumably escape or complete the game. The user's past actions have been moving between rooms, but they're stuck in a loop. The next step should be to break the loop by trying a different direction. Since the laundromat has an open portal east and a gate south, but going south leads back to the bar, which then leads back to the laundromat, maybe trying east from the laundromat is the way to go. But the user just tried going north from the bar, which led back to the laundromat. So, the next action should be to go east from the laundromat to avoid the loop. However, the user's last action was going north, which brought them back. So, the next step is to go east to proceed further.

Okay, let's try to figure out what's going on here. The user is in a text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and eventually pick up a passkey from the spare room. The previous actions have been moving around between the shower, sauna, laundromat, and bar. The current location is the sauna, and the user has been moving back and forth between the sauna and laundromat.

The goal is to reach the spare room, pick up the passkey, and presumably escape or complete the game. The user's past actions include moving south, west, east, north, and back again, which suggests they might be in a loop. The challenge is to break that loop and find a new path.

Looking at the current room (sauna), there's a passageway north and a portal west. The laundromat has an east and south exit. The user needs to find a way to get to the spare room without repeating the same movements. Since the previous steps have led back to the sauna and laundromat, maybe the next step is to try a different direction. However, the sauna's west portal might lead to a new area. Alternatively, the laundromat's east portal could be a way forward. But the user has already tried moving east from the laundromat, which brought them back to the sauna. 

Wait, the user's last action was "go east" from the laundromat, which took them back to the sauna. Now, in the sauna, the options are north and west. If moving north leads back to the laundromat, then maybe west is the way to go. But the user needs to avoid loops. If moving west from the sauna leads to a new area, that might be the key. Alternatively, maybe the spare room is accessible through a different path that hasn't been explored yet. 

The user needs to check if there's a way to get to the spare room without looping. Since the passkey is in the spare room, the path to it must be unexplored. The previous movements have been between sauna, laundromat, bar, and back. Maybe the next step is to go west from the sauna, which might lead to a new room that's part of the path to the spare room. Alternatively, moving north from the sauna might lead to the laundromat again, which is already been visited. So, the best next step is to go west from the sauna to explore a new area that hasn't been checked yet.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms to pick up a passkey from the spare room. The goal is to follow a specific path: move south, west, south, west, south, east, east, north, and then get the passkey.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Laundromat again, which they've been in before. The previous steps involved moving between rooms like the Shower, Sauna, Laundromat, Bar, and back to Laundromat. The user has been moving west and east, but it seems like they're stuck in a loop between the Laundromat and Sauna.

The challenge here is to break the loop. The user has been going back and forth between these two rooms. The next step should be to find a different direction or action that leads them towards the spare room where the passkey is. Since the Laundromat has an open portal east and a gate south, maybe moving east again could lead to a new area. But the user has already tried that. Alternatively, maybe they need to check if there's another way to get to the spare room without looping.

Wait, the initial instructions mentioned going through specific directions: south, west, south, west, south, east, east, north. After moving north from the Bar, they went back to the Laundromat. Now, they need to continue following the path. The next step after moving north from the Bar would be to go east again, but that's where they are now. Maybe they need to go south from the Laundromat to reach the next room. But the user has already done that before. 

Alternatively, maybe the passkey is in the spare room, which is part of the path. The user needs to reach the spare room by following the directions. Since they're in the Laundromat again, perhaps the next step is to go south again to exit to the next room. But the user has to make sure they're not looping. The key is to continue moving in the specified directions without getting stuck. The next action should be to go south from the Laundromat to proceed further.

Okay, let's try to figure out what's going on here. The user is in a text-based game where they have to navigate through different rooms and eventually pick up a passkey from the spare room. The goal is to reach the spare room and get the passkey.

Looking at the history of movements: the user started by going south from the shower, then west to the sauna, then east to the laundromat, south again to the bar, north back to the laundromat, east to the sauna, west back to the laundromat, and then south to the bar again. It seems like they're moving between the laundromat, sauna, and bar repeatedly. That's a loop. The user needs to break this loop to progress further.

The next step should be to find a way out of the current room (the bar) without repeating the same actions. The bar has a north gate, east entrance, south exit, and west exit. Since the user has been going back and forth between these rooms, maybe they need to try a different direction. The previous action was going south to the bar, so maybe trying east or west from the bar could lead to a new path. But the user has already tried east and west in previous steps. Alternatively, maybe the passkey is in the bar, but the user hasn't checked there yet. However, the initial instruction mentioned picking up the passkey from the floor of the spare room, so the user needs to reach the spare room.

Wait, the user hasn't mentioned entering the spare room yet. The current location is the bar. The spare room might be accessible from another direction. Maybe the user needs to go west from the bar to exit, but that's where they came from. Alternatively, maybe the passkey is in the bar, but the user hasn't looked. However, the initial problem statement says to pick up the passkey from the floor of the spare room, so the user needs to get to the spare room.

But the user is stuck in a loop between laundromat, sauna, and bar. To break the loop, they need to find a new path. The next action should be to go east from the bar, but that's where they came from. Wait, the bar has an east entranceway unblocked. Maybe going east from the bar would lead to a new area. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go north from the bar to the laundromat again, but that's already been done. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west from the bar to exit, but that's the same as before.

Wait, the user's previous action was going south to the bar. Now, in the bar, the options are north, east, south, west. The user needs to avoid the loop. Maybe the correct direction is east, but that's where they came from. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west from the bar to exit, but that's the same as before. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east from the bar to a new room that hasn't been explored yet. The initial instructions mentioned going east after some steps, but perhaps that's the way to go. The user's next action should be to go east from the bar, even though they've been there before, but maybe that's the key to breaking the loop and moving towards the spare room.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a cubicle, and the goal is to pick up the passkey from the spare room. The previous steps have been moving around different rooms like shower, sauna, laundromat, bar, and now cubicle. The user needs to find the passkey.

Looking at the current room, the cubicle has exits to the south and west. The user has been moving back and forth between rooms, possibly looping. The previous actions were going south, west, east, north, etc., but maybe they're stuck in a cycle.

The goal was to get to the spare room and pick up the passkey. The spare room might be a specific location. Since the cubicle is mentioned as oddly familiar, maybe it's part of the path. But the user hasn't found the passkey yet.

The next step would be to check if the cubicle has any items. The description says there's a bookshelf but it's empty. So maybe the passkey is in another room. The exits are south and west. The user needs to go through those exits to reach the spare room. Since the user was previously in the bar and moved east to the cubicle, maybe the spare room is in the south or west direction from here.

But the user has to avoid loops. Since moving south or west might lead back to previous rooms, they need to check which direction leads to the spare room. The user should try moving south first, as that's the exit mentioned. If that leads to a room with the passkey, then pick it up. If not, maybe west. But the user needs to proceed step by step without repeating actions that don't help.

Look at you, bigshot, walking into a studio like it isn't some huge deal. Let's see what's in here.

You can see a desk. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hm. Oh well

You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a studio, and the goal is to pick up the passkey from the spare room. The previous steps have been moving around different rooms, but they haven't found the passkey yet.

Looking at the current room, the Studio, the description mentions a desk that's empty. The exits are north and west. The user needs to get to the spare room. The previous movements have been going back and forth between rooms, maybe getting stuck in a loop.

The user's past actions include moving south, west, north, east, etc., but they haven't found the passkey. The next step should be to check if the spare room is accessible from here. Since the Studio has an exit to the west, maybe that leads to the spare room. But the user needs to confirm.

Wait, the initial instruction was to move south, then west, then south again, and so on. But the user might be looping between rooms without progress. The key is to find the spare room and pick up the passkey. So, from the Studio, going west might lead to the spare room. Let me check the previous steps again.

In the Studio, the exit to the west is mentioned. So the next action should be to go west. That's the logical step to proceed towards the spare room. The user needs to avoid looping by making sure they're moving towards the target room. So the next command is go west.

-= Spare Room =-
I never took you for the sort of person who would show up in a spare room, but I guess I was wrong.



There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

There is a passkey on the floor.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Spare Room and there's a passkey on the floor. The goal was to pick up the passkey from the floor of the spare room. So the first step is to confirm the goal: collect the passkey.

Looking at the past actions, the user has been moving through various rooms, going south, west, east, north, etc., which aligns with the initial instructions. The last action was going west, which led them to the Spare Room. Now, in the Spare Room, the passkey is on the floor, so the next step is to pick it up.

Check if there's a loop. The user has already visited the Spare Room and found the passkey. The previous actions didn't involve repeating without progress. So no loop here. The next action should be to pick up the passkey. The command would be "take passkey" or "get passkey". But the system might expect "take" as the verb. So the correct command is "take passkey".
</think>take passkey
