Welcome to TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, take a trip west. After that, travel south. With that over with, make an effort to venture west. And then, move south. Then, move south. With that done, go east. Once you manage that, make an attempt to go north. That done, venture east. And then, recover the passkey from the floor of the bar. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

Welcome to the kitchen.

You make out a board. The board is usual. But there isn't a thing on it. You move on, clearly angry about your TextWorld experience.

You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a TextWorld game and needs to follow specific movement steps to recover the passkey from the bar's floor. The goal is to navigate through various rooms in a certain order: west, south, west, south, east, north, east, then get the passkey.

Looking at the current location, the user is in the Laundromat. The previous steps have been: Kitchen > Cookhouse > Studio > Scullery > Chamber > Laundromat. The next step according to the initial instructions was to go east from the Chamber, which led to the Laundromat. Now, in the Laundromat, the next step in the original plan was to go north, but the user might be stuck in a loop here.

The user's current position is the Laundromat. The available exits are east, north, south, west. The original plan after the Laundromat was to go north, but if that's not working, maybe trying a different direction. The passkey is in the bar's floor, which might be in a different area. But the user needs to follow the steps: after the Laundromat, the next step was to go north, then east, then get the passkey. However, if going north from Laundromat isn't possible or leads back, maybe trying south or west instead. But the user needs to avoid loops. Since the previous actions didn't progress, changing the direction slightly, like going south instead of north, might help escape the loop. So the next action should be 'go south' from the Laundromat.

Looking at the current position, the user is in the Scullery (0/12). Previous steps have them moving back and forth between Laundromat, Chamber, Studio, Scullery, which suggests they might be in a loop. The original plan was to go west from the Studio to Scullery, then north from Scullery. But they've ended up looping between these areas.

The next step in the original plan after Scullery was to go north, but that leads back to the Laundromat. Since the user is stuck in a loop, they need to try a different direction. Instead of north, maybe go east from Scullery, which was mentioned as an unguarded exit. That might take them to a new area where the passkey is located. So the next action should be 'go east' to break the loop and progress towards the passkey.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a loop between the Studio and Scullery, moving back and forth. The goal is to recover the passkey from the bar's floor after following specific movement steps.

First, the goal steps are: west, south, west, south, east, north, east, then get the passkey. So far, the user has done west (Kitchen -> Cookhouse), south (Cookhouse -> Studio), west (Studio -> Scullery), south (Scullery -> Chamber), east (Chamber -> Laundromat), north (Laundromat -> Studio), west (Studio -> Scullery). They're stuck here again.

The loop is between Studio and Scullery. The next step should be to go north from Scullery, but that leads back to the Laundromat. Wait, the user needs to get to the bar's floor. Maybe the passkey is in the Studio's locked toolbox or the closed bureau. But the user hasn't checked those yet. However, the original plan was to move east from the Chamber, then north, then east. Maybe the passkey is in the bar, which is in the Laundromat or another area. But the user is stuck in a loop, so they need to find a different path. Perhaps trying south from Scullery to get to the Chamber again, then east to Laundromat, then north to Studio, then east to get the passkey. But the user needs to avoid repeating the same steps. Since going west and east is causing the loop, maybe trying a different direction like north from Scullery, even if it's been done before, to see if there's a new path. Alternatively, check the objects in the Studio, like the locked toolbox, to see if they can open it. But the user's next move should be to go north from Scullery to break the loop and proceed further.

Look over there! a case. You look around you, at all the containers and supporters, doors and objects, and you think to yourself. Why? Why Textworld? You can see a fridge. The fridge is empty! What a waste of a day!

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Cookhouse and Kitchen, repeatedly going east and west. The goal is to recover the passkey from the bar's floor after following specific movement steps. The user has been moving back and forth without progress.

First, the goal steps are: west, south, west, south, east, north, east, then get the passkey. So far, the user has done west (Kitchen), south (Cookhouse), west (Studio), south (Scullery), east (Chamber), north (Laundromat), west (Studio), south (Laundromat), north (Studio), east (Cookhouse), west (Kitchen), east (Cookhouse), west (Kitchen), etc. They're stuck in a loop between Cookhouse and Kitchen.

The loop is between Cookhouse and Kitchen. The next step should be to check the closed chest in the Cookhouse corner, as that's the only object mentioned there. The user hasn't interacted with it yet. So instead of repeating west and east, they should try opening the chest to find the passkey. That would break the loop and achieve the goal.

Welcome to the kitchen.

You make out a board. The board is usual. But there isn't a thing on it. You move on, clearly angry about your TextWorld experience.

You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.
