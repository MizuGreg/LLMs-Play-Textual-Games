Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an fast paced round of TextWorld? You do! Your first objective is to insert the type H latchkey into the type H gateway in the studio's lock to unlock it. And then, open the type H gateway inside the studio. After that, try to head west. Following that, venture west. After that, venture north. And then, make an effort to venture west. With that over with, head south. With that done, travel west. Then, move north. Then, make an effort to go north. Then, attempt to take a trip north. Okay, and then, try to go to the east. With that accomplished, take a trip north. With that done, pick-up the durian from the floor of the dish-pit. And once you've done that, you win!

Ah, the studio. This is some kind of studio, really great ordinary vibes in this place, a wonderful ordinary atmosphere. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

You can see a mantle. The mantle is normal. However, the mantle, like an empty mantle, has nothing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is a closed type H gateway leading west. There is an open door leading north.

THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through a text adventure game. The main goal is to insert the type H latchkey into the type H gateway, open it, then follow a series of directions to reach the durian and win.

First, I need to make sure I understand the current state. The user has already tried inserting the latchkey and opening the gateway, but the system hasn't recognized those actions. The next step is to check if the actions are being processed correctly. 

Looking at the previous responses, the user might be stuck because the game isn't acknowledging the correct steps. The next action should be to use a synonym or alternative phrasing for the commands. For example, instead of "insert," maybe "use" or "place." Also, the user needs to proceed through the directions: west, west, north, west, south, west, north, north, east, north, pick up the durian.

Wait, the user's last action was "open the type H gateway inside the studio." But the system didn't recognize it. So maybe the correct action is to "use the type H latchkey on the type H gateway" instead of inserting. Or perhaps "activate the gateway." Also, after opening the gateway, the next steps involve moving directions. But the user might be in a loop if they're not progressing. So the next step should be to move west after opening the gateway. But the user needs to make sure each action is correctly phrased. The key is to avoid repeating the same action and use different commands if needed. The final step is to pick up the durian, so after all the movements, that's the goal.

The current location is a study with a gate north and a door south. The user can't go west, so they need to find another way.

The key steps are: insert the latchkey, open the gateway, move through the specified directions. But since the user is in the study now, maybe they need to go south first. The previous actions led to a loop, so changing the direction might help. Instead of continuing west, going south could lead them back to the studio. Then, after opening the gateway, proceed with the movements. The next step is to go south from the study, then check the directions again. Finally, pick up the durian once all movements are done.

Okay, let's try to figure out what's going on here. The user is trying to complete a text adventure game where they need to insert a latchkey into a gateway, open it, and then navigate through various rooms to pick up a durian. The current problem is that the user is stuck in the Laundromat, unable to go west or south.

First, the goal steps are clear: insert the type H latchkey into the type H gateway, open it, then follow the movement directions to reach the durian. But the user has been trying to move west and south, which are not allowed in the Laundromat. The previous attempts to open the gateway didn't work, so maybe the correct action is to use the latchkey on the gateway first.

The user is in the Laundromat, which has an open gate south and a hatch west. Since they can't go west, maybe they need to go south first. But the previous commands tried going west again, which is blocked. The key is to find another way to proceed. Perhaps the correct sequence is to go south from the Laundromat, then find the studio again, open the gateway, and proceed with the movements. The next step should be to go south, then check the studio's gateway again.

First, the goal steps are: insert latchkey into gateway, open it, move through specific directions. But the user is in the Laundromat, which doesn't have the durian. Maybe the durian is in the studio or study. The user needs to go back to the studio, open the gateway, then proceed to the dish-pit where the durian is. The problem is that the user can't see the durian here, so they need to navigate back to the correct location. The next step is to go south from the Laundromat to the studio, then open the gateway and proceed to the dish-pit.

FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in the Study, trying to navigate but can't go west. The goal is to insert the latchkey, open the gateway, then move through specific directions to get the durian. The previous attempts to move west didn't work, so maybe the correct action is to go south first from the Study to return to the Studio. Then open the gateway again and proceed with the movements. The next step should be to go south, then check the Studio's gateway again.

-= Laundromat =-
You've just shown up in a laundromat. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a cabinet. You shudder, but continue examining the room. The cabinet is empty! What a waste of a day! You can make out a chipped shelf. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open gate leading south. There is an open hatch leading west.

Okay, let's try to figure out what's going on here. The user is stuck in a loop between different rooms in TextWorld, trying to navigate through the game to pick up the durian. The main goal is to insert the type H latchkey into the type H gateway, open it, and then follow a series of movements to reach the dish-pit where the durian is.

First, the goal steps are clear: insert the latchkey, open the gateway, then move through specific directions. But the user is getting stuck in the Closet, which has an exit to the east. The previous attempts to move west or south aren't working, so maybe the correct action is to go east from the Closet. Then, after exiting, they need to find the studio again, open the gateway, and proceed with the movements. The next step should be to go east from the Closet to continue the journey.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop and can't find the durian. The goal is to insert the latchkey, open the gateway, and navigate to the dish-pit. The previous attempts to move west and east aren't working. The key is to find another way out. Maybe the correct action is to use the latchkey on the gateway again, then go east from the Closet. The next step should be to go east to escape the loop and continue the journey.

You've just shown up in a laundromat. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a cabinet. You shudder, but continue examining the room. The cabinet is empty! What a waste of a day! You can make out a chipped shelf. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open gate leading south. There is an open hatch leading west.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

-= Restroom =-
You find yourself in a restroom. A typical one. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

A locked box is in the room. You see a drawer. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a shiny shelf. The shelf appears to be empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is an open hatch leading east. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

-= Closet =-
You arrive in a closet. A standard kind of place. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

You see a workbench. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a workbench, go to TextWorld. The workbench is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an unblocked exit to the east.
