Welcome to another profound game of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First off, open the hatch. After that, make an attempt to move west. Next, ensure that the portal is open. And then, make an attempt to head north. And then, doublecheck that the door is ajar. And then, travel north. And then, pick-up the potato from the floor of the salon. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Kitchen =-
If you're wondering why everything seems so typical all of a sudden, it's because you've just shown up in the kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.



There is a closed hatch leading west. There is an open gateway leading east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user needs to follow a specific sequence of actions to win the game. The goal is to open the hatch, move west, open the portal, go north, check the door, go north again, and pick up the potato in the salon.

So far, the user has opened the hatch, gone west to the office, opened the portal, and gone north to the attic. Now, in the attic, they need to check if the door is open. The next step according to the instructions is to double-check the door is ajar. But the current description says the door is closed. Wait, the user has to make sure the door is open. Since the door is closed here, they need to open it. But the previous step was going north, which led them here. Wait, the original plan was after opening the portal and going north, then check the door, then go north again. But in the attic, there's a closed door leading north and an open portal south. So maybe the next step is to open the door leading north. But the user's next action should be to check the door's state. However, the user hasn't done that yet. The next step in the original plan was to double-check the door is ajar. But in the attic, the door is closed. So perhaps the user needs to open it. But the original instructions said after going north, check the door. So maybe the user is in the attic now, and the next step is to check the door. But the user hasn't done that yet. Wait, the user's previous action was going north to the attic. The next step in the original plan was to double-check the door is ajar. But in the attic, the door is closed. So the user needs to open it. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action should be to open the door. But the user might have missed that step. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check the door's state first. However, the user's next action should be to check if the door is open. But the current description says the door is closed. So the user needs to open it. Therefore, the next action is to open the door. But the user's previous steps were: open hatch, go west, open portal, go north. Now in the attic, the next step is to open the door leading north. But the original plan said after going north, check the door. But the door is closed here. So the user needs to open it. Therefore, the next action is to open the door. But the user might have to do that. However, the user's next action should be to check the door, but since it's closed, they need to open it. So the correct next action is to open the door. But the user might have to do that. So the answer is to open the door.

-= Salon =-
Guess what, you are in the place we're calling the salon.

You make out a bookshelf. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

There is an open door leading south. There is an open gate leading east.

There is a potato on the floor.

Okay, let's see. The user needs to pick up the potato in the salon to win. The goal steps are: open hatch, go west, open portal, go north, check door, go north again, pick up potato.

So far, they've opened the hatch, went west to the office, opened the portal, went north to the attic, opened the door, and now they're in the salon. The next step should be to pick up the potato. But the user hasn't done that yet. The current location is the salon, which has the potato on the floor. So the next action is to pick up the potato. The previous actions have all been followed, so the next step is to take the potato. The user is in the correct place now, so the command is "take potato" or "pick up potato". Since the game uses "pick-up", maybe "pick-up potato" is the exact command. But the user's previous action was "go north", and now they're in the salon. The potato is there, so the next step is to pick it up. No loops here, so the answer is to pick up the potato.
