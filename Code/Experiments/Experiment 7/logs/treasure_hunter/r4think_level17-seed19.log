I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First, it would be good if you could attempt to travel east. Then, make an attempt to head north. After that, open the portal. After that, attempt to move west. After that, try to venture north. Then, move west. And then, pick-up the latchkey from the floor of the kitchen. And once you've done that, you win!

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in TextWorld. The goal is to follow a series of steps: go east, then north, open the portal, move west, venture north again, move west, pick up the latchkey from the kitchen, and then win.

So far, the user has gone from the basement to the garage, then to the laundry place. Now, in the laundry place, there's a closed portal leading west. The hint says to try going east or south for an unblocked exit. The user needs to find a way to proceed.

The next step according to the initial plan was to open the portal, but the portal is closed. However, the user might need to find the right exit first. The current room is the laundry place. The available exits are north, east, south, and west (but the portal is closed west). The user needs to find an unblocked exit. The prompt suggests trying east or south.

Wait, the user's previous actions were: go east (from basement to garage), then go north (from garage to laundry). Now, in the laundry place, the exits are north, east, south, but the portal is closed west. The user needs to find an unblocked exit. The hint says to try east or south. Let's check the description again.

In the laundry place, the text says: "There is a closed portal leading west. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south." So the user needs to find an unblocked exit, either east or south. The user is in the laundry place now. So the next step should be to go east or south. But the user's next action in the previous step was to go north, which led to the laundry place. Now, the user needs to go east or south.

But the user's next action should be to go east first. Let's check the possible exits. The user is in the laundry place. The exits are north, east, south, and west (but west is a closed portal). So the user can try going east or south. The user's next step should be to go east. But the user's previous action was going north, so maybe the next step is to go east. However, the user's next action should be to go east or south. Let's check the game's current state.

The user is in the laundry place. The description says that there's a durian on the floor. So maybe the user needs to go east or south. The user's next action should be to go east. But the user's previous steps were: basement -> garage -> laundry. Now, in the laundry place, the user needs to go east or south. The user's next action is to go east. But the user's next step in the original plan was to open the portal, but the portal is closed. So maybe the user needs to find the right exit first. So the next step is to go east or south. The user should try going east first. Let's check the possible exits again.

-= Cookhouse =-
This cookhouse you have just entered is definitely normal.

As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a fridge. You see a chair! The chair is typical. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to follow a specific sequence of actions to win the game. The steps are: go east, then north, open the portal, move west, venture north again, move west, pick up the latchkey from the kitchen, and then win.

So far, the user has gone from the basement to the garage, then to the laundry place. In the laundry place, they tried going east and south but got stuck. Then they went west back to the laundry place. Now, they're back in the laundry place again, which suggests a loop.

The current room is the laundry place, and the portal is closed west. The hints say to try going east or south for an unblocked exit. The user tried going east and south but got stuck. Then they went west again, which brings them back to the same room. This loop means they need a different approach.

The next step should be to open the portal. But the portal is closed, so maybe they need a key or something. However, the user hasn't picked up any items yet. The durian is on the floor, but that's not helpful. The latchkey is in the kitchen, which they haven't reached yet.

Wait, the user's next action should be to open the portal. But the portal is closed. Maybe they need to find a way to open it. Alternatively, maybe they need to find the correct exit first. Since the portal is closed, perhaps they need to find another exit. The user is in the laundry place, and the exits are north, east, south, and west (portal). The user needs to find an unguarded exit. The hint says to try east or south. But when they tried east, they went to the cookhouse, then tried south but couldn't. Then they went west back to laundry.

So, maybe the correct next step is to try opening the portal. But how? The user might need a key. However, the user hasn't found any keys yet. The latchkey is in the kitchen. So maybe they need to proceed to the kitchen first.

Alternatively, maybe the user should try going north from the laundry place. The cookhouse is north, but the user was there before. Wait, in the cookhouse, there's an exit to the west, which is the laundry place. So maybe the user needs to go north again from the laundry place. But the user is stuck in the laundry place, so perhaps they need to find another way.

The user's next action should be to open the portal. But since it's closed, maybe they need to find a way to open it. However, the user hasn't picked up any items yet. The durian is on the floor, but that's not helpful. The user needs to find the latchkey first.

Wait, the original plan was to go east, north, open portal, west, north, west, pick up latchkey. So after opening the portal, they need to move west, then north, then west again. But the user is stuck in the laundry place. Maybe they need to open the portal first. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the user should try going north from the laundry place. The cookhouse is north, but the user was there before. However, in the cookhouse, there's an exit to the west (laundry place) and maybe other exits. The user needs to find the correct path.

But the user is in the laundry place, and the portal is closed. The user needs to find a way to open it. Since the user hasn't picked up the latchkey yet, maybe they need to go to the kitchen to get it. But how?

The user's next action should be to open the portal. But the portal is closed. Maybe they need to use the latchkey. But the latchkey is in the kitchen. So the user needs to find the kitchen first.

Alternatively, maybe the user should try going east again. But when they tried east, they went to the cookhouse, then tried south but couldn't. Then they went west back to laundry. So maybe the correct next step is to go north from the laundry place. Let's check the available exits again. In the laundry place, the exits are north, east, south, and west (portal). The user is stuck in the laundry place, so maybe they need to go north to the cookhouse again. But the cookhouse has an exit to the west (laundry place) and maybe other exits. The user needs to find the right path.

But the user's goal is to open the portal. So maybe the user should try opening the portal now. But the portal is closed. The user might need to use the latchkey. However, the latchkey is in the kitchen. So the user needs to go to the kitchen first.

But how to get to the kitchen? The user is in the laundry place. The exits are north (cookhouse), east (cookhouse?), south (unknown), west (portal). Maybe the user needs to go north to the cookhouse, then find another exit. The cookhouse has an exit to the west (laundry place) and maybe other directions. The user needs to find the correct path.

Alternatively, maybe the user should try going south from the laundry place. But when they tried that, they couldn't. So perhaps the user needs to find another way. The user is stuck in a loop, so they need to try a different action. The previous actions were go east, go south (failed), go west (back to laundry). The next step should be to open the portal, even though it's closed. Maybe the user needs to use the latchkey to open it. But the latchkey is in the kitchen. So the user needs to go to the kitchen first.

But how? The user is in the laundry place. The exits are north, east, south, west. The user needs to find the kitchen. Maybe the cookhouse is part of the path. The user needs to go north to the cookhouse, then maybe east or south to find the kitchen.

But the user is stuck in the laundry place. The correct next action is to open the portal, even though it's closed. The user might need to use the latchkey. But since the latchkey is in the kitchen, the user needs to get there first. So the user's next step is to go north to the cookhouse, then find a way to the kitchen.

But the user's previous action was going west, which brought them back to the laundry place. So the next step is to try opening the portal. However, the portal is closed. The user might need to find a key. But the user hasn't found any keys yet. The latchkey is in the kitchen. So the user needs to go to the kitchen first.

Therefore, the next action should be to go north from the laundry place to the cookhouse, then find a way to the kitchen. But the user is in the laundry place, so the next step is to go north.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through the game to pick up the latchkey from the kitchen and win. So far, they've gone through several rooms: basement, garage, laundry place, cookhouse, and now they're in the closet. The current room is the closet, which has an opened chest and some exits.

The goal steps are: go east, north, open portal, west, north, west, pick up latchkey from kitchen, then win. The user has already opened the portal in the laundry place and moved west to the cubicle, then north to the closet. Now, they need to find the kitchen. The closet has a west exit leading to a gateway. Maybe that's part of the path to the kitchen. The user needs to continue moving west from the closet. The next step would be to go west again. But the user might be stuck in a loop if they keep going back. However, the kitchen is likely in a different direction. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check the exits again. The closet has a south exit, but that's probably back to the cubicle. The west exit is a gateway. Maybe that leads to the kitchen. So the next action should be to go west from the closet.

There is an open gateway leading east. There is an open passageway leading north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

There is a latchkey on the floor.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the kitchen and needs to pick up the latchkey from the floor. They tried "take latchkey from floor" but got an error. Maybe the correct command is just "take latchkey" without specifying "from floor" since the key is on the floor by default. Alternatively, maybe the key is in a container, but the description says it's on the floor. So the next step is to try taking the latchkey directly. The user's previous actions led them here, so the next command should be "take latchkey".
