Welcome to TextWorld! Here is how to play! First of all, you could, like, venture south. Okay, and then, recover the bug from the floor of the closet. Alright, thanks!

-= Vault =-
You find yourself in a vault. A normal one.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the south. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

-= Closet =-
You've entered a closet. Let's see what's in here.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a durian and a bug on the floor.

That's not a verb I recognise.

You can't see any such thing.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in the closet trying to take the bug. They tried "take the bug from the floor" multiple times, but it's not working. The goal is to recover the bug from the floor of the closet.

First, I need to recall the game's objective. The user has to go south into the closet, then recover the bug. So far, they've entered the closet, but can't take the bug. The problem is that the game isn't recognizing the action. Maybe the correct command is different. 

In TextWorld, sometimes you have to use specific verbs. The user tried "recover" and "take", but the game didn't accept it. Maybe the correct verb is "take" without the "from the floor" part? Or maybe "pick up" the bug. Alternatively, perhaps the bug is in a different location. Wait, the description says there's a durian and a bug on the floor. So the bug is on the floor. The correct action might be "take the bug" or "pick up the bug". 

But the user tried "take the bug from the floor" and it didn't work. Maybe the game expects just "take the bug" since it's already on the floor. Or maybe the command is "get the bug". Alternatively, maybe the user needs to look around first to see the bug. But the description already mentions the bug is on the floor. 

So the next step is to try a different verb. Since "take" isn't working, maybe "get" or "pick up". Let's try "get the bug". If that doesn't work, maybe "pick up the bug". Alternatively, maybe the bug is in a container, but the description says it's on the floor. 

The user is in a loop because they keep trying the same action. The key is to find a synonym or different phrasing. The correct command might be "take the bug" without specifying the floor. Let's try that.
