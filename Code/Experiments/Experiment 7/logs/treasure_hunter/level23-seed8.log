Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First off, move east. Then, go south. And then, make an attempt to go west. Then, attempt to venture west. And then, go west. Then, make an effort to travel south. Then, pick up the spork from the floor of the cookery. And once you've done that, you win!

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in a text adventure game. The goal is to move east, then south, then west, then west again, then south, pick up the spork, and win. But the user is stuck in a loop between the Playroom and Laundry Place.

First, I need to recap the goal. The steps are: go east, south, west, west, south, pick up spork. But the user has already gone east, south, west, west, south, and is now back in the Laundry Place again. The problem is that the user keeps looping between the Playroom and Laundry Place when trying to go south from the Laundry Place.

Looking at the current position, the user is in the Laundry Place, which has an exit to the east. The Playroom has exits to the north, east, and west. The Laundry Place's exit to the east leads back to the Playroom. The user tried going south from Laundry Place but can't. So the next step should be to find the spork in the Laundry Place. The initial instructions mention picking up the spork from the floor of the cookery, but maybe the spork is in the Laundry Place now.

Wait, the user is in the Laundry Place. The original instruction said to pick up the spork from the cookery, but maybe the spork is in the Laundry Place. The user hasn't picked it up yet. So the next action should be to pick up the spork here. But the game might require the user to check the room for items. Since the user is in the Laundry Place, they need to look for the spork there. The previous steps didn't mention finding it, so maybe that's the missing part. The user needs to pick up the spork in the Laundry Place instead of the cookery. So the next action is to pick up the spork.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to follow a specific sequence of movements and pick up the spork. The steps are: go east, south, west, west, south, then pick up the spork. But the user is stuck in a loop between the Playroom and Laundry Place.

Looking at the current position, the user is in the Laundry Place again. They tried picking up the spork but couldn't see it. Maybe the spork is in a different location. The initial instructions mentioned the cookery, but the user is now in the Laundry Place. Perhaps the spork is here, but the game doesn't detect it. Alternatively, the user might need to check another room.

The user has already gone east, south, west, west, south, but keeps looping. The next step should be to find the spork. Since the user can't pick it up here, maybe they need to check another room. The Playroom has exits to the north, east, and west. Maybe the spork is in the Playroom. The user should go north from the Laundry Place to the Playroom and look for the spork there. But the user can't go north from Laundry Place, so they need to find another way. Wait, the Laundry Place has an exit to the east, which leads back to the Playroom. The Playroom has an exit to the north, which might lead to another room. But the user can't go north from Laundry Place directly. So the solution is to go east to the Playroom, then north to another room where the spork is. But the user needs to check each room carefully. The key is to find the spork in the correct location and pick it up without getting stuck in loops.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the steps to win the game. The goal is to move east, then south, west, west, south, then pick up the spork. But they're stuck in a loop between the Playroom and Laundry Place.

Looking at their current position, they're in the Playroom again. They tried picking up the spork here, but it's not there. The spork was mentioned to be in the cookery, but maybe the user needs to check other rooms. The Shower room had a box, maybe the spork is there? Wait, the user was in the Shower room earlier, but didn't pick up anything. Alternatively, maybe the spork is in the Cookhouse or another room they've passed through.

The user has already gone through several rooms but hasn't found the spork. The next step should be to check the Shower room again where the box is. Since the user is in the Playroom now, they can go east to the Shower room again and check the box for the spork. That's the logical next move to find the spork and complete the game.

Looking at their current position, they're in the Cookhouse again. The spork was supposed to be in the cookery, but the user hasn't found it yet. The previous attempts to pick it up from various rooms didn't work. Maybe the spork is in the Cookhouse, and the user needs to check there. The Cookhouse has an exit to the west, which might lead to the Playroom again. But the user needs to look for the spork in the Cookhouse instead of moving around.

The next step should be to check the Cookhouse for the spork. Since the user is here, they should look around to find it. If they can't see it, maybe they need to interact with the environment differently. The key is to find the spork in the correct location and pick it up without getting stuck in loops.

Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is stuck in a loop between the Playroom, Cookhouse, and other rooms, trying to pick up the spork. The goal is to follow specific movements and then pick up the spork. But the spork isn't visible in any of the rooms they've checked.

First, the goal steps are: go east, south, west, west, south, then pick up the spork. The user has done most of the movement but is stuck in a loop. The spork must be in a room they haven't checked thoroughly. Maybe the spork is in the Cookhouse, but they didn't look仔细 enough. Alternatively, maybe the spork is in a different room they passed through, like the Studio or Shower.

The user has tried going east, south, west multiple times but hasn't found the spork. The next step should be to check the Cookhouse again, as that's where the spork was supposed to be. They might need to look around more carefully or interact with objects there. Since the previous attempts to pick it up failed, maybe they need to use a different command or check another location. But since the game is stuck in a loop, the solution is to find the spork in the Cookhouse and pick it up.

Well, here we are in the cookhouse.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

There is an open gate leading south. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

I am so happy to announce that you are now in the laundry place. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

<think>
</think>I'm stuck in a loop between the Playroom and Laundry Place. I've followed the movement steps but can't find the spork. I need to break the loop and find the spork in the Cookhouse. I'll try going west from the Cookhouse.

go west

That's not a verb I recognise.

-= Playroom =-
You are in a playroom. It seems to be pretty standard here. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.



There is an open gate leading south. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.
