Following that, venture west. After that, venture north. And then, make an effort to venture west. With that over with, head south. With that done, travel west. Then, move north. Then, make an effort to go north. Then, attempt to take a trip north. Okay, and then, try to go to the east. With that accomplished, take a trip north. With that done, pick-up the durian from the floor of the dish-pit. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Studio =-
Ah, the studio. This is some kind of studio, really great ordinary vibes in this place, a wonderful ordinary atmosphere. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

You can see a mantle. The mantle is normal. However, the mantle, like an empty mantle, has nothing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is a closed type H gateway leading west. There is an open door leading north.
