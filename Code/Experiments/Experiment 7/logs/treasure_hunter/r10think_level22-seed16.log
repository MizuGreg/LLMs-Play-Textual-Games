I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! First, it would be a great idea if you could make an attempt to take a trip east. Then, make an effort to travel north. That done, move north. Following that, move west. And then, pick-up the stick of butter from the floor of the kitchenette. That's it!

-= Cellar =-
You are in an usual kind of place. That is to say, you're in a cellar. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a rack. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing hasn't got anything on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the rack. You can make out a workbench. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Hm. Oh well

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

-= Office =-
You find yourself in an office. A typical kind of place.

A closed coffer is right there by you.

There is an open door leading east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Pantry =-
You arrive in a pantry. A standard kind of place.

You scan the room for a stand, and you find a stand. The stand is typical. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.

There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

-= Dish-Pit =-
You've just sauntered into a dish-pit. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

Look over there! a freezer. You shudder, but continue examining the room.

There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.



>                                                                                                                                -= Dish-Pit =-0/4

-= Kitchenette =-
Well, here we are in a kitchenette.

You can make out a locked cabinet close by.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

There is a stick of butter on the floor.
