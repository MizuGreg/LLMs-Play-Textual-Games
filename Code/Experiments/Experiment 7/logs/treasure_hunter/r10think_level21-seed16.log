Welcome to another exciting game of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First, it would be great if you could attempt to head north. After that, travel west. With that done, pick up the stick of butter from the floor of the kitchenette. Got that? Good!

-= Pantry =-
You arrive in a pantry. A standard kind of place.

You scan the room for a stand, and you find a stand. The stand is typical. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.

There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

-= Dish-Pit =-
You've just sauntered into a dish-pit. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

Look over there! a freezer. You shudder, but continue examining the room.

There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

-= Kitchenette =-
Well, here we are in a kitchenette.

You can make out a locked cabinet close by.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

There is a stick of butter on the floor.
