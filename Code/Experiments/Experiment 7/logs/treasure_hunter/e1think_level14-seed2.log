Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First, it would be fantastic if you could try to move south. Next, venture east. With that over with, go to the south. And then, go to the west. If you can manage that, retrieve the latchkey from the floor of the studio. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Kitchen =-
You've entered a kitchen. Let's see what's in here.

You see a plate. The plate is ordinary. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is an open portal leading north. There is an unguarded exit to the east. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

-= Workshop =-
You arrive in a workshop. An ordinary one.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and collect items. The goal is to retrieve the latchkey from the studio and then win.

First, the initial steps: the user started in the kitchen, moved south to the workshop. Now, they're in the workshop. The workshop has an exit to the east and unguarded exits north and south. The next step according to the original plan was to go to the south again, but that might not be helpful. Wait, the user's task was to move south, then east, then south again, then west. But in the workshop, moving south would take them back to the kitchen? Or maybe to another room?

Wait, the initial directions were: move south (from kitchen to workshop), then east, then south, then west. But in the workshop, the exits are east, north, and south. So maybe moving south from the workshop would take them back to the kitchen? But the user already came from the kitchen to the workshop by going south. So maybe moving south again would loop back. That's a problem. The user needs to avoid loops.

So the original plan might have a loop. The user needs to find a way to get to the studio where the latchkey is. The studio is probably in a different direction. Maybe the workshop's east exit leads to another area. Let me check the previous steps again.

In the kitchen, the user went south to the workshop. Then, in the workshop, the exits are east, north, and south. The user needs to go east from the workshop. Let's try that. Going east from the workshop would take them to another room, maybe the studio? Or another area. Then, from there, they can proceed to the south and west as per the original plan.

Wait, the original task was: move south (kitchen to workshop), then east, then south, then west. But after moving south to the workshop, the next step is to go east. So from the workshop, go east. Then, from that new room, go south. Then west. But the user is currently in the workshop, so the next action should be to go east. Let me check the current state again.

Current location: Workshop. Exits: east, north, south. The user's next step should be to go east. Then, from the east exit, maybe they reach the studio. Then, from there, go south and west. But the user needs to collect the latchkey from the studio's floor. So the plan is to navigate to the studio, pick up the latchkey, and then win.

So the next action is to go east from the workshop. That's the next step in the original plan. The user hasn't done that yet. So the correct next command is "go east".

-= Spare Room =-
You are in a spare room. A standard one. You begin looking for stuff.

You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a shelf. But there isn't a thing on it.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in TextWorld to complete their task. The goal is to move south, then east, then south again, then west, retrieve the latchkey from the studio, and win.

First, they started in the kitchen, went south to the workshop. Then they went east to the spare room. Now, they're in the spare room. The next step according to the initial instructions was to go west. But the user hasn't done that yet. Wait, the initial task said after going east, go south again, then west. But in the current room (spare room), the exits are east, north, south, west. So maybe the next step is to go west from here. But the user's previous action was going east, so maybe they need to go west now. But the user's last action was "go east", leading to the spare room. Now, the next step should be to go west to follow the initial plan. However, the user might be stuck in a loop if they keep moving between rooms without progressing towards the studio. But the task says to go south, east, south, west. So from the spare room, going west would be the next step. But the user needs to check if that's the correct direction. Alternatively, maybe they need to go north or south first. Wait, the initial plan was: move south (from kitchen to workshop), then east (to spare room), then south again (to maybe another room), then west. So from the spare room, going south would be the next step. But the user is in the spare room, and the exits include south. So maybe the next step is to go south. But the initial plan says after going east, go south. So from the spare room, go south. Then, after that, go west. So the next action should be "go south" from the spare room. But the user's previous action was "go east", so the next step is to go south. But the user might be confused. Let me check the current room: Spare Room. Exits are east, north, south, west. The goal is to go south, east, south, west. So after east (to spare room), next is south. So the next command should be "go south". But the user's last action was "go east", so the next step is to go south. Then, after that, go west. So the next action is "go south".

-= Steam Room =-
You find yourself in a steam room. A typical one.

You can make out a box, so there's that. You make out a rack. The rack is typical. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can see a table. The table is normal. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in TextWorld to complete their task. The goal is to move in specific directions: first south, then east, then south again, then west. After that, they need to retrieve the latchkey from the studio's floor.

Looking at the current scenario, the user is in the Steam Room. The previous moves were: Kitchen -> Workshop -> Spare Room -> Steam Room. The directions available here are east, north, and west. The user needs to continue moving according to the original plan. The next step after the Steam Room would be to go west, as per the initial instructions. But wait, the user's task says after moving south, east, south, and west, they need to get the latchkey. So maybe after moving west, they'll be in the studio. But the current room is Steam Room, so the next move should be west as per the original plan. However, the user might be stuck in a loop if they keep moving between rooms without progressing. But according to the instructions, they need to follow the sequence: south, east, south, west. So from Steam Room, the next step is west. But the user has to check if that's the correct direction. The Steam Room's exits are east, north, west. So going west would be the next step as per the plan. The user needs to go west to proceed.

-= Studio =-
You've just shown up in a studio. You can barely contain your excitement.

Oh, great. Here's a stand. The stand appears to be empty.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

There is a latchkey on the floor.

Okay, let's see. The user's goal is to follow specific movement directions and then retrieve the latchkey from the studio. So far, they've moved south from the kitchen to the workshop, then east to the spare room, south again to the steam room, and west to the studio. Now they're in the studio, which is the final destination mentioned in the task.

The current room is the studio, and the latchkey is on the floor here. The next step according to the task is to retrieve the latchkey. The user needs to pick it up. The previous actions have already taken them to the studio, so the next logical step is to pick up the latchkey. There's no mention of needing to move again once they're here, so the command should be to take the latchkey.
