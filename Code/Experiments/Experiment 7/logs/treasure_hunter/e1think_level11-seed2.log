Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an fast paced round of TextWorld? You do! Your first objective is to try to go west. And then, pick up the latchkey from the floor of the studio. Alright, thanks!

-= Steam Room =-
You find yourself in a steam room. A typical one.

You can make out a box, so there's that. You make out a rack. The rack is typical. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can see a table. The table is normal. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

-= Studio =-
You've just shown up in a studio. You can barely contain your excitement.

Oh, great. Here's a stand. The stand appears to be empty.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

There is a latchkey on the floor.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and collect items. The goal is to go west from the steam room into the studio, pick up the latchkey, and probably reach a final objective, though it's not explicitly stated here.

First, the user's current location is the Studio. They see a latchkey on the floor. The previous action was "go west" from the Steam Room to the Studio. Now, the next step is to pick up the latchkey. But the user needs to make sure they're not stuck in a loop. Since they just arrived in the Studio and the latchkey is there, picking it up should be the next logical step. The user should check if there's a way to proceed further after that. The instructions mention breaking loops by using synonyms if needed, but here, the action seems straightforward. So the next command should be to pick up the latchkey.
