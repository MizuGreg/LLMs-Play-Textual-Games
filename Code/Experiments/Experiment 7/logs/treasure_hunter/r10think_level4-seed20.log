It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to head east. And then, pick-up the loaf of bread from the floor of the garage. Alright, thanks!

-= Sauna =-
Ah, the sauna. This is some kind of sauna, really great normal vibes in this place, a wonderful normal atmosphere. And now, well, you're in it.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

There is a keycard on the floor.
