Welcome to another life changing round of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to make an attempt to venture north. That done, move north. Then, take a trip west. Following that, make an effort to head west. Then, take the paper towel from the safe. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in a study room, and they tried to go west multiple times but can't. The original goal was to go north, then west, then take a paper towel from a safe. But after going north to the study, trying to go west isn't possible. Maybe the study has different exits. The user needs to find another way to reach the safe. Since west isn't working, maybe check other directions like south or east. The exit to the south is unblocked, so perhaps going south from the study would be the next step. Then, after moving south, look for the safe and take the paper towel. That makes sense.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to venture north, then west, take a paper towel from a safe. But they kept getting stuck trying to go west in the study. So, the problem is that after going north to the study, they can't go west. The previous attempts to go west were unsuccessful, leading to a loop between the study and the office.

First step: The goal is to go north, then west, then take the paper towel. But in the study, west is blocked. So maybe the safe is in the study, and the user needs to open the case. The initial instructions mentioned a closed box in the corner. Maybe the paper towel is inside that case. So the next step is to open the case.

Second step: The user has already gone north to the study. They tried west but couldn't. Now, they need to check the case in the study. The exit to the south is unblocked, but that's back to the office. The main task is to open the case and take the paper towel.

Third step: The loop is between the study and office. The user can't go west, so instead of trying west again, they should interact with the case. The correct action is to open the case, not move directions. So the next command should be to open the case.

FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Office and Study. The goal was to go north, then west, then take the paper towel from the safe. But in the Study, going west doesn't work. The case was opened but was empty. Maybe the paper towel is somewhere else.

First step: The main goal is to reach the safe and take the paper towel. So far, the user went north to the Study, tried west but couldn't, checked the case which was empty. Now they're back in the loop.

Second step: The user has tried going north and south repeatedly, which isn't helping. The next step should be to look for another way to get to the safe, maybe by checking other objects or exits.

Third step: The loop is between Office and Study. The user needs to break it by trying a different action. Instead of moving, maybe they need to interact with the box again or check other areas. Since the case was empty, maybe there's another item or a different exit.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to find the paper towel from the safe. They've been moving around different rooms like the Office, Study, Cubicle, Closet, and Kitchen. But they haven't found the safe yet. The goal is to take the paper towel from the safe.

First step: The main goal is to locate the safe and take the paper towel. So far, the user has explored several rooms but hasn't found the safe. They need to check all possible areas.

Second step: The user has been moving between rooms, but maybe they missed a place where the safe is. The Closet had an exit to the north, which led to the Kitchen. Maybe the safe is in one of these rooms. They need to check the Kitchen or other areas.

Third step: The user is in a loop between rooms, so they need to try a different approach. Instead of just moving, they should look for clues or check items in the current room. In the Kitchen, there's a freezer and refrigerator. Maybe the paper towel is there. Alternatively, the safe might be in the Closet. They should check the Closet again or look in the Kitchen.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Office and Study. The goal is to take the paper towel from the safe. So far, they've checked the case and box in the Study, but they're empty. The user needs to find another way to access the safe.

First step: The main goal is to find the safe and take the paper towel. So far, the user has gone north to the Study, checked the case and box, but nothing. They need to look elsewhere.

Second step: The user has been moving between north and south, which isn't working. The next step should be to check other rooms or items. Maybe the safe is in the Closet or Kitchen. They need to explore those areas.

Third step: The loop is between the Office and Study. The user needs to break it by trying a different action. Instead of moving, maybe they need to check the Closet or Kitchen for the safe. Since the case was empty, maybe the safe is in another location.

There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

Okay, so you're in an attic, cool, but is it usual? You better believe it is.

-= Sauna =-
You've just sauntered into a sauna.

You make out an opened normal looking safe in the room. The safe contains a paper towel. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to take the paper towel from the safe. They've been moving through various rooms, eventually reaching the Sauna where the safe is located. The safe is open and contains the paper towel. The next step is to take the paper towel.

First step: The main goal is to take the paper towel from the safe. The user has already found the safe in the Sauna. So the next step is to pick it up.

Second step: The user is in the Sauna, which is part of the game's environment. They need to interact with the safe to take the paper towel. The previous actions led them here, so the next command should be to take the paper towel.

Third step: The user is not in a loop anymore since they've found the safe. The correct action is to take the paper towel, which is the final step in the game.
