THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to move north, then north again, then east, then south, pick up the passkey, and win. So far, they've gone north from the studio to the laundromat, then north again to the shower, then south back to the laundromat, then north again to the shower. Now they're in the shower again, and the next step was to go east, which took them to the cellar. Now they're in the cellar, and the next step is to go west, but that's where they came from. Wait, the user just tried going east again, but maybe they're stuck in a loop between the shower and cellar.

Wait, the current location is the cellar. The previous action was going east from the shower to the cellar. The cellar has an exit to the south (unguarded) and suggests going west. But the user is in the cellar, and the next step is to go west, which would take them back to the shower. But they already did that. So maybe they need to find the passkey in the cellar. The original plan was to pick up the passkey from the floor of the chamber. But the current location is the cellar. Maybe the passkey is here. The user hasn't picked it up yet. So the next step is to check the floor for the passkey. If they find it, pick it up. Then go south to the laundromat, then north to the shower again, then east to the cellar, but that's not helpful. Wait, the original plan was after going south, pick up the passkey. But the user is in the cellar now. Maybe the passkey is in the cellar. So the next action should be to pick up the passkey here. Then proceed to the next steps. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next step is to pick up the passkey from the floor in the cellar. Then go south to the laundromat, then north to the shower, then east to the cellar again? Wait, maybe the passkey is in the laundromat. Wait, the initial steps were: studio -> laundromat -> shower -> laundromat -> shower -> cellar. The passkey was supposed to be in the chamber (maybe the laundromat or shower). But the user hasn't found it yet. So in the cellar, maybe there's no passkey. So perhaps the user is stuck in a loop between shower and cellar. The next action should be to check the floor for the passkey in the current location (cellar) and pick it up if present. If not, maybe try another direction. But the user is in the cellar, and the only exit is south. So maybe the passkey is in the laundromat or shower. But the user hasn't checked those areas. Alternatively, maybe the passkey is in the cellar. The user needs to pick it up here. So the next action is to pick up the passkey from the floor.
