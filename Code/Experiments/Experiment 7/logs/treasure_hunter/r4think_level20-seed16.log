Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, you could, like, make an effort to move east. Then, move south. Then, ensure that the hatch within the cellar is open. After that, head south. And then, open the portal. And then, attempt to head south. Then, move west. With that accomplished, make an effort to go to the north. Following that, go west. Then, pick up the peanut from the floor of the studio. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Canteen =-
You find yourself in a canteen. A typical one. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."

You can make out a platter. The platter is typical. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a table. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You think about smashing the table to bits, throwing the bits into a pit, etc, until you get bored.

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east.

There is a candy bar on the floor.

You've entered a pantry. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

An open chest is close by. The chest is empty, what a horrible day! Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. But the thing is empty. Look over there! a shelf. The shelf is normal. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

There is an open gate leading south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in TextWorld. The goal is to follow a series of steps to eventually pick up the peanut and win.

First, the initial steps were going east from the canteen to the pantry, then south to the cellar. They opened the hatch in the cellar. Now, the next step according to the original instructions was to head south again after opening the hatch. But the user is at the cellar, which has a closed hatch south and an open gate north. Wait, the user just opened the hatch, so maybe they need to go south through that hatch. But the current room is the cellar, and the next step after opening the hatch would be to go south through the hatch. Then, after that, open the portal, then go south again, west, north, west, pick up the peanut.

But the user's last action was opening the hatch. The current room is the cellar. The next step should be to go south through the hatch. However, the user might be stuck if they can't proceed. But according to the previous steps, after opening the hatch, they should go south. So the next action should be 'go south'. But the user might have already done that. Wait, the original instructions said after opening the hatch, head south. So the next step is to go south from the cellar. Then, after that, open the portal, etc.

But the user's current position is the cellar, having opened the hatch. So the next step is to go south through the hatch. Then, in the next room, open the portal. Then go south, west, north, west, pick up the peanut.

So the next action is 'go south' from the cellar. But the user might have already done that. Wait, the user's last action was opening the hatch. The current room is the cellar. The next step is to go south. So the next command should be 'go south'.

<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The user needs to follow a specific sequence of actions to win the game. The goal is to eventually pick up the peanut in the studio and win.

So far, the user has gone through several rooms: canteen → pantry → cellar → basement → kitchenette → cubicle → steam room. They opened the hatch in the cellar, opened the portal in the basement, went south again, then west to the kitchenette, north to the cubicle, and then west again to the steam room. 

The next step in the original instructions was to go west from the cubicle, but the user is now in the steam room. The steam room has a south and west exit. The next step according to the plan was to go west from the cubicle, but since they're in the steam room now, maybe they need to go west from here. But the original plan after the cubicle was to go west, then north, then west again to reach the studio. However, in the current location (steam room), the west exit leads to the cubicle, which might not be the right path. Wait, the user is in the steam room, which has a west door leading back to the cubicle. But the original plan was to go west from the cubicle to reach the studio. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Wait, the original steps after the cubicle were: "go west. Then, pick up the peanut from the floor of the studio." So after the cubicle, the user should go west to reach the studio. But in the current scenario, the user is in the steam room. So perhaps they need to go south from the steam room to the cubicle again, then west to the studio. But the user is already in the steam room, so the next step would be to go west to the cubicle again. But the user might be stuck in a loop between the steam room and cubicle. Alternatively, maybe the correct path is to go south from the steam room to the cubicle, then west to the studio. But the user hasn't reached the studio yet. 

Wait, the user is in the steam room. The steam room has a south exit (to the cubicle) and a west exit (to the cubicle as well? Wait, the steam room's description says: "There is an open gateway leading south. There is an open door leading west." So going west from the steam room would lead to the cubicle. But the user is already in the cubicle. Wait, no, the user just came from the cubicle to the steam room. So the steam room's west exit is back to the cubicle. So the user needs to go south from the steam room to the cubicle again, then west to the studio. But the original plan was to go west from the cubicle to the studio. So perhaps the user is in the steam room, needs to go south to the cubicle again, then west to the studio. But the user might be stuck in a loop between the steam room and cubicle. Therefore, the next action should be to go south from the steam room to the cubicle, then west to the studio. But the user is in the steam room now, so the next step is to go south to the cubicle again. However, the user might have already done that. Alternatively, maybe the correct path is to go west from the steam room to the cubicle, but that's where they came from. So perhaps the user needs to go south from the steam room to the cubicle again, then west to the studio. But the user is in the steam room, so the next action is to go south. But the user is in the steam room, so the next step is to go south to the cubicle, then west to the studio. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action is to go south from the steam room to the cubicle again. But the user might be in a loop here. Therefore, the next action should be to go south, even though it's the same as before, but maybe that's necessary to proceed.
