Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. Your first objective is to go to the east. With that done, attempt to go to the north. Then, make an effort to go to the east. And then, lift the sponge from the floor of the sauna. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Office =-
You arrive in an office. An usual kind of place. You start to take note of what's in the room.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded.
