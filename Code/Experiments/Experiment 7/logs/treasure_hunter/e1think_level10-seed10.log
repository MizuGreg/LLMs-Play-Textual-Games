You are now playing a life changing session of TextWorld! Here is how to play! Your first objective is to attempt to move south. Then, attempt to head west. After that, attempt to take a trip south. With that accomplished, try to take a trip east. And then, pick up the carrot from the floor of the bedchamber. Got that? Good!

-= Basement =-
You've entered a basement.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

-= Attic =-
You have entered an attic. Not the attic you'd expect. No, this is an attic. The room is well lit.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

There is a latchkey on the floor.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is playing a text-based game where they need to follow specific steps to reach the carrot in the bedchamber. The current scenario is in the Attic, and they need to figure out the next move.

First, the goal is to move south, then west, then south again, east, and pick up the carrot. So far, the user has gone south from the basement to the attic. Now, in the attic, the prompt says to try going north, south, or west. The user needs to choose the next direction.

The user's previous action was "go south", which took them to the attic. Now, they need to proceed. The next step in the original plan was to go west. But the attic has a latchkey on the floor. Maybe that's a clue. However, the user's next move should follow the initial steps: after entering the attic, the next step is to go west. But the prompt says to try going north, south, or west. The user needs to pick one. Since the initial plan was to go west after entering the attic, that's the next step. But the user might be in a loop if they keep going back and forth. However, the current prompt doesn't indicate a loop yet. The latchkey might be a red herring. So the next action should be west.
</think>go west

-= Spare Room =-
You find yourself in a spare room. A typical one.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing a text adventure game, and their goal is to follow a series of directions to reach the carrot in the bedchamber. Let me break down their current situation.

First, the initial objective was to move south, then west, then south again, east, and finally pick up the carrot. The user has already gone south from the basement to the attic, then west to the spare room. Now, in the spare room, the prompt says there's an exit to the east, and they need to go south.

Wait, the current room is the spare room. The user's next step according to the goal is to go south. But the prompt here says "You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south." So maybe the user needs to go south from the spare room. But the previous action was going west, so the next step should be south. However, the user might be stuck in a loop if they keep going back. Let me check the steps again.

The user's past actions: basement -> attic (south), then attic -> spare room (west). Now, in the spare room, the next step is to go south. But the prompt mentions an exit to the east. However, the goal says after going west, they need to go south again. So maybe the correct next step is south. But the user might have already been here before. Wait, the user is in the spare room now. The goal says after going west, they need to go south. So the next action should be south. But the prompt says "You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south." So the user should go south from the spare room. But the user might have already done that. Wait, the user's previous steps were: basement (south) -> attic (west) -> spare room. Now, in the spare room, the next step is to go south. But the prompt says there's an exit to the east. Maybe the user is supposed to go east first? Wait, the original goal was to go south, then west, then south, then east, then pick up the carrot. So after the spare room, the next step is south. But the user is in the spare room, and the prompt says there's an exit to the east. Maybe the user is supposed to go east first? Wait, no, the original steps were: first go south, then west, then south again, then east. So after the spare room, the next step is south. But the user is in the spare room, and the prompt says "You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south." So the user should go south. But the user might have already been here before. Wait, the user's previous steps were: basement (south) -> attic (west) -> spare room. Now, in the spare room, the next step is to go south. But the prompt says "You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south." So the user should go south. However, the user might be in a loop if they keep going back. But according to the steps, after going west to the spare room, the next step is to go south. So the correct next action is south. But the user might have already done that. Wait, the user hasn't gone south from the spare room yet. So the next action should be south. But the prompt says there's an exit to the east. Maybe the user is supposed to go east first? No, the original steps say after west, go south. So the correct next action is south. Therefore, the user should go south.

-= Chamber =-
Okay, so you're in a chamber, cool, but is it usual? You better believe it is. You begin looking for stuff.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing a text-based game where they need to follow specific steps to reach the carrot in the bedchamber. Let me break down the current situation.

First, the goal is to move south, then west, then south again, east, and pick up the carrot. So far, the user has gone south from the basement to the attic, then west to the spare room, then south to the chamber. Now they're in the chamber. The next step according to the original plan was to go east, but the current room's description mentions an exit to the east and suggests going north instead. 

Wait, the user's previous action was "go south" to get to the chamber. Now, in the chamber, the options are east and north. The original plan after the chamber would be to go east, but maybe the game is trying to guide them differently. However, the user's next move should follow the initial steps: after the chamber, the next step was supposed to be east. But the chamber's description says the east exit is unblocked. So maybe the correct next step is east. But the user might be stuck in a loop if they keep going back. Let me check the steps again.

Original steps: 
1. Move south (done from basement to attic)
2. Move west (done to spare room)
3. Move south (done to chamber)
4. Move east (next step)

But in the chamber, the prompt says "exit to the east is unblocked" and suggests going north. However, the user's next action should be east as per the original plan. But maybe the game is designed so that after the chamber, moving east leads to the next room where the carrot is. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go north first. Wait, the user's previous steps were south, west, south. Now in the chamber, the next step is east. The user's next command should be "go east" to proceed. But the system message says to not repeat actions if not recognized. However, the chamber's description does mention east is unblocked, so going east is the correct next step. Therefore, the answer should be "go east".

-= Bedchamber =-
Well, here we are in the bedchamber.



There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

There is a carrot on the floor.

Okay, let me try to figure out what the next step should be here. The user's goal is to pick up the carrot from the floor of the bedchamber. So far, they've moved through the basement, attic, spare room, and chamber, finally reaching the bedchamber. The current room has an exit to the north and west, and there's a carrot on the floor.

The previous actions were going south, then west, then south again, then east. Now they're in the bedchamber. The next step according to the goal is to pick up the carrot. But the user hasn't done that yet. The command should be to take the carrot. However, in TextWorld, sometimes you need to use the correct verb, like 'take' or 'get'. But the user's previous actions were all 'go' commands. Maybe the correct command here is 'take carrot' or 'get carrot'. But the system might expect a different phrasing. Let me check the history. The user's last action was 'go east' to reach the bedchamber. Now, the carrot is on the floor, so the next action should be to pick it up. The correct command would be 'take carrot' or 'get carrot'. But since the user has been using 'go' commands, maybe the system expects 'take' as the verb. So the next action is to take the carrot.
