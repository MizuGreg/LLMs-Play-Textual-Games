Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First off, make an attempt to move south. And then, pick up the napkin from the floor of the scullery. That's it!

-= Canteen =-
You are in a canteen. A standard kind of place.



There is an open portal leading north. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

>                                                                                                                                -= Canteen =-0/1
AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go south

-= Scullery =-
You arrive in a scullery. A standard one.

You make out a closed refrigerator here.

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

There is a napkin on the floor.
