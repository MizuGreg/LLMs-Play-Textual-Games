Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an life changing round of TextWorld? You do! Here is your task for today. First of all, make an effort to move east. After that, recover the butterfly from the box inside the workshop. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Chamber =-
You find yourself in a chamber. An ordinary one.



There is an open gateway leading south. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

go east

-= Workshop =-
You've just shown up in a workshop.

You can see a box. The box contains a butterfly. You make out a locker. You can see a portmanteau.

You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

That's not a verb I recognise.
