Welcome to another exciting episode of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to travel east. That done, make an effort to go south. And then, attempt to move south. And then, make an attempt to travel west. Okay, and then, pick up the desktop computer from the floor of the austere workshop. Got that? Good!

-= Cookhouse =-
Well, here we are in the cookhouse.

What's that over there? It looks like it's a board. The board is normal. The board appears to be empty. You think about smashing the board to bits, throwing the bits into a pit, etc, until you get bored.

There is an open passageway leading east. There is an open portal leading north. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

-= Vault =-
I just think it's great that you've just entered a vault. You can barely contain your excitement.



There is an open door leading south. There is an open passageway leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the east.

-= Closet =-
You've just shown up in a closet.



There is an open door leading north. There is an open gateway leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

-= Serious Cubicle =-
You arrive in a serious kind of place. That is to say, you're in a cubicle.

You make out a locked case right there by you. You can see a display. The display is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! What's that over there? It looks like it's a cabinet. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a desk. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well

There is an open gateway leading north. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

-= Austere Workshop =-
You find yourself in a workshop. An austere one.

You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a coffer.

There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

There is a desktop computer on the floor.
