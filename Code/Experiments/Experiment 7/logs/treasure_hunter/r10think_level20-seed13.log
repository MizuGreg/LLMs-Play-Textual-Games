Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First off, go west. Okay, and then, move south. Then, move west. With that done, go north. Once you manage that, make an attempt to go north. That done, venture east. And then, head north. After that, go to the west. With that done, look and see that the trunk within the attic is wide open. After pulling open the trunk, pick up the keycard from the trunk. And once you've done that, you win!

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user wants me to figure out the next move in the TextWorld game. The goal is to follow a series of directions to find a keycard in an attic trunk and then win. Let me recap the steps they've taken so far.

First, they started in the bar, went west to the laundromat, then south to the canteen, west to the closet, north to the chamber, and then north again to the scullery. Now they're in the scullery. The next step according to the initial instructions was to venture east and then head north. But after that, they needed to go west again to reach the attic.

Wait, the user's last action was going north from the scullery. The scullery's description mentions a case and a fridge, but no attic yet. The previous steps had them moving through different rooms, but they haven't reached the attic. The key is to find the right path to the attic. The directions mentioned going east from the chamber, then north, then west to the attic. But in the current scullery, the exits are east, north, and south. The user needs to go east from here, then north, then west to get to the attic. But maybe they're stuck in a loop? Let me check the previous steps again.

Wait, the user's path so far: bar → laundromat → canteen → closet → chamber → scullery. The next step should be east from the scullery. Then north from there. But the scullery's north exit leads back to the chamber? Or maybe not. The scullery's north exit is unguarded. If they go east from the scullery, that's the next step. Then from there, north again. But the user might be going in circles. However, the initial instructions said after venturing east and north, go west to the attic. So perhaps from the scullery, going east is the next step. Then north, then west. But the user is currently in the scullery. The next action should be east. Let me check the scullery's description again. The scullery has an exit to the east, which is unguarded. So the correct next step is to go east. Then from there, north, then west to the attic. So the next command should be "go east".

-= Studio =-
You find yourself in a studio. A typical one. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You make out a locked toolbox nearby. You can make out a closed bureau.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Attic and Scullery. They need to get to the trunk in the attic to pick up the keycard. The previous steps have them moving back and forth between these rooms.

First, the goal is to follow the path: west, south, west, north, east, north, west, then go to the attic, open the trunk, pick up the keycard, and win. But they've been going back and forth between the attic and scullery.

Looking at the current position, they're in the Scullery again. The exits are east, north, and south. The Attic is north from the Scullery, but they've already been there. Wait, maybe they need to go east from the Scullery to the Cookhouse, then west to the Attic again. But that's what they've been doing.

Wait, the trunk is in the Attic. The user needs to go to the Attic, find the trunk, open it, and take the keycard. But they keep looping between Scullery and Attic. The problem is that the Attic's description mentions a trunk, but maybe they haven't interacted with it yet. However, the previous steps didn't mention opening it. The user needs to go to the Attic, look for the trunk, and then open it. But in the current state, they're in the Scullery again. So the next step should be to go north to the Attic again, then check the trunk. But since they've already been there, maybe they need to find a different way. Alternatively, maybe the correct path is to go east from the Scullery to the Cookhouse, then west to the Attic, then north to the Studio, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, the initial instructions said after going north from the chamber, venture east, then north again. Maybe the user is missing a step here. Alternatively, perhaps the key is to go east from the Scullery to the Cookhouse, then west to the Attic, then north to the Studio, but that's not helpful. Wait, the user is in the Scullery, and the next step should be to go north to the Attic again. But they've already done that. Maybe they need to go east from the Scullery to the Cookhouse, then west to the Attic, then north to the Studio, but that's not the right path. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east from the Scullery to the Cookhouse, then north to the Studio, then west to the Attic. But the user is stuck in a loop. The correct action here is to go north from the Scullery to the Attic again, then check the trunk. Since the user is in the Scullery, the next command should be "go north" to reach the Attic once more. But they've already been there. However, maybe they need to interact with the trunk now. So the next step is to go north to the Attic, then open the trunk. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the answer is to go north again.
