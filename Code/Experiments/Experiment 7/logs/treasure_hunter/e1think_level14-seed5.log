Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First stop, make an attempt to go to the west. And then, make an attempt to venture north. After that, make an effort to venture west. Once you succeed at that, head south. And then, pick-up the chocolate bar from the floor of the chamber. Alright, thanks!

-= Bedroom =-
You arrive in a bedroom. An usual one.

You can see an opened box here. The box is empty! What a waste of a day! You see a coffer!

You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Cookhouse =-
Ah, the cookhouse. This is some kind of cookhouse, really great normal vibes in this place, a wonderful normal atmosphere. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.



There is an unguarded exit to the east. There is an unblocked exit to the north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and collect a chocolate bar. The current location is the Cookhouse. The goal is to follow the steps: go west, then north, then west again, then south, and finally pick up the chocolate bar.

First, I need to recall the previous steps. The user started in the Bedroom, went west to the Cookhouse. Now, in the Cookhouse, the available exits are east and north. The instruction says after going west, venture north. So the next step should be to go north. But the user's last action was "go west", and the current room is Cookhouse. The available exits are east and north. The user needs to go north next. But the prompt says after going west, venture north. So the next action is "go north". Then, after that, venture west again. Then south, then pick up the chocolate.

Wait, the user's current position is Cookhouse. The previous action was going west from Bedroom to Cookhouse. Now, the next step according to the initial instructions is to go north. So the next command should be "go north". Then, after that, go west again. Then south. Then collect the chocolate. But the user hasn't done any of those yet. So the next step is to go north. The user hasn't done that yet. So the answer should be "go north".

-= Study =-
You are in a study. A typical kind of place.



There is an unblocked exit to the south. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in TextWorld. The goal is to reach the chocolate bar in the chamber. Let me recap the steps taken so far.

First, they started in the Bedroom, went West to the Cookhouse. Then from Cookhouse, they went North to the Study. Now, in the Study, the exits are South and West. The previous actions were going West, then North. The next step in the original plan was to go West again, then South, and then pick up the chocolate.

But in the Study, the user can go South or West. If they go South, they'd return to the Cookhouse. But the original plan after Study was to go West again. Wait, but the Study's West exit might lead to another area. However, the user needs to find the chamber with the chocolate. Maybe the path requires moving West from the Study. But the user has to check if that's possible. Since the Study has a West exit, going West from here would be the next step. Then, after that, they need to go South to reach the chamber. But the user needs to make sure they're not looping. Since the previous steps were moving West and North, now moving West again from Study might be the next step. However, the user needs to check if that's the correct direction. Alternatively, maybe the West exit from Study leads to the chamber. But the original plan was to go West, then South. So the next action should be West from Study. But the user has to make sure that's the right move. Since the Study's West exit is unblocked, going West is the next step. Then, after that, go South to reach the chamber where the chocolate is. So the next command is West.

-= Kitchenette =-
I just think it's great that you've just entered a kitchenette.

You can see a freezer.

There is an open hatch leading north. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in a text-based game. The goal is to follow a specific path: go west, then north, then west again, then south, and finally pick up the chocolate bar.

So far, the user has moved from the Bedroom to the Cookhouse (west), then to the Study (north), then to the Kitchenette (west). Now, the next step according to the initial instructions was to go south from the Kitchenette. But the user hasn't done that yet. The current room is the Kitchenette, which has exits to the north, east, and south. The next step in the plan is to go south. However, the user might be stuck in a loop if they keep moving west again. But in the current room, the south exit is available. So the correct next action should be to go south. Let me check the previous steps again to make sure. The user has already gone west, north, west, and the next step is south. So the answer should be "go south".

-= Chamber =-
You make another one of your grand eccentric entrances into a chamber.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the north.

There is a chocolate bar on the floor.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in a text-based game. Their goal is to follow a specific path: start by going west, then north, then west again, then south, and finally pick up the chocolate bar.

Looking at the current room, they're in the Chamber, which has an exit to the east and north. The chocolate bar is on the floor here. The previous steps have already taken them through the Bedroom, Cookhouse, Study, and Kitchenette. Now they're in the Chamber, which is the fifth room. The next step according to the initial instructions is to go south after venturing west again. But wait, the user's last action was going south from the Kitchenette to the Chamber. Now, in the Chamber, they need to pick up the chocolate bar. But the instructions say after going west, then south, then pick up the chocolate. Wait, maybe I need to check the sequence again.

The original plan was: go west, then north, then west, then south, then pick up the chocolate. But in the current path, they've gone west (Bedroom -> Cookhouse -> Study -> Kitchenette -> Chamber). Now, from the Chamber, the next step should be south, but the Chamber already has an exit to the south? Wait, no. The Chamber's exits are east and north. Wait, the user's last action was going south into the Chamber from the Kitchenette. So now, in the Chamber, they need to go north or east. Wait, the original plan was after going west (third step), then south. But maybe the user is confused. However, the chocolate is in the Chamber, so the final step is to pick it up. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action should be to pick up the chocolate bar. But the game might require moving to the correct position first. Wait, the Chamber has the chocolate on the floor, so the user just needs to pick it up. But in the game's context, maybe they need to be in the Chamber and then take the item. Since the user is already in the Chamber, the next step is to pick up the chocolate. However, the initial instructions said after going south, pick up the chocolate. But in the current scenario, the user is in the Chamber, which is the fifth room. So the next action should be to take the chocolate bar. But the game might require using a specific command like 'take chocolate bar' or 'get chocolate bar'. However, the user's previous commands have been 'go' commands. But the problem is that the user's last input was 'go south', leading to the Chamber. Now, in the Chamber, the chocolate is present. So the correct next step is to pick it up. However, the user's instructions said to 'pick-up the chocolate bar from the floor of the chamber' as the final step. So the next action should be to take the chocolate. But the user's previous actions were all 'go' commands. So maybe the correct command here is 'take chocolate bar' or 'get chocolate bar'. But the user's previous responses have been 'go' commands. However, in the game's context, the correct action here is to pick up the item. So the next command should be 'take chocolate bar'.
