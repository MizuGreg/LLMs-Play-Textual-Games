Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First step, travel south. Once you manage that, try to take a trip west. If you can manage that, try to take a trip south. And then, try to head west. Then, head south. And then, head east. Then, make an attempt to go to the east. And then, attempt to head north. With that done, pick up the passkey from the floor of the spare room. Got that? Good!

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text-based game set in a laundromat and a bar. The goal is to navigate through different areas, follow specific directions, and eventually pick up the passkey from the spare room.

First, the initial steps mentioned in the task are to go south, then west, south again, west, south, east, east again, north, and then collect the passkey. The user has already taken the first step by going south from the laundromat to the bar. Now, in the bar, the available directions are north, east, south, and west. The next step according to the task is to go west. But the user is at the bar, so going west would be the next move. However, the current description of the bar says there's an exit to the west, so that's unblocked. So the next action should be to go west. But wait, the user might be in a loop if they keep going back and forth. But according to the task, after going south to the bar, the next step is to go west. So the correct next action is to go west from the bar. Then, after that, proceed as per the task's instructions. The user needs to make sure they follow each direction in order without getting stuck in a loop. Since the bar's west exit is unblocked, going west is the next logical step.

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. There is an unblocked exit to the south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in TextWorld. The goal is to follow a specific path: first go south, then west, then south again, west, south, east, east again, then north. After that, pick up the passkey from the spare room.

So far, the user started by going south from the laundromat to the bar. Then they went west to the bedchamber. Now, the next step according to the initial plan is to go south from the bedchamber. But looking at the current room description, the bedchamber has exits to east, south, and west. The user needs to go south from here. But the previous action was going west, so maybe the next step is to go south. However, the user might be getting stuck in a loop if they keep moving between rooms without progressing towards the spare room.

Wait, the initial steps mentioned going south, then west, then south again, west, south, east, east, north. So after the bedchamber, the next step should be south. Let me check the current room. The bedchamber's south exit is unblocked. So the next action should be go south. But the user might have already done that. Wait, the user's last action was going west to the bedchamber. So from the bedchamber, the next step is to go south. Then, after that, the plan is to go west again. But maybe the user is getting stuck here. Alternatively, maybe the path requires moving east or another direction. But according to the initial instructions, after the bedchamber, the next step is south. So the correct next action is go south. But the user might be in a loop if they keep moving between rooms without reaching the spare room. However, the user hasn't picked up the passkey yet, so they need to follow the path correctly. The next step is to go south from the bedchamber.

Okay, let me try to figure out what the user needs here. They're in a TextWorld game, and their goal is to follow a series of directions to reach the spare room and pick up the passkey. Let me recap the steps they've taken so far.

First, they started in the Laundromat, went south to the Bar. Then they went west to the Bedchamber, then south to the Workshop. Now, the current location is the Workshop. The next step in their original plan was to go west again, then south, then east, then north, and finally pick up the passkey.

Looking at the Workshop description, there are exits to east, north, south, and west. The user's next move should be to go west as per the original plan. But wait, the user just did go south from the Bedchamber to the Workshop. The next step in the original instructions was after going west from the Workshop. Wait, let me check the original task again.

Original task: First step, travel south. Then west, then south, then west, then south, then east, then north. Then pick up the passkey. So after the Workshop, the next direction should be west. But the user is currently in the Workshop. So the next action should be go west. However, the user might be in a loop if they keep moving between rooms without progress. But according to the directions, they need to follow the path: from Workshop, go west, then south, then east, then north. So the next step is go west from the Workshop. Let me check the current room's exits again. The Workshop has exits to east, north, south, and west. So going west is possible. The user hasn't done that yet. So the next command should be go west. But the user's previous action was go south, leading to Workshop. So the next step is go west. But the user might be repeating steps, so I need to make sure they aren't in a loop. However, according to the plan, this is the correct next step. So the answer should be go west.

-= Scullery =-
You arrive in a scullery. A typical kind of place. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You can make out a freezer.

There is an unguarded exit to the east. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to navigate through the TextWorld environment according to the given steps and eventually pick up the passkey from the spare room. So far, the user has moved through several rooms: Laundromat → Bar → Bedchamber → Workshop → Scullery. The next step in the original instructions was to go east, then east again, then north. But in the current room (Scullery), the available exits are east, north, south, and west. The user has been moving west, south, etc., but needs to follow the specific path mentioned.

Looking at the current room, the Scullery has an unguarded exit to the east, north, south, and west. The user's previous actions have been going west, south, etc. But according to the initial plan, after the Workshop, the next steps were to go east, then east again, then north. However, in the Scullery, the user might need to go east to proceed. But the user's last action was going west, so maybe they need to adjust. However, the user is in the Scullery, and the next step according to the original plan might be to go east. But the user needs to check if that's the correct direction. Alternatively, maybe the user is getting stuck in a loop and needs to try a different direction. But the main goal is to reach the spare room and pick up the passkey. The user needs to continue moving in the specified directions. The next step in the original plan after Scullery would be to go east, then east again, then north. But the user has to check the available exits. The Scullery's exits are east, north, south, west. So going east from Scullery would be the next step. But the user's previous action was going west, so maybe they need to go east now. However, the user might be in a loop if they keep going back and forth. But the original plan says to go east, then east again, then north. So the next action should be east. But the user is in Scullery, so going east would be the next step. Therefore, the next command is go east.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in TextWorld, following a specific path. The goal is to eventually pick up the passkey from the spare room.

First, I need to recall the initial steps. The user started by going south from the laundromat to the bar, then west to the bedchamber, south to the workshop, west again to the scullery, then east back to the workshop. Now they're back in the workshop again, which suggests they might be in a loop.

Looking at the current room (Workshop), the exits are east, north, south, and west. The user has already tried going west before, which led them back. The next step in the original plan was to go east, then south, then east again, then north. But they're stuck in a loop between the workshop and scullery.

The user's past actions include moving south, west, south, west, east. The next step should be to try a different direction. Since going west leads back to the scullery, maybe trying north or south again. But the original plan was to go east, then south, then east, then north. However, the user is stuck in the workshop. Maybe they need to go north from the workshop to proceed further.

Wait, the original task was: after moving south, west, south, west, south, east, then north. But the user is in the workshop again. Maybe they need to go north from here. Let me check the exits again. The workshop has exits to east, north, south, west. So going north from the workshop would be the next step. That's not been done yet. So the next action should be north.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in TextWorld, following a specific path. The goal is to eventually pick up the passkey from the spare room. Let me recap the steps they've taken so far.

Starting from the Laundromat, they went south to the Bar, then west to the Bedchamber, south again to the Workshop, east to the Scullery, then back east to the Workshop again. Then they went north to the Bedchamber again, and south back to the Workshop. Now they're in the Workshop again, which seems like they might be looping between the Workshop and Bedchamber.

The original plan was to go south, then west, then south, west, south, east, east, north. But they might have gotten stuck in a loop between Workshop and Bedchamber. The next step should be to break the loop. Instead of going south again, maybe try going west from the Workshop. Wait, the previous action was going north to the Bedchamber, then south back to Workshop. So now, from Workshop, the exits are east, north, south, west. The user has been going back and forth between those. To avoid looping, perhaps try a different direction. But the instruction says if previous actions didn't progress, use a synonym. So maybe instead of 'go south', try 'go west' again. But the user just did that. Wait, the last action was 'go south' to the Workshop again. So maybe the next step is to go west from the Workshop. But the user might be stuck in a loop between Workshop and Bedchamber. So the next action should be to go west from the Workshop, which is unblocked. Let me check the current room description. In the Workshop, the exits are east, north, south, west. So going west from Workshop would take them to the Scullery? Wait, no. Earlier, when they were in the Workshop, going west led to the Scullery? Or maybe not. Let me check the previous steps. The user went from Scullery east to Workshop. So from Workshop, west would be back to Scullery. But the user is in Workshop again, so going west would take them to Scullery. But the user's goal is to get to the spare room. Maybe they need to find the right path. Alternatively, maybe they need to go north from the Workshop to the Bedchamber again, but that's where they've been. Alternatively, go east to Scullery again. But the user's goal is to find the passkey in the spare room. Maybe they need to check if the passkey is in a room they've already visited. Wait, the initial task was to pick up the passkey from the floor of the spare room. So they need to find the spare room. The path mentioned was: after going south, west, south, west, south, east, east, north. But maybe the spare room is in a different location. Alternatively, maybe the user is stuck in a loop and needs to try a different direction. Since the previous actions have led back to the Workshop, perhaps the next step is to go east to the Scullery again, then maybe find a way to proceed. But the user's next action should be to go west from the Workshop, as that's the unblocked exit. But the user has already done that. Wait, the last action was 'go south' to the Workshop again. So the next step is to go west from the Workshop. But the user might be looping between Workshop and Scullery. So the next action should be 'go west' again. However, the user might need to try a different direction. But according to the instructions, if they're in a loop, they need to use a synonym. So maybe 'go west' is the correct next step.

But so far, they've been stuck in a loop between Workshop and Scullery. The current room is Scullery, and the previous action was going west from the Workshop to Scullery. The next step should be to go east back to the Workshop, but that's what they did before. However, maybe they need to find a different path.

Wait, in the Scullery, there's a freezer mentioned. Maybe the passkey is in the freezer? But the user hasn't checked there yet. Alternatively, maybe they need to go north from Scullery to exit to the Bar or another room. But the goal is to reach the spare room. Let me check the initial instructions again.

The initial task was: first step, travel south. Then west, then south, then west, then south, then east, then north. After that, pick up the passkey from the spare room. So after moving north, they should be in a room where the passkey is. But the user is currently in Scullery, which is room 0/9. The previous steps have them moving back and forth between Workshop and Scullery. Maybe they need to find a different path to reach the spare room without looping.

Alternatively, perhaps the passkey is in the Workshop. The user needs to check the mantelpiece or cabinet in the Workshop. But the user hasn't picked up anything yet. The goal is to pick up the passkey from the floor of the spare room. So maybe after moving through the required directions, they need to go to the spare room and pick it up.

But the user is stuck in a loop. The next action should be to break the loop. Since they've been going west and east between Workshop and Scullery, maybe they need to go north from Scullery to exit to the Bar or another room. Let me check the Scullery description again. In Scullery, the exits are east, north, south, and west. The user is currently in Scullery, and the previous action was going west from Workshop. So the next step should be to go north from Scullery to exit to the Bar. But the user might have already been there. Alternatively, maybe they need to go south from Scullery to the Workshop again, but that's the loop.

Wait, the user's goal is to eventually reach the spare room. The initial steps require moving south, west, south, west, south, east, north. Let me track their current position. The last move was west to Scullery (room 0/9). The previous steps were moving back and forth. To follow the initial instructions, after moving north, they should be in a room where the passkey is. But they need to get there without looping.

Alternatively, maybe the passkey is in the Workshop's cabinet or mantelpiece. But the user hasn't checked there yet. However, the task says to pick up the passkey from the floor of the spare room. So the user needs to find the spare room. Maybe the spare room is the Workshop or another room. But the initial steps don't specify where the spare room is. The user needs to navigate through the rooms as per the instructions and then find the passkey.

Given the current position in Scullery, the next step should be to go north to exit to the Bar, then proceed further. But the user might have already been there. Alternatively, maybe they need to go east from Scullery to the Workshop again, but that's the loop. The key is to break the loop by choosing a different direction. Since the user is in Scullery, going north is an option. Let's try that.

-= Kitchen =-
You've just walked into a kitchen.

You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a table. The table is ordinary. The table appears to be empty.

There is an unguarded exit to the east. There is an unblocked exit to the south. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is in a TextWorld game where they need to navigate through different rooms and eventually pick up the passkey from the spare room. The goal is to follow a specific path: go south, then west, then south again, west, south, east, east again, and then north. After that, they need to collect the passkey.

Looking at the current room, the user is in the Kitchen. The previous steps have been moving around between rooms like the Workshop, Bedchamber, Scullery, etc. The current room has exits to the east, south, and west. The user needs to continue following the path outlined in the initial instructions.

The next step in the original plan after reaching the Kitchen would be to go east, then east again, then north. But the user has to check if those directions are possible. The Kitchen has an unguarded exit to the east, so going east is possible. Then, from the next room (probably the Dining Room or something similar), they might need to go east again and then north. However, the user needs to make sure they're not looping and that each move is necessary.

Wait, the user has already been moving in a cycle between rooms. The initial instructions mention going south, west, south, west, south, east, east, north. So after the Kitchen, the next steps would be east (to the Dining Room?), then east again, then north to reach the spare room where the passkey is. But the user needs to confirm the exact path.

In the current Kitchen, the user should go east to proceed. The next room after the Kitchen is likely the Dining Room. From there, going east again might lead to another room, and then north to the spare room. However, the user needs to make sure they're not repeating steps that don't lead anywhere. Since the Kitchen's east exit is unguarded, going east is the correct next step. Then, from the Dining Room, east again, then north to reach the spare room. So the next command should be 'go east'.

-= Bedchamber =-
You've entered a bedchamber.

You scan the room, seeing a bed. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a bed? But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. You can see a couch. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The couch appears to be empty. Hm. Oh well

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. There is an unblocked exit to the south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

The goal is to follow a specific path: go south, then west, then south again, west, south, east, east again, and then north. After that, they need to collect the passkey.

Looking at the current room, the user is in the Bedchamber again. The previous steps have them moving back and forth between the Workshop, Scullery, Kitchen, and Bedchamber. It seems like they might be stuck in a loop, moving between these rooms without making progress towards the spare room where the passkey is. 

The user's last action was going east from the Kitchen to the Bedchamber. Now, in the Bedchamber, the available exits are east, south, and west. The goal is to get to the spare room, which is likely in a different part of the map. Since the user has already tried moving east, south, and west multiple times, maybe they need to find a different path or check if there's a hidden door or item they missed.

But according to the game's environment, the main challenge is to follow the specified path without getting stuck. The user needs to ensure they are moving in the correct sequence: south, west, south, west, south, east, east, north. However, the current position in the Bedchamber might not be the right place to proceed. Maybe they need to go south from the Bedchamber to reach the next room, which could be the Spare Room. But the previous attempts to go south led back to the Workshop. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user needs to check if there's a way to get to the Spare Room through another route. Since the goal is to pick up the passkey, the user must find the correct path that leads to the Spare Room. The loop might be because the user is moving between rooms without following the exact sequence required. The next step should be to go south from the Bedchamber to proceed further towards the Spare Room.

-= Workshop =-
You've entered a workshop.

Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a cabinet. You see a mantelpiece. The mantelpiece is usual. But there isn't a thing on it. You move on, clearly angry about TextWorld.

There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

The goal is to follow a specific path: go south, then west, then south again, west, south, east, east again, and then north. After that, they need to collect the passkey.

Looking at the current room, the user is in the Workshop. The previous steps have them moving back and forth between the Workshop, Bedchamber, Scullery, Kitchen, and back to the Bedchamber. It seems like they're stuck in a loop between these rooms. The instruction says to break the loop by using a different action if needed.

The next step after the last move was going south from the Bedchamber to the Workshop again. Now, the user is in the Workshop again. The directions here mention exits to the east, north, south, and west. The goal is to get to the spare room, which is likely the Kitchen or another room mentioned earlier. But the user hasn't found the passkey yet.

Wait, the original task mentioned going to the spare room to pick up the passkey. The user hasn't reached that yet. The current path might not be leading them directly there. Maybe they need to find a different route. Since they've been looping between rooms, perhaps they need to try a different direction. The last action was going south, which brought them back to the Workshop. Maybe instead of going south again, they should try going east or west from the Workshop to explore new areas.

But the user's previous actions have been moving east, west, south, and north repeatedly. The key is to find the correct path to the spare room. The initial instructions said to go south, then west, then south, west, south, east, east, north. But maybe the user is not following that exact path correctly. Alternatively, maybe the passkey is in the Kitchen, which they visited earlier. However, in the Kitchen, they fell onto a table, but there was nothing on it. The freezer in the Scullery might be a place to check.

Alternatively, perhaps the user needs to check all possible exits again. In the Workshop, the exits are east, north, south, and west. The user has already tried going west, which led to the Scullery, then north to the Kitchen, then east back to the Bedchamber. Maybe the correct path is to go east from the Workshop to the Kitchen, then check there for the passkey. But the user hasn't found it yet.

Wait, the original task said to pick up the passkey from the floor of the spare room. The spare room might be the Kitchen or another room. The user needs to find that room. Since they're in the Workshop, maybe going east to the Kitchen is the next step. But in the Kitchen, they fell onto a table. Maybe there's something there. Alternatively, the passkey could be in the Scullery's freezer. But the user hasn't checked that yet.

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go north from the Workshop to the Bedchamber again, but that's where they were before. It's possible they're stuck in a loop between the Workshop and Bedchamber. To break the loop, they need to try a different direction. The next action should be to go east from the Workshop, which was the previous step, but that led to the Kitchen. Maybe from the Kitchen, they can go south to the Scullery again, then check the freezer. But the user hasn't checked the freezer yet.

Alternatively, maybe the passkey is in the Workshop's mantelpiece, but the description says there's nothing on it. The user needs to check all possible locations. However, the user hasn't found the passkey yet, so they need to continue exploring. The next step would be to go east from the Workshop to the Kitchen, then check there. But the user is already in the Workshop, so the next command should be to go east.

I never took you for the sort of person who would show up in a spare room, but I guess I was wrong.



There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

There is a passkey on the floor.

Okay, let's see. The user's goal is to pick up the passkey from the floor of the spare room. Looking at the current environment, they're in the Spare Room, and the passkey is on the floor. The previous actions have led them here through a series of movements between different rooms. The current room description mentions the passkey is on the floor, so the next logical step is to pick it up.

The user's last action was going east, which led them to the Spare Room. Now, they need to pick up the passkey. The command should be "take passkey" or "pick up passkey". Since the game might expect a specific verb, "take" is more likely. So the correct command is "take passkey".
