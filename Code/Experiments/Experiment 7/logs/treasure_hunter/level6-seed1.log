Welcome to TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First step, attempt to go north. After that, try to take a trip north. After that, pick-up the passkey from the floor of the cookery. That's it!

-= Cookhouse =-
You arrive in a cookhouse. A typical one.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

-= Studio =-
This might come as a shock to you, but you've just entered a studio.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text-based game where they need to follow specific steps to reach the goal. The initial instructions said to go north, then take a trip north, pick up the passkey from the cookery, and that's it. 

First, the user started by going north from the cookhouse, which led them to the studio. Now, in the studio, the available directions are north, south, and west. The next step according to the original task was to "take a trip north," but maybe that's a bit ambiguous. However, the user is now in the studio, so perhaps they need to move in a different direction.

Looking at the current environment, the user is in the Studio. The original goal was to pick up the passkey from the cookery. But the user is now in the studio. Maybe they need to go back to the cookhouse or find another way to get the passkey. However, the passkey is supposed to be in the cookery, which is the starting point. 

Wait, the initial instructions said to first go north (from cookhouse to studio), then take a trip north (maybe from studio to another area?), then pick up the passkey from the cookery. But the cookery is the starting location. Maybe the passkey is in the studio now? Or perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the directions.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west from the studio to reach the cookery again. The original task said to pick up the passkey from the cookery's floor. So perhaps after moving to the studio, the next step is to go west back to the cookhouse, then pick up the passkey. But the user is in the studio, so the next action should be to go west. However, the user's previous action was going north, so maybe they need to go west now. 

But the user is in the studio, and the directions available are north, south, west. The original task said after going north, take a trip north again. Maybe that's a hint to go north again from the studio. But if that's a loop, then they need to try a different direction. However, the user is in the studio, and the cookery is the starting point. So perhaps the correct path is to go west from the studio back to the cookhouse, then pick up the passkey. But the user hasn't done that yet. 

So the steps so far: go north (from cookhouse to studio). Next step was to take a trip north, but that might not be possible. Alternatively, maybe "take a trip north" is a synonym for going north again. But if that's a loop, then the user needs to try a different direction. Since the user is in the studio, maybe the next step is to go west to return to the cookhouse, then pick up the passkey. However, the user hasn't done that yet. 

But the original instructions said to first go north, then take a trip north, then pick up the passkey. So maybe after going north to the studio, the next step is to go north again, but that might not be possible. Alternatively, maybe "take a trip north" is a different action, like moving north from the studio. But the user is in the studio, and the north direction is unblocked. So perhaps the user should go north again, but that might lead to a loop. 

Alternatively, the user might need to go west from the studio to return to the cookhouse, then pick up the passkey. But the original task said to pick up the passkey from the cookery's floor, which is the starting point. So maybe the correct sequence is: go north (to studio), then go west (back to cookhouse), then pick up the passkey. 

But the user is currently in the studio. So the next action should be to go west. However, the user's previous action was going north. So the next step is to go west. But the user needs to check if that's the correct direction. The original task said to take a trip north, but maybe that's a mistake. Alternatively, the user needs to go west to return to the cookhouse and pick up the passkey. 

Therefore, the next action should be to go west from the studio to the cookhouse, then pick up the passkey. But the user is in the studio, so the next command is "go west".

-= Spare Room =-
If you're wondering why everything seems so standard all of a sudden, it's because you've just shown up in the spare room.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

There is a keycard on the floor.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing a text-based game where they need to follow specific steps to win. The goal is to first go north, then take a trip north, pick up the passkey from the cookery floor, and that's it.

Looking at the current scenario, the user is in the Spare Room. The previous actions were going north and then west. Now, in the Spare Room, there's a keycard on the floor. The next step according to the original task was to pick up the passkey from the cookery. But wait, the user is in the Spare Room now. Maybe they need to go back to the cookery area to pick up the key.

Wait, the initial instruction said to pick up the passkey from the floor of the cookery. So the user must be in the cookery area. But in the current location, they're in the Spare Room. So perhaps they need to go back south to the Studio, then east to the Cookhouse, and then pick up the key there. But the user has already gone north and west. Let me check the steps again.

First step: go north (done). Then take a trip north (maybe that's another direction?). Then pick up the passkey from the cookery. But in the current room, the key is in the Spare Room. Wait, the user is in the Spare Room now, and there's a keycard on the floor. So maybe that's the passkey. So the next step is to pick up the keycard here. But the original task said to pick it up from the cookery. Hmm, maybe there's a mistake in the environment setup. Alternatively, maybe the key is here, and the user needs to take it. So the next action would be to take the keycard. But the user's previous actions were go north, go west. Now, in the Spare Room, the key is present. So the next step is to take the keycard. Then, perhaps go back to the cookery area. But the original task says to pick it up from the cookery. Maybe the key is here, so taking it would be the correct step. So the next action is to take the keycard.
