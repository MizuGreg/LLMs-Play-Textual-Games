You are now playing a exciting round of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. Your first objective is to venture east. And then, take a trip north. Next, retrieve the loaf of bread from the counter within the pantry. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Shower =-
You've just sauntered into a shower.

You can see a rack. But there isn't a thing on it.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.
