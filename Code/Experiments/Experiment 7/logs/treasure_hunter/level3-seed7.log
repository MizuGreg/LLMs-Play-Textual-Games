Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an life changing round of TextWorld? You do! Here is your task for today. First of all, attempt to travel north. And then, lift the key from the floor of the dish-pit. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Bedroom =-
Well how about that, you are in the place we're calling the bedroom.



There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

go north

-= Dish-Pit =-
Wow! You're in a dish-pit.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unblocked exit to the south. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

There is a key on the floor.

That's not a verb I recognise.
