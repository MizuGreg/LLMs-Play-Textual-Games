You arrive in a dish-pit. An usual kind of place. You begin looking for stuff.

You can see an opened refrigerator right there by you. The refrigerator is empty, what a horrible day! You can see a locked case in the room. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a bowl. However, the bowl, like an empty bowl, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You can see a shelf. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to win this game. The user's instructions say that the goal is to go north, then east, then south, then south again, then east, retrieve the frisbee from the closet, and then win. But so far, the player has been moving between the Kitchen and Dish-Pit areas, going back and forth between north and south, which seems like a loop.

Looking at the current position, the player is in the Dish-Pit again after trying to go south. The previous actions were going north and south repeatedly, which doesn't seem to be making progress toward the objective. The key steps mentioned in the initial instructions involve moving east and interacting with the closet to get the frisbee. However, the player hasn't tried moving east yet, even though there's an unblocked exit to the east in the Dish-Pit.

The problem is that the player is stuck in a loop between the Kitchen and Dish-Pit by going north and south. To break this loop, the player needs to try moving east from the Dish-Pit instead of continuing to go south. The next logical step would be to go east from the current position (Dish-Pit) to proceed further in the game. That way, they can follow the instructions correctly and eventually reach the closet to retrieve the frisbee.
