Okay, and then, go to the south. With that over with, make an attempt to take a trip west. And then, pick up the worm from the floor of the kitchenette. That's it!

You've entered a playroom.

You scan the room, seeing a shelf. The shelf is standard. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to proceed. The user's goal is to pick up the worm from the kitchenette and put it in a place. But so far, the movements have been looping between the basement, playroom, and bedroom. The worm hasn't been found yet.

Looking at the previous steps, the player has been going back and forth between the basement and the bedroom. The key is to find the kitchenette. The initial instruction mentioned going south, then east, then south again, but maybe that's not leading to the kitchen.

Wait, in the playroom description, there's a shelf, but it's empty. The basement has a workbench, but it's empty. The bedroom has a box. Maybe the worm is in the kitchenette, which is another room. But how to get there?

The user's last action was going east from the bedroom, which took them back to the basement. Maybe they need to go north from the basement to the playroom again, then try east again. But the playroom's east exit is unguarded. Alternatively, maybe the kitchenette is accessible from the basement via another path. But the basement's exits are north and south, which loop back. 

Wait, the initial instruction said to go south, then east, then south again, then west, then pick up the worm in the kitchenette. But the current position is in the basement. Maybe the kitchenette is in the playroom? But the playroom's shelf is empty. Or perhaps the worm is in the bedroom's box? But the user hasn't checked there yet.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to find a different path. Since the basement's exits are north and south, and the playroom's east is unguarded, maybe the kitchenette is east of the playroom. So the next step would be to go east from the playroom. But the user is currently in the basement. So the path would be: basement → playroom (south) → east. Then check the kitchenette there. But the user hasn't tried that yet. So the next action should be to go east from the playroom.
