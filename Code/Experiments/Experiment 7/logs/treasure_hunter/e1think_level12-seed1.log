Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, venture east. Then, venture north. Then, retrieve the passkey from the bench within the bathroom. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Cookhouse =-
Well, here we are in a cookhouse.



There is an open passageway leading east. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Closet =-
You arrive in a closet. A normal one.

You scan the room for a rack, and you find a rack. The rack is normal. But there isn't a thing on it. You see a workbench. However, the workbench, like an empty workbench, has nothing on it.

There is an open door leading north. There is an open passageway leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text-based game where they need to follow specific steps to win. The goal is to venture east, then north, retrieve the passkey from the bench in the bathroom.

First, the user started by going east, which took them to the Closet. Now, they need to go north from there. The Closet has a door leading north, so the next step should be to go north. But the user might be stuck in a loop if they keep moving between the Cookhouse and Closet. Wait, the initial instruction said to go east first, then north. The user already went east, so the next step is to go north from the Closet. Then, after that, they need to find the bathroom with the bench and get the passkey. But the current location is the Closet, so the immediate next action is to go north. Let me check the previous messages. The user was in the Cookhouse, went east to Closet. Now, the Closet's north door is open. So the next step is to go north. Then, from there, maybe they'll reach the bathroom. But the user hasn't retrieved the passkey yet. So the steps so far: east, then north. Next is north from Closet. Then, once in the next room, look for the bathroom and the bench. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next command is go north.
</think>go north

-= Bathroom =-
Of every bathroom you could have sauntered into, you had to walk into a standard one.

You can make out a closed dresser. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a bench. You see a passkey on the bench. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You make out a table. The table is ordinary. On the table you make out a bug.

There is an open door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to venture east, then north, retrieve the passkey from the bench in the bathroom, and win. So far, they've gone east from the cookhouse into the closet, then north into the bathroom. Now, in the bathroom, they need to get the passkey from the bench. The prompt says the passkey is on the bench, so the next step is to pick it up. But the current description mentions the bench is there, and the passkey is on it. So the action should be to take the passkey. Wait, but the user's previous action was going north, which led them to the bathroom. Now, they need to interact with the bench. The command should be 'take passkey' or 'get passkey'. But in the game's context, maybe 'take' is the correct verb. Let me check the previous interactions. The user was told to "retrieve the passkey from the bench", so the correct action here is to take it. The next command should be 'take passkey'.
</think>take passkey
