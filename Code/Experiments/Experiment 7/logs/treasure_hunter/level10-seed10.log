THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Spare Room and Chamber. The goal is to pick up the carrot from the bedchamber. So far, they've moved south, west, north, south, etc., but keep looping. The next step should be to find the bedchamber. Maybe the carrot is in there. But how? They need to exit the current area. The exit to the east is unblocked, but that's the Spare Room again. Wait, maybe they need to go east from the Chamber? The Chamber has an exit to the east, which is unblocked. But the user keeps going north and south, which are the same rooms. So the correct path is to go east from the Chamber to exit, then find the bedchamber. But the user is stuck in the loop. So the next action should be to go east from the Chamber.
</think>go east

-= Bedchamber =-
Well, here we are in the bedchamber.

There is a carrot on the floor.
