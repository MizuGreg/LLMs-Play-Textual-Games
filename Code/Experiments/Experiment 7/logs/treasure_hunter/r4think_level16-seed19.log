THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user's goal is to first go east, then north, then west, then north again, then west, and finally pick up the latchkey from the kitchen. So far, the user has gone east from the basement to the garage, then north to the laundry place, east again to the cookhouse, then tried north but couldn't, so went west back to laundry. Now they're back at the laundry place again.

Hmm, the next step after the laundry place would be to go south, as the prompt said. But the user is at the laundry place again. Wait, the previous steps might be looping. Let me check the steps again. The user needs to go east, north, west, north, west, then get the latchkey. But in the current position, maybe they need to go south from the laundry place to the cookhouse again? Or maybe there's another exit. Wait, the laundry place has an open portal west, but that's already been used. The user is at the laundry place again, so maybe they need to go south to the cookhouse again. But the cookhouse has an exit to the west. Maybe the user is stuck in a loop between laundry and cookhouse. So instead of going east again, maybe try south from the laundry place. But the user's last action was go east to cookhouse, then tried north which wasn't possible, so went west back. Now, from laundry place, go south to cookhouse again, then maybe find a way north from there? Or perhaps the latchkey is in the kitchen, which is part of the basement? Wait, the initial basement had a coffer, but the user hasn't picked up the latchkey yet. Maybe the kitchen is in a different area. Wait, the user needs to pick up the latchkey from the kitchen floor. So maybe after moving around, they need to find the kitchen. But the current path is looping between laundry and cookhouse. So the next step is to go south from the laundry place to the cookhouse again, then try north from there. But the cookhouse's north exit might be blocked. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west from the laundry place again, but that's the portal. Wait, the laundry place has an open portal west, but that's already been used. Maybe the user needs to go south from the laundry place to the cookhouse, then east to the laundry again? That's a loop. So the user is stuck in a loop between laundry and cookhouse. The next step is to try a different direction. Maybe instead of going east, go south from the laundry place. But the user is at the laundry place, so the options are west (portal), east (cookhouse), or south. The prompt said to try going south if the exit is unblocked. So the next action should be go south from the laundry place to the cookhouse again. Then, from the cookhouse, maybe try north again? But the user tried that before and couldn't. Wait, maybe the cookhouse has a north exit that's unguarded. Let me check the previous steps. When the user was in the cookhouse, there was an exit to the west. The user tried going north and couldn't. So maybe the cookhouse's north is blocked. So the user needs to find another way. Alternatively, maybe the kitchen is in the basement, but the user hasn't checked there yet. Wait, the initial basement had a coffer, but the user hasn't picked up the latchkey. The latchkey is in the kitchen. So maybe the user needs to go back to the basement, but the basement's exits are east and north. Wait, the user is in the laundry place now. So from laundry, go west to the portal, then maybe go south to the cookhouse again. Hmm, this is confusing. The user needs to get to the kitchen. Maybe the kitchen is in the basement. But the basement's north exit was unguarded. Wait, the user started in the basement, went east to garage, then north to laundry, then east to cookhouse, then west back to laundry. Now, maybe the user needs to go back to the basement via the west exit from the laundry place. Wait, the laundry place has an exit to the west (portal), which would take them back to the garage? Or maybe the portal leads to the basement? Wait, the initial basement had an exit to the east (garage) and north. The garage had an exit to the north (laundry place). So the laundry place's west exit would be back to the garage. Then, from the garage, the west exit would be back to the basement. So the user is in the laundry place, go west to garage, then west to basement. Then, from the basement, maybe the north exit leads to the kitchen? Wait, the initial basement had a coffer, but the user hasn't picked up the latchkey yet. The latchkey is in the kitchen. So maybe the user needs to go back to the basement, then north to the kitchen. But the basement's north exit was unguarded. So the user needs to go back to the basement, then north to the kitchen. But the user is currently in the laundry place. So the steps would be: from laundry place, go west to garage, then west to basement, then north to kitchen. But the user is stuck in a loop between laundry and cookhouse. So the next action is to go west from the laundry place to the garage, then west again to the basement, then north to the kitchen. But the user's current position is the laundry place. So the next action is go west (portal) to the garage. Then from garage, go west to basement. Then from basement, go north to kitchen. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next step is to go west from the laundry place.

Were you looking for a toolbox? Because look over there, it's a toolbox. The toolbox is empty, what a horrible day!

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to travel east, then north, west, north, west, and finally pick up the latchkey from the kitchen. So far, the user has moved through several locations: basement → garage → laundry → cookhouse → laundry again. Now they're in the cubicle. The cubicle has exits east, north, and south. The previous steps might have looped between laundry and cookhouse, but now they're in the cubicle. The next step should be to check if moving north from here leads to the kitchen. Since the user needs to get to the kitchen, maybe the cubicle's north exit leads there. Alternatively, the toolbox mentioned here might be part of the path, but the main goal is the latchkey. So the next action is to go north from the cubicle.

You've entered a closet.

You see an opened chest. What a letdown! The chest is empty!

There is an open hatch leading south. There is an open gateway leading west.

-= Kitchen =-
You're now in the kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You smell a sickening smell, and follow it to a freezer. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You make out a closed case, which looks normal, in the corner. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a table. The table is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open gateway leading east. There is an open passageway leading north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

There is a latchkey on the floor.
