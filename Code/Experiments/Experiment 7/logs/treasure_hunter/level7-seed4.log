Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First, it would be great if you could make an attempt to travel west. With that over with, take a trip north. That done, try to move north. And then, pick-up the knife from the floor of the cookhouse. Alright, thanks!

-= Pantry =-
You are in a pantry. A typical kind of place.



There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

There is a sock on the floor.

Guess what, you are in a place we're calling a parlor. The room is well lit.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text-based game where they need to follow specific steps to reach the goal. The initial instructions were to go west, then north, then north again, and finally pick up the knife in the cookhouse.

First, I need to recall the current environment. The user started in the pantry, went west to the parlor. Now, in the parlor, the possible exits are east, north, and possibly others. The next step according to the initial instructions was to go north again. But the user might be stuck in a loop if moving north doesn't lead them closer to the cookhouse.

Looking at the current location: the parlor. The user needs to move north to proceed. However, if moving north from the parlor leads back to the pantry or another room that's already been visited, that's a loop. The goal is to reach the cookhouse and pick up the knife. So, after the parlor, moving north might take them to the cookhouse. But the user has to check if that's the case.

Wait, the initial steps were: go west (from pantry to parlor), then north (from parlor to cookhouse?), then north again? Or maybe the cookhouse is north of the parlor. If the user is in the parlor and moves north, they might reach the cookhouse. Then, once there, they can pick up the knife. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next step after the parlor is to go north to the cookhouse. Then, pick up the knife. But the user's last action was going west, then the system responded with the parlor description. Now, the user needs to go north from the parlor to reach the cookhouse. So the next action should be "go north" again. But the user might have already done that. Wait, the original instructions said: "travel west. With that over with, take a trip north. That done, try to move north. And then, pick-up the knife..." So after west, go north once, then again north? Or maybe the cookhouse is north of the parlor. So from the parlor, going north would take them to the cookhouse. Then, once there, pick up the knife. So the next step is to go north from the parlor. But the user is currently in the parlor, so the next action is "go north".

-= Shower =-
This might come as a shock to you, but you've just moved into a shower. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text-based game where they need to follow specific steps to reach the goal. The initial instructions were to go west, then north, then north again, and finally pick up the knife from the cookhouse.

First, I need to recall the game's objective. The user's goal is to pick up the knife from the cookhouse. The current location is the shower, which is part of the game's environment. The previous actions were moving west from the pantry to the parlor, then north to the shower. Now, the user is in the shower and needs to proceed towards the cookhouse.

Looking at the current room description, there are exits to the east, north, and south. The user needs to find the cookhouse. Since the previous steps involved moving north from the pantry and parlor, maybe the next step is to go north again from the shower. However, the user might be in a loop if moving north doesn't lead them closer to the cookhouse. Alternatively, maybe moving south or east could be a better path.

But the user's goal is to reach the cookhouse and pick up the knife. The initial instructions mentioned moving north after going west. So, perhaps the correct path is to continue moving north from the shower. However, the user might have already tried that and is stuck. If moving north again doesn't help, maybe they need to try a different direction, like east or south, to avoid the loop.

Wait, the user's last action was "look", which didn't change the location. So, the next step should be to move in a direction that leads towards the cookhouse. Since the cookhouse is mentioned in the initial instructions, maybe the user needs to go north from the shower to reach the next room closer to the cookhouse. Alternatively, if moving north isn't working, maybe going east or south could be the way to go. But based on the initial steps, the user should continue moving north. However, the user is in the shower, and the next step might be to go north again. But the user might be in a loop, so perhaps using a synonym like "go north" again is necessary. Alternatively, maybe "move north" is the correct command. But the user's previous action was "look", so the next action should be to move north again. However, the user might need to check if there's a knife in the current room. But the initial instructions said to pick up the knife from the cookhouse, so maybe the user needs to reach the cookhouse first. Therefore, the next step is to go north from the shower to proceed towards the cookhouse.

You've entered a cookhouse. You begin looking for stuff.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

There is a knife on the floor.

Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is in a text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and pick up items. The goal seems to be to reach a certain location and collect the knife from the cookhouse.

Looking at the history, the user started in the pantry, went west to the parlor, then north to the shower, and now they're in the cookhouse. The current room is the cookhouse, and there's a knife on the floor. The previous actions were moving north from the shower, which led them here.

The user's task is to pick up the knife. The last command was "go north", which brought them to the cookhouse. Now, in the cookhouse, they need to pick up the knife. The next logical step would be to pick up the knife from the floor. But the game might require using the correct command, like "take knife" or "pick up knife". However, in some text games, the command is just "get knife" or "take knife". Since the user has been using "go" commands so far, maybe the correct action here is to pick up the knife.

Wait, the user's previous action was "go north", which led them to the cookhouse. Now, they need to pick up the knife. The game's description says there's a knife on the floor. So the next step is to take the knife. The correct command would be "take knife" or "get knife". But the user might need to use the exact phrase. Let me check the previous interactions. The user was told to "pick-up the knife from the floor of the cookhouse." So the correct action is to pick it up. The command should be "pick up knife" or "take knife". However, in the game's context, maybe the correct command is "get knife" or "take knife". Since the user has been using "go" commands, maybe "take knife" is the right action here. But I need to make sure. The previous steps were moving around, and now the goal is to pick up the knife. So the next action is to take the knife.
