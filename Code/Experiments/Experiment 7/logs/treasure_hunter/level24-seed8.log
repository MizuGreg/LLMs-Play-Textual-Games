Welcome to another profound session of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First step, make an attempt to go east. Then, attempt to venture east. And then, go east. Then, make an effort to travel south. Then, go to the west. With that accomplished, travel west. And then, head west. Following that, attempt to take a trip south. And then, pick up the spork from the floor of the cookery. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to win this game. The user's goal is to pick up the spork from the cookhouse. Let me recap the steps mentioned in the initial instructions.

First, they needed to go east three times, then south, west, and so on. But looking at the current position, the user is stuck in a loop between the Laundry Place and Playroom. Every time they go east, they end up in the Playroom, and going west brings them back to the Laundry Place. That's a loop.

The previous actions were repeatedly going east and west, which isn't making progress. The key is to break this loop. Maybe instead of "go east" or "go west," they should try using synonyms like "move east" or "head west." But the system might be expecting a specific command. Alternatively, maybe there's another exit or object to interact with.

Wait, in the Cookhouse, there's a mention of a spork. The user needs to get to the Cookhouse. But the current path is looping between Laundry and Playroom. Maybe they need to find another way to get to the Cookhouse. Let me check the previous steps again.

Earlier, the user was in the Cookhouse, then went west to Playroom, then back to Laundry. So maybe the correct path is to go from Playroom south to the Cookhouse again. But in the Playroom, there's an open gate leading south. So perhaps the user should go south from the Playroom to reach the Cookhouse again, then pick up the spork.

But the user has been stuck in the loop of east and west. The next step should be to go south from the Playroom to the Cookhouse, then check for the spork. However, in the current state, the user is in the Playroom again. So the next action should be to go south, not east or west. That's the key to break the loop and proceed to the Cookhouse.

-= Cubicle =-
You are in a cubicle. A normal kind of place.

You can make out a coffer. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. What's that over there? It looks like it's a desk. The desk is normal. However, the desk, like an empty desk, has nothing on it.

There is an open gate leading north. There is an open portal leading west. There is an unguarded exit to the east. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

-= Study =-
You're now in the study.

You make out a closed toolbox in the corner. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a locker. You see a mantle. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's an armchair. The armchair is normal. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open portal leading east. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

-= Cookery =-
You find yourself in a cookery. A typical kind of place.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked.

There is a spork on the floor.
