Welcome to another fast paced round of TextWorld! Here is how to play! Your first objective is to take a trip south. With that done, take a trip east. Once you get around to doing that, pick up the loaf of bread from the floor of the garage. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Study =-
You find yourself in a study. A typical kind of place. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.
