You are now playing a exciting episode of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First off, make an attempt to venture east. If you can succeed at that, attempt to take a trip east. And then, recover the keycard from the floor of the workshop. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Cubicle =-
You are in a cubicle. An usual kind of place.



There is an open wooden passageway leading east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Laundromat =-
You've just walked into a laundromat.



There is an open wooden gateway leading east. There is an open wooden passageway leading west.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is playing a text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and find a keycard to win. The current scenario is in a laundromat, with exits east and west.

First, the goal is to venture east, then take a trip east, recover the keycard from the workshop floor, and win. So far, the user has gone east from the cubicle to the laundromat. The next step should be to continue east from the laundromat. But the laundromat's east exit is a gateway, so maybe moving east again would lead to the next area. However, the user might be in a loop if they keep going east and west. But since the previous action was going east, the next logical step is to go east again. Wait, but the laundromat's east is a gateway, so maybe that's the next step. The keycard is in the workshop, so after moving east, they might reach the workshop. But the user needs to check the floor there. So the next action is to go east again.

-= Workshop =-
You are in a workshop. A standard kind of place. The room is well lit.



There is an open stone gate leading east. There is an open wooden gateway leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked.

There is a keycard on the floor.


>                                                                                                                                -= Workshop =-0/3

Okay, let's break this down. The user is playing a text-based game where the goal is to recover the keycard from the workshop and then win. Let me recall the steps.

First, the initial location was a cubicle, then they went east to a laundromat, and then east again to the workshop. Now, in the workshop, there's a keycard on the floor. The goal is to take the keycard and then proceed to the next step, which I assume is exiting or reaching the exit.

So, the current step is to pick up the keycard. The user has already moved east twice, so the next logical step is to pick up the keycard. The previous actions were moving east, but now the keycard is here. The user needs to take the keycard. The command should be "take keycard" or "pick up keycard". Since the keycard is on the floor, the correct action is to take it. Then, after taking it, the game should be won. So the next action is to take the keycard.
