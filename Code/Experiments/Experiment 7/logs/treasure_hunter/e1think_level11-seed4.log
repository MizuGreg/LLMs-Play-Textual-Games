Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First off, make an attempt to move south. And then, pick up the napkin from the floor of the scullery. That's it!

-= Canteen =-
You are in a canteen. A standard kind of place.



There is an open portal leading north. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

>                                                                                                                                -= Canteen =-0/1

go south
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Scullery =-
You arrive in a scullery. A standard one.

You make out a closed refrigerator here.

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

There is a napkin on the floor.


>                                                                                                                                -= Scullery =-0/2
THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in the Scullery, which is part of the game. The goal is to pick up the napkin from the floor. The user has already moved south from the Canteen to the Scullery. Now, in the Scullery, there's a napkin on the floor. The next step is to pick up the napkin. But the current description mentions a closed refrigerator and an exit to the north. The user needs to pick up the napkin, so the action should be to take the napkin. The previous action was moving south, which was correct. Now, the next action is to pick up the napkin. Since the user is in the Scullery and the napkin is on the floor, the command should be "take napkin" or "pick up napkin". The user needs to make sure they don't repeat actions that didn't work. Since moving south was the first step, now the second step is picking up the napkin. The answer should be the command to pick up the napkin.
