Welcome to TextWorld! Here is how to play! First of all, look and see that the portal is ajar. And then, make an effort to head south. With that accomplished, ensure that the passageway is open. After that, make an effort to move east. Then, lift the nest of earwigs from the floor of the attic. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Recreation Zone =-
You find yourself in a recreation zone. A standard kind of place. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You make out a suitcase. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a locked locker close by. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a shelf. But the thing is empty.

There is a closed portal leading south. There is an open gateway leading west. There is an unguarded exit to the east.

-= Cubicle =-
You are in a cubicle. A standard one. The room is well lit.

You can see a safe. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You can make out a table. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is a closed passageway leading east. There is an open portal leading north. There is an open hatch leading west. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

You've just sauntered into an office.

You see an opened display. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this?

You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

-= Attic =-
You've stumbled into an usual room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be usual. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the attic.

You make out a workbench. The workbench is typical. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is a closed passageway leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

There is a nest of earwigs on the floor.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in the Attic room. The goal is to lift the nest of earwigs to win. But the system isn't recognizing "lift the nest of earwigs" as a valid command.

First, I need to recall the game's objective. The original instructions said to lift the nest of earwigs from the floor of the attic. So the correct action should be to lift it. But the system is rejecting it. Maybe the verb is different? Like "pick up" instead of "lift"? Or maybe the object needs to be specified differently.

Looking at the previous attempts, the user tried "lift the nest of earwigs" multiple times, but it's not working. The system might be expecting a different phrasing. Maybe "pick up" is the correct verb here. Alternatively, perhaps the command should be "take the nest of earwigs" or "get the nest of earwigs".

Also, checking the current room description: the nest is on the floor. So the action is to lift it from the floor. Maybe the correct command is "lift the nest" without specifying "of earwigs", but that might not be right. Or maybe "pick up the nest of earwigs".

Alternatively, maybe the system is case-sensitive. The user tried "lift the nest of earwigs" but maybe it should be "Lift the nest of earwigs" with a capital letter. But the system's response was that it's not a recognized verb, so maybe the verb is different.

Another possibility is that the game expects the player to use the verb "take" instead of "lift". So the correct command might be "take the nest of earwigs".

Since the user is in the Attic room, and the nest is present, the next step is to use the correct verb. The previous attempts with "lift" didn't work, so trying "take" might be the solution. Therefore, the next action should be "take the nest of earwigs".
