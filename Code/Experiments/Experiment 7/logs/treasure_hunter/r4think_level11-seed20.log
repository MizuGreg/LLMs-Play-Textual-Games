You are now playing a profound episode of TextWorld! First, it would be a great idea if you could travel north. Then, pick-up the loaf of bread from the floor of the launderette. Alright, thanks!

-= Basement =-
Welcome to the basement. Let's see what's in here.



There is an open passageway leading east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Launderette =-
You find yourself in a launderette. An usual one.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

There is a loaf of bread on the floor.
