Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First thing I need you to do is to head west. After that, recover the chocolate bar from the floor of the workshop. Alright, thanks!

-= Kitchenette =-
You've just walked into a kitchenette.

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a cabinet. You can make out a saucepan. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

-= Workshop =-
You are in a workshop. A standard kind of place. You begin looking for stuff.



There is an unguarded exit to the east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

There is a chocolate bar and a broccoli on the floor.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text-based game where they need to recover a chocolate bar from the workshop. The initial steps were to go west, which led them to the workshop. Now, in the workshop, they see a chocolate bar on the floor.

First, the goal is to recover the chocolate bar. The user has already moved west, which was the first step. Now, they need to pick up the chocolate bar. The next logical step is to take the chocolate bar. But the prompt says to check if there's a loop. Since the user just entered the workshop and found the chocolate bar, there's no loop here. The previous action was moving west, and now the next action should be picking up the chocolate. So the correct command is "take chocolate bar".
</think>take chocolate bar
