THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in a text-based game. The goal is to move north, then north again, then east, south, pick up the passkey, and win. But they seem to be stuck in a loop between the Shower and Laundromat rooms.

First, I need to recap the game's objective. The user has to move north, then north again, then east, south, pick up the passkey, and win. So far, the user has gone north from Studio to Laundromat, then north again to Shower, then south back to Laundromat, then north again to Shower. They're stuck here, repeating the same steps.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Shower room again. The previous actions didn't help because they kept looping. The next step should be to try a different direction instead of just going north or south. The user needs to find the passkey, which is in the cellar, but they might not have explored that properly.

Wait, the user was in the Cellar earlier. They went west from the Cellar back to the Shower. Maybe they need to check the Cellar again for the passkey. But the passkey is in the chamber, which is the Studio? Or maybe the Cellar has the passkey. The initial instruction says to pick up the passkey from the floor of the chamber. The chamber is the Studio, but the user is in the Shower now. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the passkey is in the Cellar. The user needs to go west from the Cellar to the Shower, but then they can't get back. Wait, the Cellar has an exit to the south. So maybe the user should go south from the Cellar to the Laundromat, then north to the Shower again, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe the passkey is in the Laundromat. The user needs to check the Laundromat for the passkey. But the Laundromat has a towel on the floor. Wait, the initial instruction says to pick up the passkey from the floor of the chamber. The chamber is the Studio, but the user is in the Shower now. Maybe the passkey is in the Cellar. The user needs to go west from the Cellar to the Shower, but that's where they are now. Maybe they need to check the Cellar again for the passkey. But the Cellar's description doesn't mention a passkey. The Shower room has the passkey? Or maybe the user needs to go east from the Shower to the Cellar again. Wait, the user is in the Shower, and the directions say to try east or south. If they go east, they might reach the Cellar again. But the user was in the Cellar before and went west back to the Shower. So maybe the passkey is in the Cellar. The user needs to check there. But how? The user hasn't picked it up yet. So the next step is to go east from the Shower to the Cellar again, then check for the passkey. But the user is stuck in a loop between Shower and Laundromat. So the key is to break the loop by trying a different direction. The user should try going east from the Shower to the Cellar, then check for the passkey there. But the previous action was going south from the Shower to Laundromat. So the next action should be to go east instead of south. That would take them to the Cellar again. Then, maybe they can find the passkey there. So the next command should be "go east".

Okay, let's break this down. The user is stuck in a loop between the Shower and Cellar rooms. The goal is to move north, then north again, east, south, pick up the passkey, and win. But the user has been going back and forth between Shower and Cellar.

First, the goal steps are: go north (Studio → Laundromat), then north again (Laundromat → Shower), then east (Shower → Cellar), south (Cellar → Laundromat), pick up passkey, win. But the user is stuck in the Shower/Cellar loop.

Second, past actions: They went north, north, south, north, east, west, east, west, east, west. So they've tried moving in those directions but haven't found the passkey. The passkey is supposed to be in the chamber (Studio?), but they're not there anymore.

Third, the loop is between Shower and Cellar. The user is repeatedly going east and west between them. To break the loop, they need to try a different direction. The passkey might be in the Cellar, but the user hasn't checked there yet. Alternatively, maybe the passkey is in the Laundromat or Shower. But the user needs to find it.

The next step is to check the Cellar for the passkey. Since the user is in the Cellar, they should look around. But the previous actions didn't find it. Maybe the passkey is in the Cellar, and the user needs to pick it up. So the next action should be to pick up the passkey from the floor. But the game might require them to be in the correct room. Alternatively, maybe the passkey is in the Studio, but the user has to go back there.

Wait, the initial instruction says to pick up the passkey from the floor of the chamber. The chamber is the Studio. But the user is in the Cellar now. So maybe they need to go back to the Studio. But how? The user has to go south from the Cellar to Laundromat, then south again to Studio? Wait, the initial move was north from Studio to Laundromat. So to get back, they need to go south from Laundromat to Studio. But the user is in the Cellar, so they need to go south to Laundromat, then south again to Studio. But that's not the current step. The user is in the Cellar, so the next step is to go south to Laundromat, then south to Studio to pick up the passkey. But the user is stuck in the loop, so they need to break it by trying a different action. The passkey is in the Studio, so the user needs to get back there. Therefore, the next action should be to go south from the Cellar to Laundromat, then south again to Studio. But the user is in the Cellar, so the next command is "go south".
