Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to ensure that the portal is open. After that, go to the north. After that, go to the west. And then, make an effort to head north. And then, travel east. After that, retrieve the butterfly from the box within the workshop. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Laundromat =-
You've entered a laundromat.

You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a rack. The rack is typical. But the thing is empty.

There is a closed portal leading north. There is an open gate leading south.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user wants me to figure out the next step in the game. The goal is to open the portal, then go north, west, north, east, retrieve the butterfly from the workshop. So far, the player has opened the portal, gone north to the cellar, west to the office, north to the chamber. Now, the next step according to the instructions is to go east from the chamber. But the current location is the Chamber, which has an exit to the east. So the next action should be to go east. Wait, but the user's last action was going north to the Chamber. The Chamber's description says there's an exit to the east. So the next step is to go east. But the user might be in a loop if they keep going back. But according to the steps, after the Chamber, the next step is to go east. Then, after that, they need to go to the workshop to get the butterfly. So the next command is go east.

-= Workshop =-
You've just shown up in a workshop.

You can see a box. The box contains a butterfly. You make out a locker. You can see a portmanteau.

You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.
