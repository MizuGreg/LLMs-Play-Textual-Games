You are now playing a exciting game of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First, it would be great if you could go west. After that, attempt to head north. And then, lift the banana from the floor of the workshop. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Canteen =-
You find yourself in a canteen. A normal kind of place. You start to take note of what's in the room.



There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

-= Kitchenette =-
Fancy seeing you here. Here, by the way, being the kitchenette.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. There is an unguarded exit to the north.

There is a bowl on the floor.

-= Workshop =-
You find yourself in a workshop. A typical kind of place.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

There is a banana on the floor.

That's not a verb I recognise.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to win the game by following specific steps. The goal is to go west, then north, then lift the banana. But in the current scenario, they're in the Workshop, and the banana is on the floor. The user tried "lift banana" but got an error.

First, I need to recall the game's requirements. The correct sequence is: go west (from Canteen to Kitchenette), then go north (from Kitchenette to Workshop), then lift the banana in the Workshop. But the user already did the first two steps. Now they're in the Workshop, and the banana is there. The error suggests that "lift banana" isn't a valid command. Maybe the correct verb is "take" instead of "lift"? Or perhaps the item needs to be picked up using a different term.

Wait, in some text adventures, "take" is the standard command for picking up items. The user might have used "lift" which isn't recognized. So the next step should be to "take banana" instead. Let me check the previous steps again. The user went west, then north, arriving at the Workshop with the banana on the floor. The correct action here is to take the banana. The error message indicates that "lift" isn't valid, so switching to "take" should work. That would complete the task and win the game.
