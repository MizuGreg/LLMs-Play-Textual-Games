Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! First of all, go to the north. With that done, make an attempt to take a trip east. With that done, pick up the latchkey from the pan. That's it!

-= Bathroom =-
You find yourself in a bathroom. A standard kind of place.

Were you looking for a board? Because look over there, it's a board. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is an open gateway leading north. There is an open gate leading south.

-= Cubicle =-
I am sorry to announce that you are now in the cubicle.

You see a coffer. You make out an opened trunk. The trunk is empty! What a waste of a day!

There is an open gateway leading south. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east.

-= Cookhouse =-
Wow! You're in a cookhouse. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You make out a pan. The pan is ordinary. On the pan you see a latchkey. You scan the room, seeing a bowl. However, the bowl, like an empty bowl, has nothing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the bowl.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.
