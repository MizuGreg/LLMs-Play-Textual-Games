You are now playing a life changing game of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to move south. With that over with, pick-up the latchkey from the floor of the closet. Got that? Good!

-= Office =-
You've just sauntered into an office.



There is an open walnut gate leading east. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

go south

-= Closet =-
You find yourself in a closet. An ordinary one. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You see a stand. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north.

There is a latchkey on the floor.

That's not a verb I recognise.
