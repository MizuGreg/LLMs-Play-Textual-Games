It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First of all, make an effort to head north. With that accomplished, head east. Then, make absolutely sure that the passageway in the cubicle is opened. After that, try to take a trip east. After that, retrieve the nest of earwigs from the floor of the attic. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is stuck in a loop between the Cookhouse and Study. The goal is to eventually get to the attic to retrieve the earwigs. The instructions said to go north from the cookhouse, then east to the study, open the passageway, then go east again, and finally get the earwigs.

But the user keeps going back and forth between the two rooms. Each time they go north, they end up in the study, then south back to the cookhouse. That's a loop. So the problem is that the previous actions aren't making progress. The user needs to find a different action instead of just repeating "go north" and "go south".

Wait, in the study, there's an open hatch leading east. Maybe the user should try going east from the study instead of south. But the prompt says to go south from the study. But that's leading back to the cookhouse. Maybe the hatch east in the study is the way forward. But the user hasn't tried that yet. Let me check the previous steps.

The user's actions so far have been going north and south repeatedly. The next step should be to try going east from the study. But the initial instructions said to go east after reaching the study. Wait, the original plan was: go north, then east, then open the passageway, then east again, then get the earwigs. But maybe the user hasn't opened the passageway yet. However, the user hasn't tried any actions besides moving between the rooms. So perhaps the key is to find the correct path, maybe using the hatch east in the study. Alternatively, maybe there's a different command needed, like "open hatch" or something else. But the user hasn't tried that yet. Since the user is stuck in a loop, the next action should be to go east from the study, which is the hatch. That would break the loop and move forward.

First step: The goal is to go north from the cookhouse, then east to the study, open the passageway, go east again, and retrieve the earwigs. But the user hasn't opened the passageway yet.

Second step: The user has tried going north and south multiple times, which is just looping. They haven't tried any other actions like opening the hatch or looking for items.

Third step: The loop is because the user is stuck moving between the same rooms. The key is to find a different action. Instead of going north or south, maybe they need to interact with the hatch in the study. The previous attempts to go east didn't work, but maybe the correct action is to open the hatch instead of moving.

Finally, the next action should be to open the hatch leading east in the study. That's the step needed to break the loop and proceed further.

Okay, let's try to figure out what's going on here. The user is stuck in the Cookhouse, repeatedly trying to move north and south, which just loops them between the Cookhouse and Study. The goal is to eventually get to the attic, open a passageway, and retrieve the earwigs.

First, the goal steps are: go north from Cookhouse, then east to Study, open the passageway, go east again, then get the earwigs. But the user hasn't opened the passageway yet. They've been moving between rooms without interacting with any objects.

Second, the user's past actions have been moving north and south, which doesn't help. They haven't looked for items or tried to open anything. The Study has an open hatch east, but the user hasn't tried going east from there. Earlier attempts to go east from Cookhouse failed, but maybe they should try going east from the Study instead.

Third, the user is in a loop because they're not interacting with the environment. They need to break the loop by trying a different action, like opening the hatch in the Study. Since previous actions like "look east" didn't work, maybe the correct command is to "open hatch" again, even though it was tried before. Alternatively, maybe the passageway is already open, and the user needs to proceed east from the Study.

The next step should be to go east from the Study, which is the hatch. But the user is in the Cookhouse, so they need to go north to the Study first. Wait, the user is in the Cookhouse again, so they need to go north to the Study, then east. But the user is stuck in a loop, so maybe the correct action is to go east from the Study once they're there. But how to get there without looping? Maybe the user needs to try a different command, like "open hatch" again, even though it was tried before. Alternatively, maybe the passageway is already open, and the user just needs to proceed east.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is stuck in the Cookhouse, repeatedly looking in all directions but not finding anything. The goal is to reach the attic, open a passageway, and get the earwigs. So far, the user has been moving between the Cookhouse and Study, but hasn't found the passageway or the earwigs.

First step: The goal is to go north from the Cookhouse, then east to the Study, open the passageway, go east again, and retrieve the earwigs. But the user hasn't opened the passageway yet.

Second step: The user has tried looking in all directions but hasn't found anything. They need to find the passageway or the earwigs. Maybe they need to interact with the Study's hatch or look for something else.

Third step: The user is in a loop, moving between rooms without progress. The previous actions of looking around didn't help. The next step should be to try a different action, like using a synonym for "open" or trying to interact with the Study's hatch again. Since "open hatch" didn't work, maybe "open passage" or "open door" could be tried. Alternatively, maybe the passageway is already open, and the user needs to go east from the Study.

You can see a safe. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You can make out a table. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is a closed passageway leading east. There is a closed portal leading north. There is an open hatch leading west. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

You've stumbled into an usual room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be usual. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the attic.

You make out a workbench. The workbench is typical. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is an open passageway leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

There is a nest of earwigs on the floor.
