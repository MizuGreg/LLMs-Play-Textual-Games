Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an fast paced round of TextWorld? You do! First step, head east. Okay, and then, go north. Once you accomplish that, take a trip east. Once you finish that, try to go south. Once you accomplish that, head south. After that, make an effort to travel south. With that done, recover the mop from the floor of the laundry place. Got that? Good!

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and eventually recover a mop from the laundry place. The current room is the Bedroom, and they've been moving between rooms like Cookery, Cubicle, and Bedroom repeatedly.

First, the goal is to recover the mop from the laundry place. The user's previous actions have been moving east, north, south, west, etc., but they seem to be stuck in a loop between the Bedroom and Cookery. Each time they go east from the Bedroom, they end up in the Cookery, then going west brings them back to the Bedroom. Similarly, going north from Cookery takes them to the Cubicle, and south brings them back. This loop isn't helping them progress towards the mop.

The next step should be to find a way out of this loop. Since the user is in the Bedroom, they need to find a path that leads them towards the laundry place. The initial instructions mentioned going east, north, then south, etc., but that didn't work. Maybe they need to explore other paths or look for items. The chest in the Bedroom might be a clue. But the user hasn't checked it yet.

Wait, the user's previous actions have been moving between rooms without interacting with objects. The key might be to check the chest in the Bedroom. If they open the chest, maybe they find a key or something that helps them proceed. Alternatively, the portal west from the Bedroom might lead to another area. But the user has been going east and north, which loops them back.

So, the next action should be to check the chest in the Bedroom. If they can't open it, maybe they need to find another way. But since the user is stuck in a loop, the solution is to break the cycle by interacting with the chest instead of moving around. The command should be to open the chest.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Bedroom and Cookery, repeatedly moving east and west. The goal is to recover the mop from the laundry place. The user has been trying to take the mop from the chest but can't see it. The chest is in the Bedroom, but there's no mop there. So the problem is that the user is stuck in a cycle without progressing towards the mop.

First, the goal is to get to the laundry place and find the mop. The user has been moving between rooms without finding the mop. The next step should be to find another way out of the loop. Maybe the portal west from the Bedroom leads to the laundry place. But the user has been going east and north, which loops them back. So instead of moving east, they should try going west from the Bedroom. That's a different action than before, breaking the loop. The command would be "go west".

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to recover the mop from the laundry place. They've been stuck in a loop between the Bedroom and Laundromat, moving east and west. The goal is to find the mop in the Laundromat.

First, the goal is to get to the laundry place and take the mop. The user has already reached the Laundromat but can't see the mop. They tried taking it from the floor but couldn't. The problem is that the mop isn't visible, so maybe it's hidden or in a container.

Second, the past actions include moving between rooms and checking the chest in the Bedroom, which didn't have the mop. Now in the Laundromat, they need to look closer. The command "look" was used multiple times, but it didn't find the mop. Maybe the mop is in a different location, like under the table or in a container.

Third, the user is in a loop of checking the same areas. To break the loop, they need to check other possibilities. Since the mop isn't visible, maybe they need to examine the table or check the portals. The open portal east might lead to another area with the mop. Alternatively, the gate south could be a different path. The correct action is to go east through the portal instead of repeating "take the mop from the floor".

Okay, let's break this down. The user is stuck in a loop between the Bedroom, Cookery, and Cubicle. The goal is to recover the mop from the laundry place. The user has been moving east and west repeatedly without making progress.

First, the goal is to reach the laundry place and find the mop. The user has been going back and forth between rooms without finding the mop. The chest in the Bedroom is empty, so that's not helpful.

Second, the past actions involve moving between rooms without interacting with objects. The user tried taking the mop from the floor but couldn't see it. Now, they're back in the loop, so they need a different approach.

Third, the loop is between the same rooms. To break it, the user needs to find another way. The Laundromat was previously visited, but the mop wasn't there. Maybe the mop is in a different location, like under the table or in a container. Alternatively, the user might need to check the portals or gates again. Since the previous attempts to take the mop failed, the next step is to check the table again or look for other items.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Laundromat and other rooms, repeatedly trying to take the mop from the floor but can't see it. The goal is to recover the mop. The previous attempts to take the mop failed because it's not visible. The user needs to find another way. Maybe the mop is in a container or hidden. Since the table is empty, maybe check the portals or gates. The open gate leading south might lead to another area with the mop. So, the next step is to go south through the gate.

Ah, the cellar. This is some kind of cellar, really great ordinary vibes in this place, a wonderful ordinary atmosphere. The room is well lit.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

There is an open gate leading north. There is an open hatch leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Cellar =-
Ah, the cellar. This is some kind of cellar, really great ordinary vibes in this place, a wonderful ordinary atmosphere. The room is well lit.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

There is an open gate leading north. There is an open hatch leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Office, Shower, and Cellar. The goal is to recover the mop from the laundry place. They've been moving east and west without finding the mop. The previous attempts to take the mop from the floor in the Laundromat didn't work. Now, they're in the Shower again. The next step is to check the passageway east from the Shower, which might lead to the laundry place. Alternatively, the north exit from the Shower might lead to another area. Since the user is in a loop, they need to try a different direction.
