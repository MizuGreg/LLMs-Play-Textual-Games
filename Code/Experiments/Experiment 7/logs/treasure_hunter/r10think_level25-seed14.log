THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user needs to pick up the mop from the laundry place and then win. So far, they've gone through several rooms: kitchenette, shower, office, cellar, laundromat, bedroom, scullery, studio, cookery, and back to the bedroom. They opened the chest but couldn't find the mop. Maybe the mop is in the laundromat? Wait, the laundromat was mentioned as a place where the mop might be. But when they were in the laundromat, they went east to the bedroom. Maybe they need to check the laundromat again.

Wait, the user is currently in the bedroom. The previous steps included going to the laundromat, but maybe the mop is there. However, when they were in the laundromat, they didn't find the mop. The chest in the bedroom was opened, but the mop wasn't there. Maybe the mop is in the laundromat, but they didn't check the right place. Alternatively, maybe the mop is in the scullery or another room. But the user is stuck in the bedroom. They need to find another way to get to the laundromat again. Since the laundromat has an exit to the south and east, maybe they need to go back to the laundromat from the bedroom. Wait, the bedroom has an exit to the south, which leads to the scullery, then east to the studio, but maybe the laundromat is connected through another path. Alternatively, maybe the mop is in the laundromat, but the user didn't check the right spot. They need to go back to the laundromat and look again. So the next step is to go south from the bedroom to the scullery, then east to the studio, then north to the cookery, then west to the bedroom again? That seems like a loop. Alternatively, maybe the mop is in the laundromat, and the user needs to check the laundromat again. But how? They might have to go back through the same path. Wait, the laundromat has an exit to the west (bedroom) and east (studio). So maybe the user needs to go from the bedroom to the laundromat again, then check the laundromat's areas. But the user is in the bedroom now. So the next step is to go south to the scullery, then east to the studio, then north to the cookery, then west to the bedroom again. That's a loop. Alternatively, maybe the mop is in the laundromat, and the user needs to check the laundromat's south exit. Wait, the laundromat has a south exit. So maybe the user should go from the bedroom to the scullery, then south to the laundromat again. Wait, no, the laundromat is already visited. Maybe the user needs to check the laundromat's table again. But when they were there, they didn't find the mop. Maybe the mop is on the table, but they didn't look properly. Alternatively, maybe the mop is in the scullery. But the user is in the bedroom. So the next step is to go back to the laundromat via the west exit (bedroom) and then check again. But they are already in the bedroom. So the user needs to go south to the scullery, then east to the studio, then north to the cookery, then west to the bedroom again. That's a loop. Alternatively, maybe the user should go east from the bedroom to the studio, then north to the cookery, then west to the bedroom again. But that's not helpful. Wait, the user needs to find the mop in the laundromat. Maybe they need to go from the bedroom to the laundromat again. But how? The bedroom has a south exit to the scullery, then east to the studio, then north to the cookery, then west to the bedroom. That's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe the user should go from the bedroom to the north exit to the cookery, then west to the studio, then south to the laundromat. Wait, the cookery has a west exit to the studio. The studio has a south exit to the laundromat? No, the studio's exits are north and south. Wait, the studio's description says: "You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked." So from the studio, you can go north to the cookery, south to the laundromat, or west to the bedroom. So if the user is in the studio, they can go south to the laundromat. But the user is in the bedroom. So the path is: bedroom (current) -> south to scullery -> east to studio -> south to laundromat. Then check the laundromat again. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next step is to go south from the bedroom to the scullery, then east to the studio, then south to the laundromat. Then look for the mop. But the user is in the bedroom now. So the next action is to go south to the scullery.
