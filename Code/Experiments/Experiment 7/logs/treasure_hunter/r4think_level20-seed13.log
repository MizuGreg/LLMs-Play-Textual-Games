Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First off, go west. Okay, and then, move south. Then, move west. With that done, go north. Once you manage that, make an attempt to go north. That done, venture east. And then, head north. After that, go to the west. With that done, look and see that the trunk within the attic is wide open. After pulling open the trunk, pick up the keycard from the trunk. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Bar =-
You find yourself in a bar. A typical kind of place. You begin looking for stuff.



There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

-= Scullery =-
You arrive in a scullery. Let's see what's in here.

Look over there! a case. You look around you, at all the containers and supporters, doors and objects, and you think to yourself. Why? Why Textworld? You can see a fridge. The fridge is empty! What a waste of a day!

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

-= Attic =-
You've entered an attic.

You scan the room, seeing a trunk. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The user wants me to figure out the next step in the game. The goal is to reach the attic, open the trunk, pick up the keycard, and win. So far, the player has moved west, south, west, north, north, and now they're in the attic. The current room is the attic, where there's a trunk. The previous steps align with the instructions: after going north twice, they're here.

The next step according to the original instructions was to pull open the trunk and pick up the keycard. But in the attic description, the player sees a trunk and a scurrying sound. The exits are east and south. The user's last action was going north to the attic. Now, the next logical step is to interact with the trunk. The problem might be that the trunk isn't automatically open, so the player needs to open it. The command should be to open the trunk. But the game might require a specific verb, like 'open' or 'pull'. Since the user is told to "pull open the trunk", the correct action is to pull it. So the next command is 'pull open the trunk'.
