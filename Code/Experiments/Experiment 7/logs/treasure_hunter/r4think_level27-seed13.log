I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First step, go north. Following that, make sure that the fresh laundry scented door in the kitchenette is unlocked. After you have unlocked the fresh laundry scented door, ensure that the fresh laundry scented door is open. And then, attempt to take a trip north. After that, make an effort to go to the north. After that, head west. Next, make an effort to venture west. Following that, make an attempt to go to the west. With that over with, go to the west. And then, travel south. Then, go east. Once you finish that, move south. If you can get through with that, make an effort to venture south. If you can do that, recover the key from the floor of the bar. Alright, thanks!

-= Laundromat =-
You find yourself in a laundromat. An usual kind of place.

You make out a locked safe. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a board. The board is typical. But there isn't a thing on it. You think about smashing the board to bits, throwing the bits in a fire, etc, until you get bored.

There is an open gate leading north. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is in a text-based game set in a laundromat. Their task involves moving through different rooms and interacting with objects. The current location is the Kitchenette, and they've just unlocked and opened the fresh laundry scented door.

First, I need to recall the original goal. The user's task was to go north, unlock the door, open it, then take a trip north again, go west, south, east, and finally recover a key from the bar. But the current step is after opening the door. The next step mentioned was to attempt to take a trip north again. However, the user might be stuck in a loop if they keep going north without progress.

Looking at the previous steps: they went north from the laundromat to the kitchenette, unlocked and opened the door. Now, the next action should be to go north through that door. But if that leads back to the laundromat or another room without progress, they might be looping. However, the user's next step was to go north again, so maybe that's the correct action. Alternatively, if the door leads to a new room, they need to check if they can proceed. Since the user hasn't mentioned any issues yet, the next logical step is to go north again through the opened door. But the user's instruction says to check if they're in a loop. If the previous actions didn't make progress, they need to try a different action. However, in this case, the user has just opened the door, so the next step is to go north through it. The answer should be "go north" again.

You've entered a bedroom. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.



There is an open fresh laundry scented door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

You scan the room for a dresser, and you find a dresser. You look at the price tag that the dresser's owner still hasn't taken off. Three hundred big ones?! Where'd they buy this dresser, some kind of expensive store? Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a bench. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You see a rack. The rack is standard. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unblocked exit to the south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text adventure game, and their goal is to follow a series of movements and interactions. The current location is the Bedroom again after going east from the Salon. The user has been moving between rooms, but seems to be looping between Bedroom and Salon.

First, the goal is to go north, unlock the door, open it, then go north again, west, south, east, and finally get the key from the bar. But so far, the user has gone north from the laundromat, unlocked and opened the door in the kitchenette, then went north to the bedroom, then east to the salon, then back to the bedroom. They're stuck in a loop between Bedroom and Salon.

The next step should be to break the loop. Since going east from Salon leads back to Bedroom, maybe trying a different direction, like north or west. The user tried going north from Salon but was redirected to Bedroom. The Salon has an unguarded exit to the west. Maybe going west from Salon would lead to a new room where the key is located. The key is in the bar, so perhaps the user needs to find the bar room. Alternatively, the key might be in the washroom or another room. But the user's previous actions haven't reached the bar yet. The correct next step is to go west from Salon to escape the loop and proceed towards the bar.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a loop between the Salon and Washroom. The goal is to recover the key from the bar. So far, they've gone through several rooms but haven't found the bar yet. The key is in the bar, so they need to get there. The previous actions led them back to the Salon, so maybe they need to try a different direction. The Salon has an exit to the east which is unblocked. Maybe going east from the Salon will lead them to the bar. Alternatively, the Washroom has an exit to the east, but that leads back to the Salon. Wait, the user is in the Salon again. The Salon's exits are east, north, and west. They tried north and south, which looped. So the next step should be to go east from the Salon to find the bar. That's the logical move to break the loop and proceed towards the key.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Salon, Washroom, and Bedroom. The goal is to recover the key from the bar. So far, they've tried multiple directions but haven't found the bar yet. The key is in the bar, so they need to get there. The previous actions led them back to the same rooms, so maybe they need to try a different approach. The Salon has an exit to the east which is unblocked. Maybe going east from the Salon will lead them to the bar. That's the logical move to break the loop and proceed towards the key.

You see a rack. The rack is standard. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unblocked exit to the south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

You arrive in a washroom. An usual one.

You scan the room for a dresser, and you find a dresser. You look at the price tag that the dresser's owner still hasn't taken off. Three hundred big ones?! Where'd they buy this dresser, some kind of expensive store? Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a bench. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You see a rack. The rack is standard. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unblocked exit to the south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

-= Washroom =-
You arrive in a washroom. An usual one.

You scan the room for a dresser, and you find a dresser. You look at the price tag that the dresser's owner still hasn't taken off. Three hundred big ones?! Where'd they buy this dresser, some kind of expensive store? Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a bench. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You see a rack. The rack is standard. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unblocked exit to the south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

You are in a salon.

You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a basket. You see a mantelpiece. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens!

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

-= Salon =-
You are in a salon.

You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a basket. You see a mantelpiece. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens!

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an unguarded exit to the west.
