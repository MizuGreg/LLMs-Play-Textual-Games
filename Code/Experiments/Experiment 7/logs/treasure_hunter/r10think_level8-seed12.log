It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, make an attempt to go to the south. After that, attempt to go east. That done, go south. With that accomplished, lift the bug from the floor of the closet. Alright, thanks!

-= Workshop =-
You are in a workshop. An ordinary one. You can barely contain your excitement.



There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Cookhouse =-
You find yourself in a cookhouse. A standard kind of place. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the north.

-= Vault =-
You find yourself in a vault. A normal one.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the south. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

-= Closet =-
You've entered a closet. Let's see what's in here.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a durian and a bug on the floor.
