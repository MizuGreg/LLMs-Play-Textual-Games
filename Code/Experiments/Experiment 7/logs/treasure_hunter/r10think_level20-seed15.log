THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Laundromat and Canteen. The original instructions said to go west, then east, repeating. The goal was to open the gateway, go north, then west, south, etc., to get the apple.

But the user keeps alternating between going west and east, which is causing them to loop. The problem is that the game environment is flipping between the two locations each time they move. So, the key is to find a way to break this loop. 

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Laundromat again, seeing a locked basket. The previous steps involved moving west and east repeatedly. The next step should be to try opening the gateway north, as per the initial plan. But the gateway is closed, so maybe there's a way to open it. However, the user hasn't tried interacting with the gateway yet. 

Wait, the initial instructions mentioned pulling open the gateway. So maybe the correct action is to try opening the gateway north. But the user has been moving west and east instead. So the next step should be to attempt to open the closed gateway leading north. That would be the next logical step after moving west, as per the original plan. 

But the user is stuck in a loop because they keep moving west and east. So the assistant needs to suggest a different action, not repeating the same movement. The next action should be to try opening the gateway, not moving again. That would break the loop and progress towards the goal.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is stuck in a loop between the Laundromat and Canteen, repeatedly moving west and east. The goal is to open the gateway, go north, then west, south, etc., to retrieve the apple.

First, the goal steps are: venture west, open the gateway, go north, move north again, then west, south, open the safe, get the apple. But the user has been moving west and east instead of addressing the gateway.

Second, the past actions have been moving west and east, which isn't progressing towards opening the gateway. The next step should be to open the gateway, but the user keeps trying to move instead of interacting with the gateway.

Third, the loop is caused by continuous movement without interacting with the gateway. The correct action is to open the gateway, not move again. So the next command should be to open the gateway north.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's tackle this. The user is stuck in a loop between two rooms, moving west and east repeatedly. The goal is to open a gateway, go north, then follow specific movements to get the apple.

First, the goal steps are: venture west, open the gateway, go north, move north again, then west, south, open the safe, retrieve the apple. But the user has been moving west and east instead of opening the gateway.

Second, the past actions have been moving west and east, which isn't progressing. The next step should be to open the gateway, but the user keeps trying to move. So, the loop is because they're not interacting with the gateway.

Third, the loop is caused by continuous movement without interacting. The correct action is to open the gateway, not move again. So the next command should be to open the gateway north.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Laundromat and Canteen, moving west and east repeatedly. The goal is to open the gateway, go north, then follow specific movements to get the apple.

First, the goal steps are: venture west, open the gateway, go north, move north again, then west, south, open the safe, retrieve the apple. But the user has been moving west and east instead of opening the gateway.

Second, the past actions have been moving west and east, which isn't progressing. The next step should be to open the gateway, but the user keeps trying to move. So, the loop is because they're not interacting with the gateway.

Third, the loop is caused by continuous movement without interacting. The correct action is to open the gateway, not move again. So the next command should be to open the gateway north.
