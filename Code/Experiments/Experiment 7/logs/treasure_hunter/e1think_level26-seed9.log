Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! First stop, head south. Then, try to head west. Then, make an effort to move south. Following that, venture west. With that over with, move west. If you can get around to doing that, head north. Okay, and then, make an effort to move east. And then, travel north. After that, head north. Once you do that, try to take a trip west. That done, go to the west. With that over with, recover the paper towel from the safe. Alright, thanks!

You arrive in a launderette. A normal one.



There is an unguarded exit to the north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a TextWorld game, and their goal is to navigate through different locations, pick up items, and eventually reach the end. The current location is a bathroom with a trunk and a dresser. The previous steps involved moving south from the launderette, then into the bathroom.

The user's instructions mention moving in specific directions: south, west, north, east, etc. But in the bathroom, the exits are north and west. The user needs to find a way forward without getting stuck in a loop. 

Looking at the current location, the user is in the bathroom. The previous action was going south from the launderette, which led to the bathroom. Now, the possible exits are north (back to the launderette) and west. The user's next step should be to explore west to avoid looping between the launderette and bathroom. 

The user's goal is to recover the paper towel from the safe, which might be in a different location. But the current path seems to be stuck between the launderette and bathroom. The key is to move west from the bathroom to proceed further. 

So the next action should be to go west from the bathroom. That's the logical step to avoid looping and progress towards the safe.

You're now in a playroom.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in TextWorld. The goal seems to be to reach a safe place and recover the paper towel. Let me break down the steps.

First, the initial instructions said to go south, then west, then south again, west, and so on. But the user is now in the Playroom. The previous actions were going south from the launderette, then west to the bathroom, then west again to the playroom. 

Looking at the current room, the Playroom has exits to the east, south, and west. The user needs to continue moving in a way that progresses towards the safe. The next step might be to go east, as the instruction mentioned traveling east after some steps. But I need to check if there's a loop. The user has been moving west and south, but maybe they need to go east to avoid looping.

Wait, the user's past actions include going south, west, west, and now in the playroom. The next step according to the initial plan was to go east. So the next command should be "go east".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in TextWorld. The goal mentioned earlier was to move through various directions: south, west, south again, west, then north, east, north, and finally west to recover a paper towel from a safe.

Looking at the current situation, the user is in the Bathroom again. The previous steps led them back here. The exits available are north and west. The user has already tried going west and east, but it seems like they're looping between the Bathroom and Playroom.

The key here is to break the loop. Since going west and east keeps bringing them back, maybe they need to find another way. But the exits are only north and west. Wait, the initial instruction said to go south first, then west, then south again, west, then north, east, north, and west. But they might be stuck in a cycle between Bathroom and Playroom.

The next step should be to try going north from the Bathroom. The user was told to try going north when in the Bathroom. So the next action should be 'go north' to proceed further and avoid the loop.

Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game where they have to navigate through different rooms and probably collect items. The initial instructions mentioned moving in certain directions and finding a paper towel from a safe. But now, after several moves, they're back in the launderette.

Looking at the current room description, there's an unguarded exit to the north, south, and west. The user has been moving between rooms, but they might be stuck in a loop. The goal was to recover the paper towel from the safe, but so far, they haven't found any mention of a safe or paper towel. 

Wait, the user's previous actions were going south, west, east, north, and now back to the launderette. The bathroom and playroom didn't have any items mentioned. The safe and paper towel might be in another area. But the current room is the launderette, which is described as normal. Maybe the safe is in the launderette, but the user hasn't checked there yet.

The user's next step should be to check the items in the launderette. Since the exits are all unguarded, maybe the safe is in the launderette. The user needs to look for the safe and then take the paper towel. But the previous actions didn't mention any items, so maybe the safe is here. The user should check the room for the safe and then take the paper towel. However, the user's last action was going north, which brought them back to the launderette. So the next step is to look for the safe in the launderette and take the paper towel.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in TextWorld, following a specific path. The goal mentioned earlier was to pick up a paper towel from a safe and probably get to a laundry room or something similar.

First, I need to recall the steps they've taken. They started by going south, then west, south again, west, north, and then east. But now they're back in the launderette, and the previous attempt to take the paper towel from the safe failed because it wasn't there.

So, the current room is the launderette. The user tried to take the paper towel from the safe, but there's no such item. The next step would be to check where the safe is. Maybe the safe is in another room, like the bathroom or playroom. They need to explore those areas again.

Looking at the previous rooms: the bathroom had a trunk and an opened dresser. The playroom had exits to east, south, west. Maybe the safe is in the bathroom. The user needs to go back to the bathroom, check the trunk or dresser for the paper towel.

But the user is currently in the launderette. The exits here are north, south, west. They need to go back to the bathroom. Let's see: from the launderette, going west would take them to the playroom again. Then maybe east to the bathroom? Wait, earlier when they were in the playroom, they could go east to the bathroom. So the path would be: launderette -> west to playroom -> east to bathroom. Then check the trunk or dresser for the paper towel.

But the user's last action was in the launderette. So the next step is to go west to the playroom, then east to the bathroom. Then check the trunk or dresser. Alternatively, maybe the safe is in the bathroom. So the correct sequence is to go back to the bathroom, check the trunk or dresser for the paper towel.

But the user tried to take it from the safe in the launderette, which didn't exist. So the next action should be to go back to the bathroom and look for the paper towel there. So the next command would be to go west to the playroom, then east to the bathroom. But since the user is in the launderette, the first step is to go west to the playroom. Then from there, east to the bathroom. Then check the trunk or dresser.

You've entered a lounge. You begin looking for stuff.

You can see a desk. You shudder, but continue examining the desk. You see a key on the desk.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the north.

Okay, let's try to figure out what's going on here. The user is in a TextWorld game, and their goal is to "recover the paper towel from the safe." So far, they've been moving around different rooms: starting in the launderette, then a bathroom, playroom, and now a lounge. In the lounge, they found a key on the desk.

The problem is that the user tried to take the paper towel from the safe earlier, but it wasn't there. Now, they need to find a way to get the paper towel. Since they found a key, maybe they need to use it to open a door or a safe. The key is on the desk in the lounge. So the next step would be to pick up the key. Then, they might need to use it to access the safe where the paper towel is. But the user hasn't picked up the key yet. So the correct action here is to take the key from the desk. That makes sense because without the key, they can't open the safe. So the next command should be "take key from desk" or something similar. But the system might expect a specific command format. Let me check the previous interactions. The user previously tried "take paper towel from safe" which didn't work. Now, they need to get the key first. So the next action is to take the key.
