Welcome to TextWorld! Here is how to play! First of all, make an effort to head north. With that accomplished, ensure that the passageway is open. After that, make an effort to move east. Then, lift the nest of earwigs from the floor of the attic. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Laundry Place =-
This might come as a shock to you, but you've just stumbled into a laundry place. You begin looking for stuff.

You can make out a board. You wonder idly who left that here. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Sometimes, just sometimes, TextWorld can just be the worst.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north.

-= Cubicle =-
You are in a cubicle. A standard one. The room is well lit.

You can see a safe. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You can make out a table. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is a closed passageway leading east. There is a closed portal leading north. There is an open hatch leading west. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Attic =-
You've stumbled into an usual room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be usual. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the attic.

You make out a workbench. The workbench is typical. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is an open passageway leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

There is a nest of earwigs on the floor.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in the Attic scene. The goal is to lift the nest of earwigs to win. They tried "lift nest of earwigs" but it's not recognized. The system says it's not a valid verb.

First, I need to recall the steps. The original plan was: go north, open passageway, go east, lift the earwigs. But in the current scene, they're in the Attic. The correct action here is to lift the nest. The problem is the syntax.

Maybe the correct command is "lift the nest of earwigs" with the article "the". The user tried "lift nest of earwigs" without "the", which might be why it's not recognized. So the next step is to include "the" in the command. That should make it a valid action. Let me check the previous attempts. The user tried "lift the nest of earwigs" but it's still not working. Wait, maybe the game expects a different phrasing. Alternatively, maybe "pick up" is the verb instead of "lift". But the original instruction said "lift the nest of earwigs". Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the game requires "take" instead of "lift". But the user's previous attempts used "lift". 

Wait, the user's last attempt was "lift the nest of earwigs" and the system said it's not recognized. So perhaps the correct verb is "pick up" or "take". But the original instruction said "lift". Maybe the game's parser is strict. So the next step is to try a different verb. But the user's goal is to lift it. Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "lift the nest" without "of earwigs"? But the description says the nest is of earwigs. 

Alternatively, maybe the game expects "lift" followed by the object, but the object needs to be properly specified. Maybe "lift the nest" is sufficient, and "earwigs" is part of the description. But the user's previous attempt included "of earwigs". 

Wait, the game's message says "There is a nest of earwigs on the floor." So the correct action is to lift that specific nest. So the command should be "lift the nest of earwigs". But the system says it's not recognized. Maybe the game uses "take" instead of "lift". Let me think. In TextWorld, sometimes verbs can vary. Maybe the correct verb is "take". So the user should try "take the nest of earwigs". But the original instruction said "lift". 

Alternatively, maybe the game expects "pick up" instead of "lift". But the user's previous attempts used "lift". 

Given that the user is stuck, the next step is to try a different verb. Since "lift" isn't working, perhaps "take" or "pick up" is the correct verb. But the user's previous attempts used "lift". So the correct action here is to use "take" instead. Therefore, the next command should be "take the nest of earwigs".
