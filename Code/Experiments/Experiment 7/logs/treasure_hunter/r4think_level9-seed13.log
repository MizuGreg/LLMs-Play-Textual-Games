Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First stop, make an attempt to move east. Then, try to move east. Then, move north. With that done, take a trip west. And then, recover the passkey from the floor of the bar. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Chamber =-
You find yourself in a chamber. A standard one. The room is well lit.



There is an unguarded exit to the east.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to recover the passkey from the bar's floor and then stop. So far, the steps taken are: go east from the chamber to the laundromat, then east again to the canteen, then north to the closet, and west back to the bar. Now, in the bar, the passkey is on the floor. The next step should be to pick up the passkey. But the user's last action was going west, which led to the bar. The current location is the bar, and the passkey is there. So the next action should be to pick up the passkey. However, the game might require interacting with it, like picking it up. So the correct command would be to take the passkey.
</think>take passkey
