You are now playing a exciting episode of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First off, make an attempt to venture east. If you can succeed at that, attempt to take a trip east. And then, recover the keycard from the floor of the workshop. And once you've done that, you win!

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Cubicle and Laundromat. They keep going east and west, but it's not making progress towards the goal. The original goal was to venture east, then take a trip east, recover the keycard from the workshop, and win.

Wait, the user's past actions have been alternating between going east and west, which just keeps them bouncing between the two locations. That's not moving them closer to the workshop where the keycard is. So the next step should be to find a way to get to the workshop. But how?

Looking at the current environment, when they're in the Cubicle, there's an exit to the north. The original instruction said to first attempt to venture east, then take a trip east. But maybe the key is to go north from the Cubicle. The exit to the north is unblocked. Maybe that's the way to the workshop. The user hasn't tried that yet. So instead of continuing to go east and west, they should go north. That would be the next logical step to break the loop and move towards the workshop where the keycard is located.

You can't go that way.

There is a legume on the floor.
