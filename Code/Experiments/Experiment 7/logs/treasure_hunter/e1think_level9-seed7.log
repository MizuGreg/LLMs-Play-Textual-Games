I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! First of all, take a trip north. And then, make an attempt to go to the west. And then, try to take a trip north. Then, take a trip east. And then, recover the key from the floor of the washroom. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Bedroom =-
Well how about that, you are in the place we're calling the bedroom.



There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unblocked exit to the south. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and find a key to win. The initial steps they took were going north from the bedroom to the dish-pit. Now, they're in the dish-pit, and the instructions mention trying to go west next.

First, I need to recall the game's goal: recover the key from the washroom floor and win. The user has already moved north once, leading them to the dish-pit. The next step according to the initial instructions was to go west. But in the current room (dish-pit), the available exits are north, south, and west. The user is told to try going west. However, if that doesn't work, they might be stuck in a loop.

Looking at the previous actions: the user went north from the bedroom, then in the dish-pit, they need to go west. But the response after going west might lead them back or to another room. The key is to avoid loops. If going west doesn't work, maybe they need to try a different direction or use a synonym for the action. But the user's next action should be to go west. However, the system message says to check if they're in a loop and adjust if necessary. Since the previous action was going north, then west, maybe the next step is to go north again. But the user needs to find the key in the washroom. So perhaps after moving west, they need to find the correct path to the washroom. Alternatively, maybe the correct sequence is north, west, north, east, then find the key. But the user is currently in the dish-pit, so the next step is to go west. If that doesn't work, maybe they need to try another direction. But according to the initial instructions, after going north, then west, then north again. So the next action should be west.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in TextWorld to recover the key from the washroom and win the game. Let me break down the steps they've taken so far.

First, they started in the bedroom, went north to the dish-pit, then west to the lounge. Now they're in the lounge, which has a keycard on the floor. The goal is to recover the key from the washroom. Wait, the keycard is in the lounge. But the user's previous steps didn't mention the washroom yet. Maybe they need to find the washroom and get the key from there. But the keycard is here in the lounge. Hmm, maybe the keycard is the key they need. But the instruction says to recover the key from the floor of the washroom. So perhaps the keycard in the lounge is a clue, but the actual key is in the washroom. 

Wait, the user's last action was going west from the dish-pit to the lounge. Now in the lounge, they see a keycard on the floor. The goal is to recover the key from the washroom. So maybe they need to go to the washroom, pick up the key, and then exit. But how to get to the washroom? The previous rooms were bedroom -> dish-pit -> lounge. The lounge has an exit to the east and north. The user needs to find the washroom. Maybe the washroom is connected via north from the lounge? Let me check the previous descriptions. 

In the dish-pit, the user could go north or west. Then from the dish-pit, they went west to the lounge. The lounge has an exit to the east and north. The user needs to go north from the lounge to find the washroom. But the current description says the lounge has an exit to the east and north. So maybe going north from the lounge leads to the washroom. Then, in the washroom, there's a key on the floor. So the steps would be: go north from the lounge to the washroom, take the key, then exit. But the user hasn't done that yet. 

Wait, the user's last action was in the lounge. The next step would be to go north to the washroom. Then take the key. Then maybe go back through the rooms to exit. But the user's previous actions didn't mention the washroom. So the next action should be to go north from the lounge to reach the washroom. Then pick up the key. Then maybe go back through the exits to reach the exit. But the user needs to make sure they take the key from the washroom. So the keycard in the lounge might be a red herring, or maybe it's the key. But the instruction says to recover the key from the washroom. So the key is in the washroom. Therefore, the user needs to go north from the lounge to the washroom, take the key, then exit. 

So the next action is to go north from the lounge. But the user is currently in the lounge. The current description says: "There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north." So the user should go north from the lounge. Then, in the washroom, take the key. Then exit. So the next step is to go north.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in TextWorld to recover the key from the washroom and win the game. Let me recap the steps so far.

First, they started in the bedroom, went north to the dish-pit, then west to the lounge. In the lounge, they found a keycard on the floor. Then they went north to the parlor. The goal is to recover the key from the washroom's floor and then win.

Wait, the keycard is in the lounge. But the user hasn't picked it up yet. The next step would be to take the keycard. But the current room is the parlor. So maybe they need to go back to the lounge to pick it up. But the parlor has exits to east and south. Let me check the previous steps.

In the lounge, after finding the keycard, they went north to the parlor. So now they're in the parlor. To get back to the lounge, they should go south. Then pick up the keycard. Once they have it, they need to find the washroom. From the parlor, maybe going east leads to the washroom? Or perhaps another path. But the key is in the lounge, so the user needs to go back to the lounge, take the key, then proceed to the washroom.

But the user hasn't picked up the key yet. So the next action should be to go south from the parlor back to the lounge, pick up the keycard. Then proceed to the washroom. But the current room is the parlor. So the next command should be to go south to return to the lounge.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in TextWorld to win the game. The goal is to recover the key from the washroom floor and then proceed to the next step, which I assume involves using the key to open a door or something similar.

Looking at the history of commands given so far: the user started by going north from the bedroom, then west to the dish-pit, then east to the lounge, north to the parlor, south back to the lounge. Now they're in the lounge again, which they've been in before. The keycard is on the floor here. 

The previous actions led them back to the lounge, which suggests a loop. The key is in the lounge, so the next logical step is to pick up the keycard. But the user hasn't done that yet. The instruction says to recover the key from the washroom, but in the current room (lounge), there's a keycard on the floor. Maybe the washroom is another room, but the key is here. Wait, the original instruction said "recover the key from the floor of the washroom," but in the current room, the key is on the floor. Maybe the washroom is the lounge? Or perhaps there's a mistake in the room names. 

Assuming that the keycard in the lounge is the one needed for the washroom, the user needs to pick it up. The previous actions didn't include picking up the key, so the next step should be to take the keycard. But the user's last action was going south, which brought them back to the lounge. Now, in the lounge, the key is present. So the correct action here is to take the keycard. However, the user's previous commands were moving around, and they haven't picked up the key yet. Therefore, the next step is to take the keycard from the floor.
