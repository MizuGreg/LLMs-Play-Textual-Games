-= Bathroom =-
You are in a bathroom. A typical kind of place.

You can make out a closed drawer. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a bench. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

There is an unguarded exit to the south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

-= Study =-
Well I'll be, you are in a place we're calling a study. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.
