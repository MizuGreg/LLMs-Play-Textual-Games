Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! First thing I need you to do is to take a trip east. Next, take a trip south. Next, make an effort to go to the south. And then, go south. Once you accomplish that, lift the mop from the floor of the laundry place. Alright, thanks!

-= Cubicle =-
You arrive in a cubicle. A typical one.

If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a box. You can see a mantelpiece. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user wants me to figure out the next action in this TextWorld game. Let me start by recalling the goal. The initial instructions said to go east, then south, then south again, then pick up the mop from the laundry place.

Looking at the current location: the user is in the Bedroom. The previous moves were go east (to Garage), then south (to Cookery), then west (to Bedroom). Wait, but the original plan was to go east, then south, then south again. But the user already went east once, then south once, then west. Hmm, maybe I got lost in the directions.

Wait, the first step was to go east from the Cubicle. Then south from Garage, then south again from Cookery. But the user's last action was go west from Cookery to Bedroom. That might not align with the original plan. Maybe the user is in a loop between Cookery and Bedroom?

The goal is to lift the mop from the laundry place. So maybe the laundry place is in a different area. Let me check the locations again. The Cubicle had a box and an exit east. Garage had a coffer. Cookery had exits north, south, west. Bedroom has a chest and exits west, east, north, south.

Wait, the original plan was to go east, then south, then south again. But after going east (Garage), then south (Cookery), then south again would be... but Cookery's south exit is unblocked. Wait, in the Cookery description, there's an exit to the south. So going south from Cookery would take the user to another area. But the user went west from Cookery to Bedroom. Maybe the user is not following the original plan correctly.

Alternatively, maybe the user is in a loop between Cookery and Bedroom. Because from Cookery, going west leads to Bedroom, and from Bedroom, going east leads back to Cookery. So if the user keeps going west and east, they're stuck. The original plan was to go south twice, but maybe the user is going west instead. So the next step should be to go south from Cookery, not west. But the user just went west, so maybe they need to correct that.

Wait, the user's last action was go west from Cookery to Bedroom. Now, in the Bedroom, the exits are west (portal), east (unblocked), north, south. The original plan was to go south again. But the user is in Bedroom now. So maybe the next step is to go east from Bedroom to Cookery again, then try going south from Cookery. But that's going back. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go south from Bedroom. Wait, the Bedroom has an unblocked exit to the south. So going south from Bedroom would take the user to another area. Let me check the previous locations. From Cookery, going south would be to... maybe the laundry place? But the user is in Bedroom now. So perhaps the correct path is to go south from Bedroom. But I need to make sure.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east from Bedroom to Cookery, then south to another area. But the original plan was to go east, then south, then south again. So after going east (Garage), then south (Cookery), then south again (maybe to Laundry?), but the user went west instead. So the user is off track. The next step should be to go south from Cookery, not west. But the user is in Bedroom, so maybe they need to go east back to Cookery, then south. But that's a loop. Alternatively, maybe the user is in the Bedroom and needs to go south from there. Let me check the Bedroom description again: "There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an unblocked exit to the south." So going south from Bedroom would be possible. But where does that lead? Maybe to the Laundry place where the mop is. So the next action should be go south from Bedroom. But the user is in Bedroom now, so the next command is go south.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to pick up the mop from the laundry place. The initial steps were to go east, then south, then south again. But the user ended up in the Studio after going east from Scullery. Now, in the Studio, the exits are north, south, and west. The previous actions didn't lead to the laundry place yet. The user is in a loop between Scullery and Studio, moving east and west. To break the loop, they need to go a different direction. The next step should be to go north from Studio to reach the laundry place. But wait, the original plan was to go south twice. Maybe the user needs to go north from Studio to find the laundry place. Alternatively, maybe the laundry place is in the north. So the next action is go north.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Cookery and Bedroom, moving back and forth. The goal is to pick up the mop from the laundry place. The initial plan was to go east, south, south, then get the mop. But the user ended up in the Studio and then back to Cookery and Bedroom.

The current location is Bedroom again. The exits are north, south, east, west. The user has been going west and east, which is causing the loop. The key is to find the laundry place. Maybe the laundry place is in the north from Cookery. But the user is in Bedroom now. Wait, the original plan was to go south twice from the starting point. Maybe the user needs to go north from Cookery to reach the laundry place. But the user is in Bedroom, so maybe going north from here would take them to Scullery, then east to Studio, then north to Cookery again. This isn't working.

Alternatively, maybe the mop is in the chest in the Bedroom. The user saw a chest in the Bedroom. So maybe they need to open the chest and take the mop from there. The previous steps didn't mention the chest, so perhaps that's the missing piece. The user needs to check the chest in the Bedroom. So the next action should be to open the chest and take the mop.

Okay, let's see. The user's goal is to pick up the mop from the laundry place. So far, they've been moving around different rooms, but haven't found the mop yet. The last action was going north to the Cubicle, which has a box and a mantelpiece, but nothing on it. The user needs to find the laundry place where the mop is.

Looking at the current location, the Cubicle has an exit to the east and south.

Wait, the user was told to take the mop from the laundry place, not the box here. But maybe the laundry place is in another room.

Alternatively, the user might have missed the mop in a previous room. The initial plan was to go east, south, south, then get the mop. But the user ended up in the Cubicle again.

FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to pick up the mop from the laundry place. So far, they've been moving between rooms without finding the mop. The current location is Cookery, and the previous actions have led them in a loop between Cookery, Bedroom, Cubicle, and Garage.

The key here is to find the laundry place where the mop is. The initial instructions said to go east, then south, then south again. But the user has been going back and forth between rooms. Maybe the laundry place is in the north from Cookery. But the user is in Cookery now. The exits are north and west. Going north would take them to the Bedroom again, which has an empty chest. Going west leads to the Bedroom again. So maybe the user needs to check the box in the Cubicle again. The Cubicle has a box by the wall. The user hasn't checked that yet. So the next step is to go east from Cubicle to check the box. But the user is in Cookery now. The previous action was go east from Cookery, which led to the Bedroom. Wait, maybe the user needs to go south from Cookery to reach the Laundry place. But the user is in Cookery, and the south exit is unblocked. Let me check the previous steps. The user went south from Cookery to Bedroom, then east to Cookery again. So they're stuck in a loop. The correct path should be to go east from the Cubicle to the Garage, then south to the Laundry place. But the user is in Cookery. So the next action should be to go north from Cookery to the Bedroom, then east to Cookery again. No, that's not helping. Maybe the user needs to go west from Cookery to the Bedroom, then north to the Cubicle, then east to the Garage, then south to the Laundry place. But the user hasn't found the Laundry place yet. The initial plan was to go east, south, south. So after going east (Garage), then south (Cookery), then south again (Laundry). But the user is in Cookery. So the next step is to go south from Cookery to the Laundry place. But the user is in Cookery, and the south exit is unblocked. So the next action is to go south from Cookery.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Cubicle, Garage, Cookery, Bedroom, and Studio. The goal is to pick up the mop from the laundry place. The user has been moving around without finding the mop. The initial plan was to go east, then south, then south again. But the user ended up in the Cubicle again.

The key is to find the laundry place. The user hasn't checked the box in the Cubicle yet. The box is by the wall, and the mantelpiece is empty. Maybe the mop is in the box. The user needs to check the box. So the next action is to look in the box. But the user is in the Cubicle. The previous actions didn't mention checking the box. So the correct step is to check the box in the Cubicle. The command should be "look in box" or "check box". But the user needs to use the correct command. The previous actions used "go east", "go south", etc. So the next step is to check the box in the Cubicle.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to pick up the mop from the laundry place. So far, they've been moving between rooms without finding the mop. The current location is the Cubicle, where they opened a box but didn't find the mop. The previous actions led them in a loop between various rooms.

The key is to find the laundry place where the mop is. The user needs to check the box again, but it's closed. They tried opening it, but maybe the correct command is different. Alternatively, maybe the mop is in another room. The initial plan was to go east, south, south, then get the mop. The user might have missed the laundry place in a different area. The next step is to check the box again, but using the correct command. Since "open box" didn't work, maybe "look in box" or "check box". But the system says "That's not a verb I recognise." So the correct command is "open box" again. Wait, they already tried that. Maybe the mop is in the Garage or another room. The user needs to break the loop and find the correct path. The next action should be to go east from the Cubicle to the Garage, then south to the Laundry place.

FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.
