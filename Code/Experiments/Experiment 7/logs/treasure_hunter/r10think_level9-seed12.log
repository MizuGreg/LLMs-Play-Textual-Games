THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Shower and Laundromat rooms. The goal is to eventually pick up the passkey and win. Let me retrace the steps.

First, the initial objective was to go north, then north again, then east, south, pick up the passkey. But the user keeps looping between Shower and Laundromat. The passkey is in the cellar, maybe? Wait, the user hasn't found the passkey yet. The current location is Shower, and the previous steps led to the same place again.

So the problem is the loop. The user is going back and forth between Shower and Laundromat. The next step should be to find the passkey. But where is it? The user needs to check the cellar. Wait, in the Cellar, there's an exit to the south. Maybe the passkey is in the Cellar. But the user hasn't checked there yet. However, the user's last action was going west from the Cellar back to Shower. So maybe they need to explore the Cellar more thoroughly.

Alternatively, maybe the passkey is in the Laundromat. The user saw a towel on the floor. But the goal says to pick up the passkey from the floor of the chamber. Wait, the initial instruction said "pick-up the passkey from the floor of the chamber." So maybe the chamber is the Laundromat? But the user hasn't picked it up yet. However, the user is stuck in a loop, so they need to break the cycle.

The user needs to find a way to get to the Cellar and check for the passkey. Since the Cellar has an exit to the south, maybe the passkey is there. But the user is stuck in the Shower room, so they need to go south to the Laundromat again, then north to the Shower, then east to the Cellar. Wait, but that's the same loop. Maybe the passkey is in the Cellar, and the user needs to go west from the Cellar to the Shower, then find another way.

Alternatively, maybe the user should try going east from the Shower again. But the user tried that before. The problem is the loop. So the next action should be to go east from the Shower to the Cellar, then check for the passkey there. But the user is currently in the Shower, so the next step is to go east. But the user already did that. Wait, the last action was go south from the Shower to Laundromat, then go north back to Shower. So the user needs to try going east from the Shower again to the Cellar, then check the Cellar for the passkey. But the user hasn't checked the Cellar yet. So the next action should be go east from the Shower to the Cellar, then check the floor for the passkey. But the user is in the Shower, so the next command is go east.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is stuck in a loop between the Shower and Cellar rooms. The goal is to pick up the passkey from the floor of the chamber. So far, the user has been moving back and forth between these rooms without finding the passkey.

First, the goal steps are: go north, then north again, then east, south, pick up the passkey. But the user is stuck in a loop, so they need to find a way out of that cycle.

Looking at the current position, the user is in the Cellar, and the only exit is south. The previous actions of going west and east are leading back to the same places. The user hasn't checked the Cellar properly for the passkey. Maybe the passkey is in the Cellar, but the user hasn't looked closely enough.

The user tried "look around" but got a negative response. Maybe they need to check the floor again or look for something else. Alternatively, maybe the passkey is in the Laundromat, but the user hasn't checked there either.

Since the user is in the Cellar and the only exit is south, the next step should be to go south back to the Laundromat. Then check the floor there for the passkey. The user might have missed it before because they were moving around too much. So the next action should be to go south from the Cellar to the Laundromat and look for the passkey there.
