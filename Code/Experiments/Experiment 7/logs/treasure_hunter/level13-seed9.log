Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First off, try to take a trip west. And then, make an attempt to venture west. And then, make an attempt to head north. If you can do that, lift the poem from the floor of the bedchamber. And if you do that, you're the winner!

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Dish-Pit and Garage. The goal is to lift the poem from the bedchamber. The initial steps were going west, then north, but now they're bouncing between the Dish-Pit and Garage.

First, I need to recall the original instructions. The user had to go west, then west again, then north. But after that, they were supposed to lift the poem from the bedchamber. However, the current path seems to be looping between Dish-Pit and Garage. 

Looking at the current location, the user is in the Dish-Pit, which has an open hatch south and a west exit. The Garage has an east exit. The user keeps going west and east, which is causing the loop. 

The problem is that the user hasn't reached the bedchamber yet. The path to the bedchamber might be through the basement, attic, or another area. But the current movement is not leading towards that. 

Wait, the initial steps were: go west (from Canteen to Sauna), then north (to Basement), then north again (to Attic), then north again (to Dish-Pit). But the user is now stuck in a loop between Dish-Pit and Garage. Maybe the correct path is to go south from Dish-Pit back to the basement, then find the chest or safe, and then proceed to the bedchamber. 

But the user hasn't tried going south from the Dish-Pit. The Dish-Pit has an open hatch south. So maybe the next step is to go south from Dish-Pit to the basement, then check the locked chest or safe. However, the user is currently in Dish-Pit and the last action was go west to Garage. So the next action should be to go south from Dish-Pit instead of west. 

But the user's previous actions were going west repeatedly, leading to the loop. So the key is to break the loop by choosing a different direction. Instead of going west, go south from Dish-Pit to reach the basement again. Then, perhaps interact with the locked chest or safe to proceed. 

Therefore, the next action should be to go south from the Dish-Pit, which is the correct direction to escape the loop and reach the basement where the chest is located. Then, after opening the chest, proceed to the bedchamber to lift the poem.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's try to figure out how to win this game. The user's goal is to lift the poem from the bedchamber. The initial steps mentioned were to go west, then west again, then north. But the user is now stuck in a loop between the Dish-Pit and Garage.

Looking at the current situation, the user is in the Garage, and the only exit is east. They tried going west, but that leads back to the Dish-Pit. The problem is that the user hasn't reached the bedchamber yet. The path to the bedchamber might be through the basement, attic, or another area. However, the user's movements have been looping between Dish-Pit and Garage without progressing.

The user needs to break the loop. Since going west and east isn't working, maybe they need to find another way. The Garage has an empty crate and rack, but nothing useful. The key might be to find a different path. Perhaps the user needs to go back to the basement and interact with the locked chest or safe mentioned earlier. But how?

Wait, the user was in the basement earlier. The basement had a locked chest and a safe. Maybe the user needs to open that chest or safe to proceed. But the user hasn't interacted with it yet. However, the current location is the Garage, so they need to find a way back to the basement.

The Dish-Pit has an open hatch south. Maybe the user should go south from the Dish-Pit to the basement. But earlier attempts to go south from Dish-Pit were blocked. Wait, the user was in the Garage, and the last action was going west to the Dish-Pit. The Dish-Pit has an open hatch south, which should lead back to the basement. But the user tried going south from the Garage and couldn't. Maybe the user needs to go back to the Dish-Pit and then south.

But the user is currently in the Garage, and the only exit is east. So the user needs to go east back to the Dish-Pit, then south to the basement. Then, in the basement, interact with the locked chest or safe. Once that's done, proceed to the bedchamber to lift the poem.

So the next step is to go east from the Garage back to the Dish-Pit, then south to the basement. Then, open the chest or safe. After that, proceed north to the attic, then maybe to the bedchamber. But the user needs to break the loop by not repeating the same actions. The previous actions of going west and east were causing the loop, so changing direction to south when possible is necessary.

The problem is that the user hasn't reached the bedchamber yet. The path to the bedchamber might be through the basement, attic, or another area. However, the user's movements have been looping between Dish-Pit and Garage without progressing.

The user needs to break the loop. Since going west and east isn't working, maybe they need to find another way. The Garage has an empty crate and rack, but nothing useful. The key might be to find a different path. Perhaps the user needs to go back to the basement and interact with the locked chest or safe mentioned earlier. But how?

Wait, the user was in the basement earlier. The basement had a locked chest and a safe. Maybe the user needs to open that chest or safe to proceed. But the user hasn't interacted with it yet. However, the current location is the Garage, so they need to find a way back to the basement.

The Dish-Pit has an open hatch south. Maybe the user should go south from the Dish-Pit to the basement. But the user tried going south from the Garage and couldn't. Maybe the user needs to go back to the Dish-Pit and then south. Then, in the basement, interact with the locked chest or safe. Once that's done, proceed to the bedchamber to lift the poem.

So the next step is to go east from the Garage back to the Dish-Pit, then south to the basement. Then, open the chest or safe. After that, proceed north to the attic, then maybe to the bedchamber. But the user needs to break the loop by not repeating the same actions. The previous actions of going west and east were causing the loop, so changing direction to south when possible is necessary.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

-= Garage =-
You've just sauntered into a garage. The room is well lit.

You can make out an opened crate. The crate is empty! What a waste of a day! You can see a rack. You shudder, but continue examining the rack. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

There is an unblocked exit to the east.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out how to win this game. The user's goal is to lift the poem from the bedchamber. The initial steps mentioned were to go west, then west again, then north. But the user is now stuck in a loop between the Dish-Pit and Garage.

Looking at the current situation, the user is in the Garage, and the only exit is east. They tried going west, but that leads back to the Dish-Pit. The problem is that the user hasn't reached the bedchamber yet. The path to the bedchamber might be through the basement, attic, or another area. However, the user's movements have been looping between Dish-Pit and Garage without progressing.

The user needs to break the loop. Since going west and east isn't working, maybe they need to find another way. The Garage has an empty crate and rack, but nothing useful. The key might be to find a different path. Perhaps the user needs to go back to the basement and interact with the locked chest or safe mentioned earlier. But how?

Wait, the user was in the basement earlier. The basement had a locked chest and a safe. Maybe the user needs to open that chest or safe to proceed. But the user hasn't interacted with it yet. However, the current location is the Garage, so they need to find a way back to the basement.

The Dish-Pit has an open hatch south. Maybe the user should go south from the Dish-Pit to the basement. But the user tried going south from the Garage and couldn't. Maybe the user needs to go back to the Dish-Pit and then south. Then, in the basement, interact with the locked chest or safe. Once that's done, proceed to the bedchamber to lift the poem.

So the next step is to go east from the Garage back to the Dish-Pit, then south to the basement. Then, open the chest or safe. After that, proceed north to the attic, then maybe to the bedchamber. But the user needs to break the loop by not repeating the same actions. The previous actions of going west and east were causing the loop, so changing direction to south when possible is necessary.
