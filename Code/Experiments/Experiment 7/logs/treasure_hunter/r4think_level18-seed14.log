You are now playing a profound game of TextWorld! First, it would be good if you could open the gate inside the canteen. After that, attempt to go north. And then, ensure that the portal is open. And then, try to travel north. After that, go to the west. Then, go to the north. Next, make an attempt to head east. Following that, take the butterfly from the box inside the workshop. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Canteen =-
Well, here we are in a canteen.

You can see a chest. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You can make out a case.

There is a closed gate leading north. There is an open hatch leading west.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop where they keep trying to go north but the game says they need to open the gate first. The goal is to open the gate, go north, then proceed through various directions and retrieve the butterfly.

First, the goal steps are: open the north gate, go north, then west, north again, east, get the butterfly from the workshop, and win. 

So far, the user tried opening the gate north, but the game didn't recognize it. Then they tried going north, but it's blocked. They're repeating the same actions, which is the loop.

The next step should be to ensure the gate is opened properly. Maybe the correct command is "open gate north" again, but since the game didn't accept it before, maybe using "open the gate" or "open north gate" as synonyms. Alternatively, check if there's another way to trigger the gate opening. But the user's previous attempt was "open gate north", which didn't work. So maybe the correct action is to use a different phrasing. Wait, the game might require "open the gate" instead of "open gate north". Let me check the initial description. The gate is "closed gate leading north". So maybe the correct command is "open the gate" without specifying north, but the game expects "open gate north". But the user tried that and it didn't work. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to look for a key or item to open it. But the canteen has a chest and a case. Maybe the case is the key. Wait, the user saw a case. Maybe they need to open the case to get a key. But the initial instruction didn't mention that. The user's goal is to open the gate, so maybe the case is the key. But the user hasn't interacted with it yet. However, the initial problem is the gate. So the next step is to try opening the gate again, maybe using a different command. Since the game didn't accept "open gate north" before, maybe the correct command is "open the gate" or "open north gate". Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use "open gate" without the direction. But the game's message says "closed gate leading north", so maybe the direction is part of the command. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use "open gate" and the game will handle the direction. But the user's previous attempt was "open gate north", which didn't work. So the next step is to try a different command. Maybe "open gate" without the direction. Let me check the game's possible commands. The user is in the canteen, with a closed gate north and an open hatch west. The correct action is to open the gate north. But the game didn't recognize it. Maybe the user needs to use "open the gate" instead. Alternatively, maybe the game requires "open gate north" but the user's previous input was incorrect. Wait, the user's first attempt was "open gate north", which the game didn't recognize. Then they tried "go north", which was blocked. Then again "open gate north", which the game didn't recognize. So maybe the correct command is "open gate" without the direction. So the next action should be "open gate".

Okay, let's break this down. The user is trying to navigate through a text-based game. The main goal is to open gates and portals, move in certain directions, and retrieve a butterfly from a workshop to win.

First, the steps required are: open the north gate in the canteen, go north, then west, north again, east, get the butterfly, and win. But the user is stuck in a loop between the canteen and cubicle because they need to open the portal in the cubicle before proceeding north.

Looking at the previous actions: the user tried opening the gate north in the canteen, which worked, then went north into the cubicle. Now, the cubicle has a closed portal north and an open gate south. The error message says the portal needs to be opened first. So the next step is to open the portal in the cubicle.

The user previously tried "go north" again, but it's blocked. So the correct action now is to open the portal. The previous action of going north didn't work because the portal was closed. Therefore, the next command should be "open portal north" or "open the portal". Since the game might require the direction, "open portal north" is the right command here. But the user needs to make sure they use the correct phrasing. The game might expect "open portal" without the direction, but given the context, specifying "north" is necessary. So the next action is to open the portal north.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop where they keep trying to open the portal but the game isn't recognizing it. The goal is to open the gate in the canteen, go north to the cubicle, open the portal there, then proceed further.

First, the steps needed are: open the north gate in the canteen, go north to cubicle, open the north portal, then go north again, west, north, east, get the butterfly, and win. 

So far, the user opened the gate in the canteen, went north to cubicle, but the portal is closed. They tried "open portal north" multiple times, but the game isn't accepting it. Maybe the correct command is "open the portal" without specifying direction, or "open portal" as a synonym. Since the game isn't recognizing "open portal north", perhaps the direction is implied, or the command is different. The next step is to try a different phrasing, like "open portal" instead of "open portal north". That might break the loop.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through the game. The goal is to open gates and portals, move in specific directions, and retrieve the butterfly.

So far, they've opened the gate in the canteen, went north to the cubicle, opened the portal there, and now they're in the cellar. The cellar has a portal south and a passageway west. The next steps according to the initial plan were to go west, then north, then east, get the butterfly, and win. 

But the user is stuck again. The previous actions were opening the portal in the cubicle, which worked, and now they're in the cellar. The next step should be to go west through the passageway. The user might have tried going north again, but the portal is south, so maybe they need to go west. The passageway west is open, so the correct command is "go west". That should move them to the next area. Let me check the previous steps again. The user was in the cubicle, opened the portal, went north to the cellar. Now, the cellar has a west passageway. So the next step is to go west. That's the next part of the plan. So the answer should be "go west".

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Workshop, which is the final area. The goal is to take the butterfly from the box inside the workshop. The previous steps have led them here: opened gates, navigated through different areas, and now they're in the workshop. The box is here, and the butterfly is inside. The next step is to take the butterfly. The user needs to pick it up from the box. The command should be "take butterfly" or "take from box". Since the box is mentioned as containing the butterfly, the correct action is to take it from the box. The user hasn't done that yet, so that's the next step. No loops here, just the final action.
