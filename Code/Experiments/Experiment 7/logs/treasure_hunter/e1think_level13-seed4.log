It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! First thing I need you to do is to venture east. If you can get around to doing that, attempt to travel south. Following that, travel south. Then, retrieve the napkin from the floor of the scullery. Alright, thanks!

-= Shower =-
You find yourself in a shower. A typical kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

You can see a closed box in the room. You make out a locked safe.

There is an open door leading east. There is an unguarded exit to the south. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

-= Cookery =-
You are in an usual kind of place. That is to say, you're in a cookery.

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a table. On the table you can make out a stick of butter. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now.

There is an open portal leading south. There is an open door leading west.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text-based game where they need to follow specific steps to reach the napkin in the scullery. The initial instructions were to go east, then south, then south again, and finally retrieve the napkin.

First, the user started in the shower, went east to the cookery. Now, in the cookery, there's a portal south and a door west. The next step according to the original plan was to go south again. But the user is at the cookery now. So, the next action should be to go south through the portal. 

Wait, the user's previous action was "go east" from the shower. Then they are in the cookery. The next step in the original plan was to travel south. The cookery has an open portal south. So the next step is to go south from the cookery. Then, after that, they need to go south again, and then get the napkin. But the user hasn't done that yet. 

The user's current location is the cookery. The next step is to go south. So the correct command here is "go south". The user needs to follow the steps in order: east, then south, then south again, then get the napkin. Since they're in the cookery now, the next step is to go south through the portal. That's the logical next move.

-= Canteen =-
You are in a canteen. A standard kind of place.



There is an open portal leading north. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in TextWorld. The goal is to venture east, then south, then south again, and retrieve the napkin from the scullery.

First, the initial steps: they started in the shower, went east to the cookery, then south to the canteen. Now they're in the canteen, with a portal north and an exit south. The next step according to the original plan was to go south again. But maybe there's a loop here? Let me check the previous steps.

Wait, the user's goal was to go east first, then south twice. But after going east from the shower, they went south to the cookery, then south again to the canteen. Now, from the canteen, going south would be the next step. But the canteen's south exit is unguarded. However, the original plan was to go south twice. Maybe they need to check if they've already done that. Let me retrace:

1. Start in shower, go east (done).
2. Cookery, go south (first south step, done).
3. Canteen, go south (second south step, needed). So the next action should be south again. But the user is in the canteen now. The canteen has a portal north and an exit south. So going south from here would be the next step. But the user's previous action was going south from cookery to canteen. Now, from canteen, going south again would be the second south step. Then, after that, they need to retrieve the napkin from the scullery. But the scullery might be in another direction. However, the user hasn't reached the scullery yet. So the next step is to go south again from the canteen. But the user's last action was going south to the canteen. So the next step is to go south again. But maybe there's a loop? Let me check the rooms again.

Wait, the canteen's south exit is unguarded. So going south from canteen would take them to the next room. The original plan was to go east, then south, then south. So after the first south (cookery), then second south (canteen), then maybe another south? Or perhaps the scullery is in a different direction. But the user's goal was to get to the scullery's floor to retrieve the napkin. So maybe after canteen, going south again would lead to the scullery. But the user hasn't reached that yet. So the next step is to go south again. However, the user's last action was going south to the canteen, so the next step is to go south again. But the user's previous steps might have already done that. Wait, the user is in the canteen now. The original plan was to go east, then south, then south. So after the first south (cookery), then second south (canteen). Now, the next step would be to go south again, but maybe that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe the scullery is in the north direction from canteen. But the canteen has a portal north. So perhaps the user needs to go north back to cookery, then east again? But that would be going back. Hmm, maybe the user is in a loop between canteen and cookery. But the original plan was to go east first, then south twice. So perhaps the user needs to go south again from canteen. But the canteen's south exit is unguarded. So the next action is to go south. But the user's previous action was going south to canteen. So the next step is to go south again. But maybe that's not the right path. Alternatively, maybe the scullery is in the north direction from canteen. But the user hasn't checked that yet. However, the original plan was to go east, then south, then south. So after the first two souths, the next step would be to go to the scullery. But the user is in the canteen now. So perhaps the next step is to go south again. But the user might be in a loop. However, the user's previous steps have not repeated actions. So the next action is to go south again.

-= Scullery =-
You arrive in a scullery. A standard one.

You make out a closed refrigerator here.

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

There is a napkin on the floor.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to retrieve the napkin from the scullery. So far, they've gone east from the shower, then south to the cookery, then south again to the canteen, and now they're in the scullery. The napkin is on the floor here.

Looking at the current room description, the scullery has a closed refrigerator and an exit to the north. The napkin is on the floor, so the next logical step is to pick it up. The user needs to pick up the napkin, which is the main objective. Since the previous actions led them here, the next step is to take the napkin. There's no loop here because they've successfully reached the scullery, which is the destination for the napkin. So the correct action is to pick up the napkin.
