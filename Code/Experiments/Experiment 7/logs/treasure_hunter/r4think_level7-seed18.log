Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, make an attempt to take a trip west. And then, travel south. Once you manage that, try to go east. Following that, recover the latchkey from the floor of the studio. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Cubicle =-
You arrive in a cubicle. An ordinary one.



There is an unguarded exit to the west.

There is a key on the floor.

-= Study =-
You've just walked into a study.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Workshop =-
You find yourself in a workshop.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the north.

-= Studio =-
Well I'll be, you are in a place we're calling a studio. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

There is a latchkey on the floor.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in the Studio, and they need to recover the latchkey from the floor. The previous steps were going west, then south, then east, which led them to the Studio. Now, in the Studio, there's a latchkey on the floor. The goal is to take the latchkey.

Wait, the user's last action was going east, which brought them to the Studio. The current description says there's a latchkey on the floor. So the next step should be to pick up the latchkey. But the user hasn't done that yet. The instructions said to recover the latchkey from the floor of the studio. So the next action should be to take the latchkey. But the available commands might be limited. The user is in the Studio, and the possible actions are probably 'take latchkey' or something similar. Since the previous steps were moving around, the next logical step is to pick up the latchkey. The user hasn't done that yet, so the next command should be to take the latchkey.
