Welcome to TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First thing I need you to do is to open the hatch. And then, make an effort to head west. If you can do that, attempt to head north. With that accomplished, open the passageway inside the sauna. After that, make an effort to go north. With that over with, assure that the walnut gate in the bathroom is ajar. Then, travel west. Then, attempt to move south. With that done, recover the latchkey from the floor of the closet. That's it!

-= Cubicle =-
You've just walked into a cubicle.

You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table! The table is ordinary. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. Hm. Oh well You see a bookshelf. The bookshelf is normal. However, the bookshelf, like an empty bookshelf, has nothing on it.

There is a closed hatch leading west. There is an open portal leading south.

You've come into a typical room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be typical. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the bathroom.

You make out a cabinet. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a drawer. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a trunk.

There is an open passageway leading south. There is a closed walnut gate leading west.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game where they have to follow a series of steps to complete tasks. The goal is to open various doors and navigate through different rooms, eventually recovering a latchkey from a closet.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Bathroom. The previous actions include opening the hatch, going west to the Study, then north to the Sauna, opening the passageway, going north again to the Bathroom, opening the walnut gate. Now, the next step according to the initial instructions was to travel west from the Bathroom. But the user has already opened the walnut gate, which leads west. So maybe they need to go west from the Bathroom through the walnut gate.

Wait, the current room is the Bathroom, and there's a closed walnut gate leading west. The user just opened it. So the next logical step is to go west through that gate. But the user might be stuck in a loop if they keep going back and forth. Let me check the previous steps again.

The initial task was: open hatch, go west, go north, open passageway, go north, open walnut gate, then travel west, go south, recover latchkey. So after opening the walnut gate in the Bathroom, the next step is to go west. Then, from the west side, maybe they'll reach the closet where the latchkey is. But the user might have already done that. Wait, the steps after the bathroom are: travel west (from bathroom), then attempt to move south. Then recover the latchkey from the closet.

So after opening the walnut gate, the user should go west. Then, from the next room (probably the closet or another area), they need to go south and get the latchkey. But the user is currently in the Bathroom, having opened the walnut gate. So the next action should be to go west through the opened gate. That's the next step in the sequence. The user hasn't done that yet. So the correct command here is "go west".
</think>go west

-= Office =-
You've just sauntered into an office.



There is an open walnut gate leading east. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.



>                                                                                                                                -= Office =-0/8

-= Closet =-
You find yourself in a closet. An ordinary one. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You see a stand. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north.

There is a latchkey on the floor.


>                                                                                                                                -= Closet =-0/9

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in the Closet, and there's a latchkey on the floor. The goal was to recover the latchkey from the closet. So the final step is to pick it up. But the previous actions led here. Let me check the steps again.

The initial task was: open hatch, go west, go north, open passageway, go north, open walnut gate, travel west, go south, recover latchkey. So after opening the walnut gate and going west to the Office, then south to the Closet, the next step is to pick up the latchkey. But the user hasn't done that yet. The current room is the Closet, and the latchkey is on the floor. So the correct action is to pick up the latchkey. But the game might require using a specific command like 'take latchkey' or 'get latchkey'. However, in some text games, you just pick it up by being in the room. But since the user is instructed to 'recover the latchkey from the floor of the closet', the action here is to take it. So the next command should be 'take latchkey' or similar. But the user's previous actions have already followed the steps up to this point. So the next step is to pick up the latchkey.
</think>take latchkey
