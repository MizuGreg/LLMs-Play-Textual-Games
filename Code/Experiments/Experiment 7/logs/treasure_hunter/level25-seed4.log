It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! First thing I need you to do is to go to the north. And then, go to the east. After that, go north. And then, venture west. And then, take a trip north. If you can manage that, make an effort to head east. Then, make an attempt to venture east. Then, venture south. With that accomplished, take a trip south. Next, travel east. If you can finish that, recover the frisbee from the floor of the closet. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Salon =-
You arrive in a salon. A standard one.

Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a portmanteau. A closed dresser, which looks typical, is right there by you. You can make out a desk. The desk appears to be empty. Hm. Oh well

There is an open hatch leading north. There is an open passageway leading south.

You can see a shelf. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Kitchen and Dish-Pit rooms. The goal is to recover the frisbee from the closet and win. So far, they've been going back and forth between north and south, but that's not getting them closer.

First, I need to recall the original instructions. The user was told to go north, east, north, west, north, east, east, south, south, east, then get the frisbee. But in the current setup, the exits are only to the east and south from the Dish-Pit, and the Kitchen has exits to east, north, and south. Maybe the path is blocked or they need to find a different way.

Looking at the current location: they're in the Kitchen again. The locked freezer and empty refrigerator don't help. The key is probably in the locked case or the bowl, but the bowl is empty. Wait, the user mentioned a passkey on the floor in the Cubicle. Maybe they need to pick it up and use it to open the locked case in the Dish-Pit?

But the user hasn't picked up the passkey yet. In the Cubicle, there's a passkey on the floor. So maybe they need to go back to the Cubicle, pick up the passkey, then use it to open the locked case in the Dish-Pit. Then, once the case is open, maybe the frisbee is inside or they can access the closet.

But the user's current path is looping between Kitchen and Dish-Pit. They need to go back to the Cubicle. Let me check the exits again. From the Kitchen, they can go east, north, or south. The Cubicle was north of the Salon, which was the starting point. Wait, the initial steps were: go north (to Cubicle), then north again (to Kitchen?), but maybe the path is different.

Alternatively, maybe the passkey is in the Cubicle, so they need to go back to the Cubicle, pick up the passkey, then use it to open the locked case in the Dish-Pit. Then, once the case is open, maybe the frisbee is there. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next step is to go back to the Cubicle, pick up the passkey, then go to the Dish-Pit, use the passkey to open the case, find the frisbee, and take it.

But in the current state, the user is in the Kitchen. To get to the Cubicle, they need to go south from the Kitchen to the Dish-Pit, then west to the Cubicle? Wait, in the Dish-Pit, the exit is to the east and south. Wait, the Dish-Pit has an exit to the east and south. The Cubicle was north of the Salon, which was the starting point. Maybe the Cubicle is west of the Kitchen? Not sure. But the user needs to find the passkey in the Cubicle.

So the next action should be to go west from the Kitchen to the Cubicle, pick up the passkey, then use it to open the locked case in the Dish-Pit. Then, once the case is open, maybe the frisbee is inside. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next step is to go west from the Kitchen to the Cubicle, pick up the passkey, then go back to the Dish-Pit, use the passkey to open the case, and then get the frisbee.
