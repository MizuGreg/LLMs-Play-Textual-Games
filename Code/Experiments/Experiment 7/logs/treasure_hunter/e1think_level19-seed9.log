Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First thing I need you to do is to move south. Then, open the gateway inside the studio. If you have pulled open the gateway, head west. After that, travel south. Following that, open the passageway. And then, attempt to go to the south. With that accomplished, attempt to take a trip west. Then, venture north. And then, retrieve the poem from the floor of the bedchamber. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Office =-
You've entered an office. You can barely contain your excitement.



There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

You are in an usual kind of place. That is to say, you're in a studio.

You can make out a stand. The stand is normal. However, the stand, like an empty stand, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is a closed gateway leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.

FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text-based game where they need to follow specific steps to win. The goal is to move south, open the gateway west, then proceed through various directions and retrieve a poem from a bedchamber.

First, I need to recall the current state. The user just moved south into the Studio. The Studio has a closed gateway leading west. The previous steps mentioned moving south, then opening the gateway west. But the user hasn't done that yet. The next step after moving south is to open the gateway. However, the user is at the Studio now, and the gateway is closed. So the next action should be to open the gateway. But the game might require using a specific command like 'open gateway' or 'push gateway'. The user's previous action was 'go south', so now they need to interact with the gateway. Since the gateway is closed, the correct command would be to open it. But the user might have to use the correct verb. Let me check the environment again. The studio has a closed gateway leading west. The user needs to open it. So the next step is to open the gateway. Then, after opening, go west. Then proceed as per the instructions. The user hasn't opened the gateway yet, so that's the next action.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through this TextWorld game. The goal is to follow a series of steps: move south, open the gateway, go west, south again, open the passageway, then go south, west, north, and retrieve the poem from the bedchamber.

So far, the user has already moved south from the office to the studio. Then they opened the gateway. The next step according to the initial instructions was to head west after opening the gateway. The user's last action was opening the gateway, so the next logical step would be to go west. But wait, the current location is the studio, and after opening the gateway, they need to go west. The response after opening the gateway didn't mention any new locations, so maybe going west is the next action. But the user might be in a loop if they keep doing the same things. Let me check the previous steps again.

The initial instructions said after opening the gateway, head west. Then travel south. So after opening the gateway, the user should go west. The current location is the studio, and the gateway is leading west. So the next action should be "go west". But the user might have already done that? Wait, no. The user's last action was opening the gateway, so the next step is to go west. Then after that, they need to travel south again. So the next command should be "go west".

-= Attic =-
Guess what, you are in a place we're calling an attic.

Were you looking for a suitcase? Because look over there, it's a suitcase. You can make out a locker. You can see a display.

There is an open gateway leading east. There is an open hatch leading north. There is an open door leading south.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in TextWorld to complete the game. The goal is to follow a specific sequence of actions: move south, open the gateway, go west, travel south again, open the passageway, go south, then west, north, and finally retrieve the poem from the bedchamber.

So far, the user has started by going south from the office to the studio. Then they opened the gateway and went west to the attic. Now, in the attic, they need to continue following the steps. The next step according to the initial instructions was to travel south after opening the gateway and going west. But in the current room (attic), there's a door leading south. So the next logical step would be to go south from the attic. 

Looking at the current room description, the attic has a door south, so moving south makes sense. The user needs to check if that's the correct direction. The previous steps were: go south (office to studio), open gateway, go west (studio to attic). Now, from the attic, moving south would be the next step as per the original plan. The user hasn't yet traveled south again after opening the gateway, so that's the next action. There's no loop here because each step leads to a new room. So the next command should be "go south".

You're now in the basement. Let's see what's in here.

You can make out a locked chest. You see a safe. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You make out a shelf. The shelf is normal. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is a closed passageway leading south. There is an open door leading north. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Now, the next step according to the initial instructions was to travel south again. But in the Basement, there's a closed passageway south, an open door north, and an exit west. The user tried "go south" again, which leads to the closed passageway. However, the next step in the goal is to open the passageway. So the user needs to open that passageway before proceeding further. The user's next action should be to open the passageway. But in the current prompt, the user hasn't done that yet.

The user started in the Office, went south to the Studio, opened the gateway west, went west to the Attic, then south to the Basement. Then they opened the passageway south. Now, the next step should be to go south through the passageway. But the user might have already done that. Wait, the original plan was after opening the passageway, attempt to go south.

Now, the next step according to the initial instructions was to attempt to go to the south again after opening the passageway. But in the Sauna, moving south leads back to the Basement, which might be a loop. However, the user needs to proceed towards the bedchamber.

Wait, the instructions say after opening the passageway, attempt to go south again. But in the Sauna, moving south is blocked? Or maybe the passageway is leading somewhere else. Wait, the Sauna has an open passageway north and an exit west. The user is in the Sauna, and the next step after opening the passageway (which was done in the Basement) would be to go south again. But in the Sauna, moving south would take you back to the Basement. However, the user needs to get to the bedchamber. Maybe the correct path is to go west from the Sauna, but the exit is unblocked. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go north from the Sauna through the open passageway to reach the next area.

Wait, the initial steps required after opening the passageway is to attempt to go south. But in the Sauna, moving south is not possible because the passageway is north. So perhaps the user is stuck here. The user needs to find a way to proceed towards the bedchamber. The next step might be to go west from the Sauna, which is an exit. But the exit is unblocked. However, the goal is to retrieve the poem from the bedchamber. So maybe the user needs to go north from the Sauna through the passageway to reach the next area, then proceed further.

But according to the initial instructions, after opening the passageway, the user should attempt to go south. However, in the current room (Sauna), moving south is not possible. Therefore, the user might be in a loop. The previous action was going south from the Basement to the Sauna. Now, the user needs to find another way. Maybe the correct next step is to go west from the Sauna, which is an exit. But the exit is unblocked. However, the user's goal is to reach the bedchamber. So perhaps the user needs to go north from the Sauna through the passageway to reach the next area, then proceed towards the bedchamber.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Basement again after going north from the Sauna. The previous steps have been: go south (from Office to Studio), open gateway, go west (to Attic), go south (to Basement), open passageway, go south (to Sauna), then go north back to Basement. Now, the next step according to the original plan was to go west, but the user is in the Basement again.

Now, the next step should be to go west from the Basement, as per the initial instructions. However, the user is in the Basement again, so maybe they need to check if they've already done that. But the current step is to go west from the Basement. However, in the Basement description, there's an exit to the west. So the next action should be to go west. But the user might be looping between Basement and Sauna. 

Wait, the user's last action was go north from Sauna to Basement. Now, in the Basement, the next step according to the original plan was to go west. But the user might have already done that. However, the instructions say after opening the passageway, go south, then west, then north, then retrieve the poem. So perhaps the current step is to go west from the Basement. But the user is in the Basement again, so maybe the next action is to go west. However, the user might be stuck in a loop between Basement and Sauna. But the user's last action was go north, leading back to Basement. So the next step should be to go west from the Basement. But the user needs to check if that's the correct next step. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go south again from the Basement. But according to the original plan, after opening the passageway, the user should go south, then west, then north. So perhaps the next step is to go west from the Basement. However, in the current state, the user is in the Basement, and the next step is to go west. But the user might have already done that.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in TextWorld to complete the game. The goal is to retrieve the poem from the bedchamber.

Looking at the current state: The user is in the Bedchamber, which has a poem on the floor. The previous steps involved moving through various rooms, opening gateways and passageways, and now they're here. The next step should be to pick up the poem. But the user's last action was going west, which led them to the Bedchamber. The prompt says to attempt to take the poem from the floor of the bedchamber. So the correct action here is to take the poem. However, the game might require using the command "take poem" or something similar. But in the previous steps, the user just moved around, so maybe the command is simply "take poem" or "get poem". Since the poem is on the floor, the correct action is to take it. The user needs to do that to win. So the next command should be "take poem".
