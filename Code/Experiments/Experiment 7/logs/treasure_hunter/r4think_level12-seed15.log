Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First thing I need you to do is to make an effort to travel south. If you can do that, attempt to go east. Then, retrieve the sandwich from the floor of the shower. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Lounge =-
Fancy seeing you here. Here, by the way, being the lounge. Let's see what's in here.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a bar. The bar is ordinary. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a couch. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The couch is typical. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You think about smashing the couch to bits, throwing the bits in the dump, etc, until you get bored. Look over there! a desk! Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is an unguarded exit to the east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

You can see an opened safe. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You make out a stand. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Lounge and Workshop. The goal is to retrieve the sandwich from the shower and then stop. But so far, the user has just been moving back and forth between north and south, which are the same rooms.

First, I need to check if the sandwich is in the shower. The initial description mentioned the lounge, workshop, bar, couch, desk, but no shower. Wait, the user's task says to retrieve the sandwich from the floor of the shower. But in the current rooms, there's no mention of a shower. Maybe the shower is in a different part of the map that's not yet explored.

But the user is stuck in a loop. The previous actions were going south and north repeatedly. The problem is that the user hasn't found the shower or the sandwich. So the next step is to look for the shower. But how? The current rooms don't mention a shower. Maybe the shower is in the workshop or lounge? Wait, the workshop has an opened safe and a stand, but nothing about a shower. The lounge has a bar, couch, desk. Maybe the user needs to check other directions, like east, which is unguarded. The user tried going east once, but the workshop's east exit is unguarded. Wait, in the workshop, there's an exit to the east. Maybe the shower is in that direction. But the user hasn't tried going east yet.

Wait, the initial instructions said to first travel south, then east. But the user kept going south and north, not east. So maybe the next step is to go east from the workshop. Let me check the previous steps. The user went south to workshop, then north back to lounge, then south again. So they haven't tried east yet. The workshop has an unguarded exit to the east. So maybe the shower is in that direction. The user needs to go east from the workshop. That's the next step. So the answer should be "go east".

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to retrieve the sandwich from the shower and then stop. So far, they've been moving between the Lounge and Workshop, which are the same rooms, creating a loop. They tried going east from the Workshop and ended up in the Bedchamber, but couldn't find the shower there. Then they went west back to the Lounge.

Now, the user is back in the Lounge, stuck again. The previous actions didn't find the shower, so they need to try a different approach. The next step should be to check other directions or look for clues about the shower. Since the Bedchamber didn't have the shower, maybe the shower is in another room. The user needs to explore other exits, like the north or east again. But since the Lounge has an exit to the east, maybe that's where the shower is. Alternatively, maybe the desk mentioned in the Lounge has the sandwich. Wait, the task says the sandwich is on the floor of the shower, not on the desk. So the user needs to find the shower first.

The user should try going east from the Lounge again. The Lounge has an unguarded exit to the east, which was previously leading to the Bedchamber. Maybe the shower is in a different room beyond that. Alternatively, maybe the safe in the Workshop has something, but it's empty. The user needs to explore all possible exits. The next action should be to go east again from the Lounge to check the next room.

Okay, let's see. The user's goal is to retrieve the sandwich from the shower and then stop. So far, they've been moving through different rooms: Lounge, Workshop, Bedchamber, Pantry, Studio. But they haven't found the shower or the sandwich yet.

In the current room, the Studio, there's a closed box. Maybe the sandwich is in there? But the user hasn't checked it. The previous actions involved moving between rooms without exploring items properly. The user needs to check the closed box in the Studio. If that's where the sandwich is, opening it would be the next step. But the task says the sandwich is in the shower, not the studio. So maybe the shower is in another room. The user hasn't found the shower yet, so they need to continue exploring. The next step is to check the closed box in the Studio.
