Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is how to play! First of all, you could, like, make an effort to head west. After that, head north. Following that, make an effort to take a trip east. Then, move north. After that, go to the west. And then, make an effort to move north. After that, head north. And then, attempt to venture east. Then, head south. Following that, attempt to move east. Then, make an attempt to take a trip south. After that, try to head south. And then, go to the south. With that over with, retrieve the shadfly from the floor of the laundromat. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Kitchenette =-
Well, here we are in the kitchenette.

A locked freezer is here. You can make out a fridge. The fridge is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You can make out a chair. The chair is usual. The chair appears to be empty. Hm. Oh well You make out a rack. The rack appears to be empty. Hopefully, this discovery doesn't ruin your TextWorld experience!

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a TextWorld game where they need to follow a specific sequence of movements to reach the shadfly in the laundromat. The initial instructions mention moving west, then north, east, north, west, north, east, south, east, south, and finally retrieve the shadfly.

Looking at the current environment, the user is in the Shower area. The previous action was "go west" from the Kitchenette, which led them to the Shower. The next step according to the initial instructions was to go north from the Shower. But the user hasn't done that yet. However, the user's last input was "go west" again, which might be part of a loop.

Wait, the user's current location is the Shower. The initial instructions said after moving west from the Kitchenette, they should go north. But in the current state, the user is in the Shower, and the exit to the east is unguarded. The user needs to go north from here. But the problem is that the user might be stuck in a loop if they keep going west again. So the next step should be to go north from the Shower. But the user's previous action was "go west", which might not be the correct next step. The user needs to check if they're following the correct sequence. The initial plan was: west, north, east, north, west, north, east, south, east, south, then get the shadfly. So after the Shower, the next step should be north. But the user is in the Shower, so going north would be the next step. However, the user might have already done that. Wait, the user's last action was "go west" from the Kitchenette to the Shower. Now, in the Shower, the next step according to the initial plan is to go north. So the correct next action is "go north".

-= Cookery =-
You arrive in a cookery. An usual kind of place.

You smell a great smell, and follow it to a case. You see a refrigerator. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this?

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through TextWorld to win by following a specific path. The goal is to retrieve the shadfly from the laundromat's floor and then win.

First, I need to recap the game's objective step by step. The initial instructions mention moving west, then north, east, north again, west, north, east, south, east, south, then south again to get the shadfly. But the user has already moved through some areas: from the Kitchenette to the Shower, then to the Cookery. 

Looking at the current location, the user is in the Cookery. The previous actions were go west (from Kitchenette to Shower), then go north (from Shower to Cookery). Now, the next step according to the initial plan was to go east, but in the Cookery, the options are east or north or south. The user needs to proceed towards the laundromat, which is likely in the south direction based on the initial steps. However, the initial plan had a step to go south after moving east. But the user is in the Cookery, and the exit to the south is unblocked. So maybe the next step is to go south from Cookery to reach the laundromat. But the user needs to check if that's the correct path. Alternatively, maybe the laundromat is in the east direction. Wait, the initial steps said after moving east, then north, then west, etc. But the user is now in Cookery, which is a different area. Maybe the correct path is to go south from Cookery to reach the laundromat. However, the user needs to make sure they're following the correct sequence. Since the initial plan had to go south after certain steps, perhaps the next action is to go south here. But the user needs to avoid loops. Since the previous actions were moving west, north, and now in Cookery, the next step should be to go south to proceed towards the laundromat. So the next command would be go south.

Okay, let's try to figure out the best way to proceed here. The user is in a TextWorld game, and the goal is to retrieve the shadfly from the laundromat and win. The previous steps have led the user back to the Shower area, which seems like a loop.

First, I need to recap the game's objective. The user needs to navigate through different areas, collect the shadfly, and place it in the correct location. The initial instructions mentioned moving west, north, east, etc., but the user has been stuck in a loop between the Shower and Cookery areas.

Looking at the current location, the user is in the Shower again. The previous action was going south from Cookery, which brought them back to the Shower. The exits here are east and north. The user has already tried going west and north before, which might be why they're looping.

The next step should be to avoid repeating the same actions. Since going north from the Shower was tried before, maybe trying east instead. But the exit to the east is unguarded, so that's a possibility. Alternatively, maybe there's another way to proceed. The user needs to break the loop by trying a different direction or action.

Wait, the initial instructions said to go west, then north, east, north, west, north, east, south, east, south, south, and then retrieve the shadfly. But the user hasn't reached the laundromat yet. Maybe the correct path is to keep moving east from the Shower to reach the laundromat. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to find the shadfly in the laundromat, which is part of the kitchenette or another area.

But the current location is the Shower, so the next logical step is to go east to continue moving towards the laundromat. The user should try going east instead of north again to avoid the loop. So the next action would be "go east".

Okay, let's try to figure out the best way to proceed here. The user is in a TextWorld game where the goal is to retrieve the shadfly from the laundromat and win. The previous steps have led them back to the Kitchenette, which they've already been in before.

Looking at the history, the user has been moving between rooms: starting in the Kitchenette, then the Shower, Cookery, back to Shower, then Kitchenette again. It seems like they're stuck in a loop between these areas. The instructions mentioned specific directions to follow, but maybe they're not following them correctly.

The current room is the Kitchenette again. The exit to the east is unblocked, and they're told to try going west. But since they've been looping here, maybe they need to try a different direction. The problem is that the previous actions have not led them closer to the laundromat or the shadfly. 

The user's past actions include going west, north, east, south, and back. The next step should be to break the loop. Since the Kitchenette has a locked freezer, a fridge (empty), a chair, and a rack, maybe there's something there. But the goal is to find the shadfly, which is in the laundromat. So perhaps they need to find the correct path to the laundromat.

Wait, the initial instructions said to go west, then north, east, north, west, north, east, south, east, south, south, then retrieve the shadfly. But maybe the user is not following those steps correctly. Alternatively, maybe they need to find the laundromat directly.

Since the user is in the Kitchenette again, maybe they need to go east to the exit, then follow the path to the laundromat. But the previous steps have them looping, so perhaps they need to try a different direction. The exit to the east is unblocked, so going east from Kitchenette might be the way to go. But they've already done that before. However, maybe the laundromat is accessible from there.

Alternatively, maybe they need to check the freezer or other items in the Kitchenette for clues. But the fridge is empty, and the rack is empty. The chair is usual and empty. So maybe there's nothing there. Therefore, the next step is to go east again, but since that's where they came from, maybe they need to go west again. But that's the same as before.

Wait, the user's last action was going west from the Shower to Kitchenette. Now, in Kitchenette, the exit to the east is unblocked, and they should try going west again. But that would take them back to the Shower. However, the initial goal was to go west, then north, etc. Maybe the correct path is to go east from Kitchenette to the exit, then proceed to the next room, which might be the laundromat.

But the user is stuck in a loop, so they need to find a different action. The previous steps didn't help, so maybe they need to try a different direction. However, in the Kitchenette, the only exits mentioned are east and west. Since going west leads back to the Shower, and east is unblocked, maybe they should go east again. But that's what they did before. However, perhaps the laundromat is accessible from the east exit.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to look for the shadfly in the current room. But the description says the rack is empty, fridge is empty, chair is empty. So maybe the shadfly is not here. Therefore, the next step is to go east to the exit and proceed further.

But the user is in a loop, so they need to break it. The previous actions of going west and east have not led them to the laundromat. Therefore, maybe they need to try a different direction, but in the Kitchenette, the only directions are west and east. So perhaps the correct next step is to go east again, even though they've done that before, but maybe that's the way to the laundromat.

-= Laundromat =-
You arrive in a laundromat. A standard one. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."



There is an unblocked exit to the north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

There is a shadfly on the floor.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in TextWorld to win the game. The goal is to retrieve the shadfly from the laundromat and put it in the correct place. 

Looking at the history, the player has moved through several rooms: Kitchenette, Shower, Cookery, back to Shower, then Kitchenette again, and now they're in the Laundromat. The current room has a shadfly on the floor.

The user's previous actions were moving east and west between rooms. Now, in the Laundromat, the shadfly is present. The next step should be to pick up the shadfly. But the instruction says to retrieve it from the floor, so the command should be "take shadfly".

Wait, but the game's goal mentions putting it in a place. However, the user's final instruction in the last prompt was to retrieve the shadfly from the floor of the laundromat. So once picked up, maybe that's the winning condition. So the correct action here is to take the shadfly. The previous steps have led them to this room, so now they need to pick it up. The answer should be "take shadfly".
