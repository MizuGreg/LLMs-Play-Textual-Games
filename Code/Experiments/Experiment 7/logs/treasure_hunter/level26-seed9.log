THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The user wants me to figure out the next step in the game. The goal is to recover the paper towel from the safe in the sauna. So far, the user has navigated through various rooms, ending up in the sauna where the safe is located. The safe is opened and contains the paper towel. The next logical step is to take the paper towel from the safe.

Wait, the current room is the sauna, and the safe is there. The user needs to interact with the safe. The previous actions have led them to the correct location. The next command should be to take the paper towel from the safe. But the game might require using the exact phrase. Let me check the previous interactions. The user was told that the safe contains a paper towel. So the correct action is to take the paper towel. The command should be "take paper towel" or "take the paper towel". But in the game's context, maybe it's "take paper towel" without the article. Let me confirm. The user is in the sauna, and the safe is opened. So the correct action is to take the paper towel from the safe. The next step is to execute that command.
</think>take paper towel
