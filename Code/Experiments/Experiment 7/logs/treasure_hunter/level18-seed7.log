Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First, it would be fantastic if you could ensure that the passageway is open. After that, head south. After that, attempt to travel south. Then, head east. Next, attempt to go north. After that, venture north. Then, make an attempt to head east. After that, take the latchkey from the pan. Alright, thanks!

-= Dish-Pit =-
Well I'll be, you are in a place we're calling a dish-pit. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.



There is a closed passageway leading south. There is an open door leading north. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Cookhouse =-
Wow! You're in a cookhouse. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You make out a pan. The pan is ordinary. On the pan you see a latchkey. You scan the room, seeing a bowl. However, the bowl, like an empty bowl, has nothing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the bowl.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.
