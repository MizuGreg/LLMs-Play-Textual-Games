Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, make sure that the portal inside the cellar is open. After that, make an effort to move south. Then, move west. Then, make an attempt to go to the north. Once you succeed at that, head west. And then, pick-up the peanut from the floor of the studio. Got that? Good!

-= Cellar =-
I am pleased to announce that you are now in the cellar.



There is a closed portal leading south. There is an open hatch leading north.
