It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First of all, you could, like, make an attempt to head west. And then, go north. With that accomplished, move west. Then, pick-up the peanut from the floor of the studio. Alright, thanks!

-= Kitchenette =-
Well, here we are in a kitchenette.



There is an open portal leading north. There is an open passageway leading west.

-= Cubicle =-
Guess what, you are in the place we're calling the cubicle. You begin looking for stuff.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a safe. You can see a closed locker. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a desk. But the thing is empty.

There is an open passageway leading east. There is an open gateway leading north. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

Well how about that, you are in a place we're calling a steam room. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.



There is an open gateway leading south. There is an open door leading west.

-= Studio =-
You arrive in a studio. A standard one.



There is an open door leading east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked.

There is a peanut on the floor.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in the Studio, and there's a peanut on the floor. The goal mentioned earlier was to pick up the peanut from the studio floor. So the first step is to confirm the goal: pick up the peanut.

Looking back at the previous actions: they went west from the Kitchenette, then north to the Cubicle, then west again to the Steam Room, and now west again to the Studio. So the steps taken so far are moving through the rooms, and now they're in the Studio where the peanut is. The next step should be to pick up the peanut.

Wait, the user's last action was "go west" to reach the Studio. Now, in the Studio, the peanut is on the floor. So the next command should be to pick up the peanut. The previous actions didn't involve picking up anything, so no loop here. Just need to pick up the peanut. The answer should be "take peanut" or "pick up peanut". The game might expect "take" or "get". Let me check the previous commands. The user was told to "pick-up the peanut from the floor of the studio." So the correct command is "pick up peanut" or "take peanut". The system might accept either, but since the instruction said "pick-up", maybe "pick up" is better. But the user's previous actions used "go west", so maybe "take peanut" is the right command here.
</think>take peanut
