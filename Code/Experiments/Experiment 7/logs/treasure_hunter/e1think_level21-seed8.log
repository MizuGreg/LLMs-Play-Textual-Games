Welcome to TextWorld! First, it would be good if you could take a trip west. If you can accomplish that, try to move south. Then, retrieve the spork from the floor of the cookery. That's it!

-= Cubicle =-
You are in a cubicle. A normal kind of place.

You can make out a coffer. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. What's that over there? It looks like it's a desk. The desk is normal. However, the desk, like an empty desk, has nothing on it.

There is an open gate leading north. There is an open portal leading west. There is an unguarded exit to the east. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

-= Study =-
You're now in the study.

You make out a closed toolbox in the corner. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a locker. You see a mantle. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's an armchair. The armchair is normal. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open portal leading east. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and collect items. The goal mentioned is to first go west, then south, and retrieve the spork from the cookery area.

Looking at the current environment, the user is in the Study. The Study has a closed toolbox, an armchair, a mantle, an open portal east, and an exit to the south. The previous action was "go west", which led them here from the Cubicle. 

The next step according to the initial instructions was to move south. The Study's exit to the south is unguarded, so that's doable. After moving south, they would enter the next room, which might be the Cookery area where the spork is located. 

But wait, the user hasn't moved south yet. The current room is the Study, and the exit to the south is available. So the next logical step is to go south. Once there, they can check the cookery area for the spork. 

I need to make sure not to repeat actions. The user already went west, so moving south is the next step. There's no loop here because each room is new. So the correct next action is to go south.
</think>go south

-= Cookery =-
You find yourself in a cookery. A typical kind of place.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked.

There is a spork on the floor.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Cookery room. The goal is to retrieve the spork from the floor. The previous steps were going west to the Study, then south to the Cookery. Now, in the Cookery, there's a spork on the floor. So the next step is to pick up the spork. The command should be "take spork" or something similar. But the user's last action was "go south", which led them here. Since the spork is on the floor, the immediate action is to take it. I need to make sure that the next command is correct. The answer should be "take spork".
</think>take spork
