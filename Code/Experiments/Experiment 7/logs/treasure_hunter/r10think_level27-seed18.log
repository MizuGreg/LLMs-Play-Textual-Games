Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, you could, like, attempt to travel south. And then, make an effort to take a trip east. And then, make an attempt to move east. Following that, open the oak door in the closet. Then, make an effort to go to the north. And then, make an effort to move west. After that, lift the fresh laundry scented key from the floor of the shower. With the fresh laundry scented key, insert the fresh laundry scented key into the fresh laundry scented door in the shower's lock to unlock it. And then, ensure that the fresh laundry scented door inside the shower is open. After that, travel north. Then, attempt to move east. After that, open the portal. Then, attempt to head north. Then, pick-up the latchkey from the floor of the cubicle. Got that? Good!

-= Laundromat =-
You arrive in a laundromat. An ordinary one. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You can see a rack. The rack is normal. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a counter. You shudder, but continue examining the counter. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is an unblocked exit to the south.

You are in a sauna. An ordinary one. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a board. The board is usual. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

There is an open door leading east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate a TextWorld game based on a laundromat. The initial instructions were to go south, then east, open the oak door in the closet, go north, west, pick up the key from the shower, unlock the door, go north again, east, open the portal, north, and pick up the latchkey from the cubicle.

But when the user tried to go east from the laundromat, it kept saying "You can't go that way." So maybe the path isn't straightforward. Let me check the previous steps again. The user first went south to the sauna, then north back to the laundromat. Now they're stuck trying to go east, which isn't possible. 

Wait, maybe the correct path isn't just moving in the directions mentioned. The user might need to find another way to reach the closet or the shower. The problem is that the laundromat's east exit is blocked. So perhaps the user needs to look for other objects or actions that can help progress. For example, maybe there's a door or a key they can use to open something else. 

Looking back at the initial description, there's a rack and a counter, but nothing on them. The user was supposed to pick up the key from the shower, but they haven't reached the shower yet. Maybe the key is in the shower, but to get there, they need to open the door. However, the user is stuck in the laundromat. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to find a different route. Since going east from the laundromat isn't possible, perhaps there's another exit or a hidden path. The user might need to check other directions, like north again, but that's where they came from. Or maybe there's a door they can open in the laundromat that leads to another area. 

Wait, the initial instructions mentioned opening the oak door in the closet. Maybe the closet is in the laundromat. The user hasn't tried opening that door yet. So perhaps the next step is to look for a closet or a door in the laundromat that can be opened. If the oak door is in the closet, maybe that's the way to proceed. 

So the user is stuck trying to go east, which isn't possible. The next step should be to check the closet for the oak door. If that's the case, then the user should try to open the oak door in the closet. That would be the next action instead of trying to go east again.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is stuck in the Laundromat, trying to follow a series of steps but can't proceed. The initial goal was to navigate through various rooms, pick up keys, and open doors. But the user is repeatedly trying to go east from the Laundromat, which isn't possible. They've tried looking for a closet, door, key, rack, counter, but nothing is found.

First step: The main goal is to follow the instructions given, which include moving in specific directions and interacting with objects. The user needs to reach the shower, pick up the key, unlock the door, and then proceed to the portal and cubicle.

Second step: The user has already gone south to the Sauna, then north back to the Laundromat. They tried going east multiple times but couldn't. Now they're stuck trying to find objects like the oak door in the closet or the key. But since those aren't visible, maybe the approach is wrong.

Third step: The user is in a loop, repeatedly trying to go east and look for things that aren't there. The problem is that the Laundromat doesn't have an east exit, so the initial instruction to go east might be incorrect. Maybe the correct path is to find another way, like using the sauna's east door. Wait, in the Sauna, there's an open door east. Maybe the user should go east from the Sauna instead of the Laundromat. But the user was told to go south first, then east. Maybe the sequence is off. Alternatively, the user might need to check the Sauna's east door first.

So the next action should be to go east from the Sauna, which is possible. That would be the correct step instead of trying to go east from the Laundromat, which is blocked. Therefore, the next command is to go east.

-= Sauna =-
You are in a sauna. An ordinary one. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a board. The board is usual. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

There is an open door leading east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's try to figure out what's going on here. The user is stuck in a loop between the Laundromat and the Sauna, repeatedly trying to go east from the Laundromat, which isn't possible. The initial goal was to follow a series of steps: go south, east, open the oak door, go north, west, pick up the key, unlock the door, go north, east, open the portal, north, and pick up the latchkey.

But the user is stuck in a loop because the Laundromat doesn't have an east exit. The Sauna has an east door, but the user hasn't used that. Maybe the correct path is to go east from the Sauna instead of the Laundromat. However, the user was told to go south first, then east. But since going east from the Laundromat isn't possible, maybe the sequence is wrong. The user needs to find another way to reach the shower or the closet where the key is. Alternatively, maybe the oak door in the closet is in the Sauna. But the user hasn't checked that yet. The next step should be to explore the Sauna's east door instead of trying to go east from the Laundromat. So the correct action is to go east from the Sauna.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Laundromat and Sauna. The goal is to follow specific steps: go south, east, open the oak door, etc. But the user can't go east from the Laundromat. They tried going east from the Sauna and ended up in the Cookhouse, then back to Sauna. Now they're back in Laundromat again.

First step: The main goal is to navigate through the rooms, pick up keys, and open doors. The user needs to reach the shower to get the key, then unlock the door, proceed to the portal, and pick up the latchkey.

Second step: The user has tried going east from Laundromat multiple times, which isn't possible. They went to Sauna, then east to Cookhouse, then west back to Sauna. Now back in Laundromat. They need to find another way, maybe check the Sauna's north exit or look for objects there.

Third step: The loop is between Laundromat and Sauna. The user needs to break this by exploring the Sauna's north door instead of trying east again. The correct action is to go north from Sauna, which was mentioned as unguarded. That might lead to another area where the key is located.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Laundromat and Sauna. They keep trying to go east from the Laundromat, which isn't possible. The goal is to follow specific steps: go south, east, open the oak door, etc. But the user can't proceed because the Laundromat doesn't have an east exit. They tried going east from the Sauna, which led to the Cookhouse, but that didn't help. Now they're back in the Laundromat again.

First step: The main goal is to navigate through the rooms, pick up keys, and open doors. The user needs to reach the shower to get the key, then unlock the door, proceed to the portal, and pick up the latchkey.

Second step: The user has tried going east from Laundromat multiple times, which isn't possible. They went to Sauna, then east to Cookhouse, then west back to Sauna. Now back in Laundromat. They need to find another way, maybe check the Sauna's north exit or look for objects there.

Third step: The loop is between Laundromat and Sauna. The user needs to break this by exploring the Sauna's north door instead of trying east again. The correct action is to go north from Sauna, which was mentioned as unguarded. That might lead to another area where the key is located.
