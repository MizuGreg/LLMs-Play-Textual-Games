It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First thing I need you to do is to try to head east. And then, head north. With that accomplished, travel north. And then, move north. And then, go west. That done, try to move south. With that done, try to go to the south. With that done, attempt to go west. And then, attempt to go west. Then, travel west. After that, pick-up the key from the floor of the canteen. And once you've done that, you win!

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user wants me to figure out the next action in this TextWorld game. The goal is to pick up the key from the canteen and then win. Let me recap the steps they've taken so far.

First, they started in the cellar, went east to the vault, then west back to the cellar, east again to the vault, then north to the cookery. Then they went south back to the cookery. Hmm, so they've been moving between cellar, vault, and cookery. The instructions mentioned after going west again, they need to go south, then west again, then west again, then pick up the key.

Wait, the user's last action was going south from the cookery back to the cookery. So they're stuck in a loop between cookery and cellar? Because when they were in the cookery, the options were south (which led back to cookery) and north (to the garage). But they tried going south again, which just loops back. So maybe they need to find another path. 

Wait, the original instructions said after going west, then south, then west, then west, then pick up the key. But maybe the key is in the canteen, which is a different location. The user hasn't reached the canteen yet. So perhaps they need to find a way to get to the canteen. 

Looking at the current location: they're in the cookery. The options are south (which is the same place), north to the garage, and west. Wait, in the cookery, the description says there's an unblocked exit to the west. So maybe going west from the cookery would take them to another area. Let me check the previous steps. 

Earlier, when they were in the cookery, they tried going south (which was the same place) and then north to the garage. But maybe the west exit from the cookery is the key. Wait, the user's last action was going south, which brought them back to cookery. So maybe they need to go west from the cookery now. Let me check the previous steps again. 

In the cookery, the description says: "There is an open door leading south. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. There is an unblocked exit to the west." So the west exit is available. So the next step should be to go west from the cookery. That would take them to another room, maybe the canteen? Because the key is in the canteen. 

So the user's next action should be "go west" from the cookery. That's the next step after being stuck in the loop. They need to break the loop by trying a different direction. So the correct command is "go west".

-= Attic =-
You find yourself in an attic. An usual one.

Were you looking for a coffer? Because look over there, it's a coffer. Now why would someone leave that there? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a toolbox.

There is an unguarded exit to the east. There is an unguarded exit to the north. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to pick up the key from the canteen and then win. So far, they've been moving through various rooms like the cellar, vault, cookery, attic, laundry place, and launderette. They've tried going east, west, north, south, but haven't found the canteen yet.

Looking at the current location, the user is in the launderette. The exits here are west, east, north, and south. The previous steps involved moving between these rooms, but they've been stuck in a loop between the attic and laundry place. The key is in the canteen, which hasn't been reached yet.

The user needs to find a path to the canteen. Since the canteen was mentioned in the initial instructions, maybe it's in a different part of the map. The user has to avoid looping and find a new direction. The previous actions didn't lead to the canteen, so they need to try a different approach. Maybe going east from the launderette could lead them closer to the canteen. Alternatively, checking the north exit might be necessary. But since the user is in the launderette, the next step should be to go east to explore that direction, as that's the unblocked exit mentioned. So the next action is "go east".

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through TextWorld to pick up the key from the canteen and win. They've been moving between the garage, cookery, and other rooms, but they haven't found the canteen yet. The key steps from the initial instructions were to go east, north, north, west, south, south, west, west, then pick up the key. But the user is stuck in a loop between the garage and cookery.

Looking at the current location, they're in the cookery. The exits are south, north, and west. The previous actions have led them back and forth between these rooms. The canteen hasn't been reached yet. The user needs to break the loop. Since going south and north keeps them stuck, maybe they need to try the west exit from the cookery. But earlier attempts to go west led them to the garage. Wait, maybe the canteen is in a different direction. Alternatively, maybe they need to find another path. The next step should be to go west from the cookery to see if that leads them to the canteen or another area.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to pick up the key from the canteen and win. So far, they've been moving between the attic, laundry place, and other rooms, but haven't found the canteen yet. The key steps from the initial instructions were to go east, north, north, west, south, south, west, west, then pick up the key. But the user is stuck in a loop between the garage and cookery.

Looking at the current location, they're in the laundry place. The exits are east, north, south, and west. The previous actions have led them in a loop between the attic and laundry place. They need to find a way to get to the canteen without looping. The next step should be to go east from the laundry place to explore that direction, as that's the unblocked exit mentioned.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the garage and cookery. They've been going back and forth between these two rooms repeatedly. The goal is to pick up the key from the canteen. So far, they haven't reached the canteen yet. The previous steps didn't lead them closer, so they need to find a different path.

Looking at the current location, they're in the cookery. The exits are south, north, and west. The user has tried going north and south, which just loops them back. The west exit might be the key. Earlier, when they were in the cookery, going west led them to the garage. But maybe from the garage, there's another exit. The garage has an unblocked exit to the north and a west exit. Wait, maybe the canteen is in a different direction. Alternatively, maybe they need to check the north exit from the garage. But the user has been stuck in the loop, so they need to try a different action. Since going west from the cookery led them to the garage, perhaps they need to go west again from the garage. But the user has already tried that. Maybe they need to go east from the cookery instead of north or south. But the cookery's description says there's an unblocked exit to the west. Hmm. The user needs to break the loop by trying a new direction. The next step should be to go west from the cookery to see if that leads them to the canteen or another area.

There is an unguarded exit to the east. There is an unguarded exit to the north. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Were you looking for a coffer? Because look over there, it's a coffer. Now why would someone leave that there? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a toolbox.

There is an unguarded exit to the east. There is an unguarded exit to the north. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.
