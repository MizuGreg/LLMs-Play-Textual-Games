I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is how to play! First step, take a trip west. And then, head north. That done, venture north. And then, lift the loaf of bread from the floor of the launderette. Alright, thanks!

-= Chamber =-
You've just sauntered into a chamber.

You can see a desk. The desk is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open portal leading north. There is an open gate leading south. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and interact with objects. The goal mentioned earlier was to go west, then north, then north again, and finally lift the loaf of bread from the launderette.

Looking at the current room, they're back in the Playroom after going south from the Basement. The previous steps were: go west (from Chamber to Playroom), go north (to Basement), go south (back to Playroom). Now, they're stuck in a loop between Playroom and Basement. The next step should be to go east from the Playroom, as the hint says to try going east. But since the user is in the Playroom again, maybe they need to go east to proceed further. The key is to break the loop by trying a different direction. The next action should be "go east" to move forward and avoid repeating the same steps.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Playroom and Chamber. The goal was to go west, then north, then north again, and lift the bread. But they keep cycling between the rooms.

First, the goal is to reach the launderette and lift the bread. So far, they've been moving west and east, which isn't getting them closer. The next step should be to find the bread, but they haven't found any objects yet.

Second, their past actions have only been moving between rooms without discovering items. The next step should be to look for the bread instead of moving again.

Third, they're in a loop, so they need to try a different action. Instead of moving, they should check the desk in the Chamber for the bread. The desk was mentioned as being usual but maybe has the loaf.

Finally, the next action is to look at the desk to find the bread.

First, the goal is to reach the launderette and pick up the bread. So far, the user has been moving west and east, which isn't getting them closer. They need to find a way to get to the launderette.

Second, the past actions have only been moving between rooms without discovering any objects. The next step should be to look for the bread directly instead of moving again.

Third, the user is in a loop, so they need to try a different action. Instead of moving, they should check the desk in the Chamber for the bread. The desk was mentioned as being usual but maybe has the loaf.

Finally, the next action is to look at the desk to find the bread.

FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's tackle this. The user is stuck in a loop between the Playroom and Chamber, trying to find the loaf of bread. The goal is to lift the bread from the launderette. So far, they've been moving west and east, which isn't getting them closer. They need to find a way to get to the launderette.

First, the goal is to reach the launderette and pick up the bread. So far, the user has been moving between rooms without discovering any objects. The next step should be to look for the bread directly instead of moving again.

Second, the past actions have only been moving between rooms without discovering any objects. The next step should be to check the desk in the Chamber again, maybe the bread is there.

Third, the user is in a loop, so they need to try a different action. Instead of moving, they should check the desk in the Chamber for the bread. The desk was mentioned as being usual but maybe has the loaf.

Finally, the next action is to look at the desk to find the bread.

FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is stuck in a loop between the Playroom and Chamber, trying to find the loaf of bread. The goal is to lift the bread from the launderette. So far, they've been moving west and east, which isn't getting them closer. They need to find a way to get to the launderette.

First, the goal is to reach the launderette and pick up the bread. So far, the user has been moving between rooms without discovering any objects. The next step should be to look for the bread directly instead of moving again.

Second, the past actions have only been moving between rooms without discovering any objects. The next step should be to check the desk in the Chamber again, maybe the bread is there.

Third, the user is in a loop, so they need to try a different action. Instead of moving, they should check the desk in the Chamber for the bread. The desk was mentioned as being usual but maybe has the loaf.

Finally, the next action is to look at the desk to find the bread.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is stuck in a loop between the Playroom and Chamber, trying to find the loaf of bread. The goal is to lift the bread from the launderette. So far, they've been moving west and east, which isn't getting them closer. They need to find a way to get to the launderette.

First, the goal is to reach the launderette and pick up the bread. So far, the user has been moving between rooms without discovering any objects. The next step should be to look for the bread directly instead of moving again.

Second, the past actions have only been moving between rooms without discovering any objects. The next step should be to check the desk in the Chamber again, maybe the bread is there.

Third, the user is in a loop, so they need to try a different action. Instead of moving, they should check the desk in the Chamber for the bread. The desk was mentioned as being usual but maybe has the loaf.

Finally, the next action is to look at the desk to find the bread.
