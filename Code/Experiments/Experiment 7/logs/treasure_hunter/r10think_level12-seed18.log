Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an profound round of TextWorld? You do! First step, go west. Then, take a trip south. And then, lift the latchkey from the floor of the closet. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Bathroom =-
You've come into a typical room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be typical. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the bathroom.

You make out a cabinet. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a drawer. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a trunk.

There is an open passageway leading south. There is an open walnut gate leading west.

go west
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Office =-
You've just sauntered into an office.



There is an open walnut gate leading east. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go south
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Closet =-
You find yourself in a closet. An ordinary one. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You see a stand. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north.

There is a latchkey on the floor.

That's not a verb I recognise.
