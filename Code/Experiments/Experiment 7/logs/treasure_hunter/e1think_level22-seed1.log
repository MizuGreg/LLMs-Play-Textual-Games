Welcome to another exciting session of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to make an attempt to venture south. After that, attempt to take a trip south. And then, attempt to take a trip east. With that over with, make an effort to go to the east. And then, lift the keycard from the floor of the workshop. Alright, thanks!

-= Shower =-
You are in a shower. A standard kind of place.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

-= Studio =-
You've just shown up in a studio.



There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

There is a legume on the floor.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and find a keycard. The initial steps mentioned were to go south from the shower, then south again from the studio, then east, and finally lift the keycard from the workshop.

First, the current location is the Studio. The user has already gone south from the shower, which led them to the studio. The next steps according to the original instructions were to go south again, then east, and then lift the keycard. But in the studio, the available exits are north, west, and south. The user is told to try going south again, but the studio's description says the exit to the south is unblocked. However, the user might be stuck in a loop if they keep going back and forth.

Looking at the previous steps: the user first went south from the shower, then from the studio, which might have led them back to the shower or another room. Wait, the initial prompt said after going south from the shower, they ended up in the studio. Then, the next step was to go south again from the studio. But the studio's description mentions an exit to the north and west, and south. However, the user might be in a loop between the shower and studio. The keycard is in the workshop, so they need to get there.

The user's next action should be to go south from the studio to reach the next room. But if that's not working, maybe they need to go west instead. However, the original plan was to go south, then east. So perhaps after the studio, going south leads to another room, then east from there. But the user needs to check the available exits again. The studio has a legume on the floor, which might be a clue, but the main goal is to find the keycard in the workshop.

So the next step is to go south from the studio. If that's not possible, maybe go west. But according to the initial instructions, the user should try going south again. However, if that's leading to a loop, they need to find another way. But the user's last action was going south from the shower, then to the studio. Now, from the studio, the next step is to go south again. If that's not working, maybe go west. But the user needs to follow the original plan: go south, then south again, then east, then east again to reach the workshop. Then lift the keycard.

So the next action is to go south from the studio. If that's not possible, maybe go west. But the user's instructions say to attempt to take a trip south again. So the next command should be "go south".

-= Cubicle =-
You are in a cubicle. An usual kind of place.



There is an open wooden passageway leading east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and eventually lift the keycard from the workshop. Let me break down the current situation.

First, the goal is to venture south, then take a trip south again, then east, then go east again, and finally lift the keycard. But the user has already gone south from the shower to the studio, then south again to the cubicle. Now, in the cubicle, the options are east, north, or west. The previous actions were going south twice, but the user needs to go east next. The cubicle has an open passage east, so the next step should be to go east. The user might be stuck in a loop if they keep going south, but since there's an east exit, moving east makes sense. The keycard is in the workshop, so after moving east, they need to find the workshop and pick up the keycard. The next command should be "go east".

You've just walked into a laundromat.



There is an open wooden gateway leading east. There is an open wooden passageway leading west.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing a text adventure game, and their goal is to lift the keycard from the workshop floor. Let me break down the steps they've taken so far.

First, they started in the shower, went south to the studio. Then from the studio, they went south again to the cubicle. From the cubicle, they went east to the laundromat. Now, they're in the laundromat, which has a west and east passage. The next step mentioned in the initial instructions was to go east again, but they already did that. Wait, the user's previous action was "go east" from the cubicle, leading to the laundromat. Now, in the laundromat, the next step would be to check if they can proceed further. The instructions said after going east, they need to lift the keycard from the workshop. But the laundromat's description doesn't mention the workshop yet. Maybe they need to go west from the laundromat back to the cubicle, then continue east again? Or perhaps there's a different path. Wait, the initial task was to go south, then south again, then east, then east again. But the user has already done some of those steps. Wait, the original task was: venture south, then take a trip south, then east, then east again, then lift the keycard. But the user's path so far is shower -> studio -> cubicle -> laundromat. Maybe they need to go west from the laundromat back to the cubicle, then east again to reach the workshop? Or maybe the workshop is in a different direction. The keycard is in the workshop's floor, so they need to get to the workshop. The laundromat's east and west passages might lead to other areas. The user needs to find the workshop. Since the laundromat has a west and east exit, perhaps going west back to the cubicle, then north to the studio, then west to the shower? But that seems like a loop. Alternatively, maybe from the laundromat, going east again would lead to another area. But the user's previous action was "go east" from the cubicle to the laundromat. Now, in the laundromat, the next step is to check if there's a way to the workshop. Since the keycard is in the workshop, they need to reach there. The user might need to go west from the laundromat back to the cubicle, then north to the studio, then west to the shower, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe the workshop is east of the laundromat. But the laundromat's east passage is described as an open wooden gateway. Maybe that leads to the workshop. Wait, the user's initial task was to go south, then south again, then east, then east again. But they've already done some of those steps. Maybe they need to go east from the laundromat to reach the workshop. But the laundromat's east is a gateway, so perhaps that's the way. But the user hasn't checked that yet. So the next action should be to go east from the laundromat. However, the user's previous action was "go east" from the cubicle, leading to the laundromat. Now, in the laundromat, going east again might be the next step. But the user's last command was "go east" from the cubicle. Wait, the current location is the laundromat. The user needs to proceed east from here. But the initial instructions said after going east, they need to lift the keycard. However, the laundromat's description doesn't mention the workshop yet. So maybe the user needs to go east from the laundromat to reach the workshop. Therefore, the next action is "go east".

-= Workshop =-
You are in a workshop. A standard kind of place. The room is well lit.



There is an open stone gate leading east. There is an open wooden gateway leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked.

There is a keycard on the floor.

Okay, let's see. The user's goal is to lift the keycard from the floor of the workshop. So far, they've navigated through the shower, studio, cubicle, and laundromat, finally reaching the workshop. The current room is the workshop, and there's a keycard on the floor.

The previous actions were going south, then south again, then east, and then east again. Now they're in the workshop. The next step should be to pick up the keycard. But the user's last action was "go east", which might have been part of moving towards the workshop. Now that they're in the workshop, the keycard is here, so the next action should be to take the keycard. But the game might require using the correct command, like "take keycard" or "get keycard". However, the user's previous commands were all "go" directions. Maybe the correct command here is to pick up the keycard. But the system message says to output the command as a short command, so maybe "take keycard" is the right move. But I need to check if the keycard is on the floor, which it is. So the next action is to take the keycard.
