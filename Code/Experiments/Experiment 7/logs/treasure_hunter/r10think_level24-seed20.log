Welcome to another life changing round of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First thing I need you to do is to try to travel east. And then, travel east. With that done, open the hatch. And then, attempt to take a trip east. Following that, go to the north. Then, move west. After that, make an attempt to travel west. And then, make an attempt to venture north. Okay, and then, recover the loaf of bread from the counter inside the pantry. And once you've done that, you win!

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text-based game where they need to follow a series of movements and actions to win. The goal is to recover the loaf of bread from the pantry and then win.

First, I need to recall the steps mentioned in the initial task. The user was told to travel east twice, open a hatch, then go north, west, west, north, etc., and finally get the bread from the pantry.

Looking at the current location, the user is in the Garage. The previous steps have involved moving through various rooms: Bar → Playroom → Chamber → Studio → Washroom → Salon → Study → Shower → Garage. The next step according to the initial instructions was to go north from the Shower, which led to the Garage. Now, in the Garage, the user needs to find the pantry and get the bread.

But the current room is the Garage. The user hasn't yet reached the pantry. The initial steps might have required moving through specific directions. Let me check the path again. After the Shower, the user went north to the Garage. From the Garage, the exits are east, south, west. The user needs to find the pantry. Maybe the pantry is in one of these directions. However, the user hasn't checked those yet.

Wait, the initial instructions said to "recover the loaf of bread from the counter inside the pantry." So the user needs to find the pantry, open it, and take the bread. But in the current room (Garage), the exits are east, south, west. The user hasn't checked those yet. So the next step would be to explore one of those directions. Let's see: the user is in the Garage. The exits are east, south, west. The user needs to find the pantry. Maybe the pantry is in one of these directions. Let's check the previous rooms. The Study had exits to east, north, west. The Salon had exits to east, north, south, west. The Washroom had exits to north, south, west. The Shower had exits to east, north, west. The Garage is the current room. The user needs to move east, south, or west from here.

But the user's previous actions have been moving west multiple times. Maybe the pantry is in the east direction from the Garage. Let's try going east from the Garage. That would take the user to the next room. If that room is the pantry, then they can proceed to get the bread. Alternatively, maybe the pantry is in the south or west direction. However, based on the initial steps, the user needs to go north again, but that's already been done. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go back through previous rooms to find the pantry.

Wait, the initial steps required traveling east twice, then opening the hatch, then going north, west, etc. The user might have already passed the pantry. But in the current path, the user is in the Garage. The pantry might be in a different part of the map. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check the current room for the pantry. But in the Garage, the description mentions a cabinet, but no pantry. So the user needs to move to another room.

The next logical step would be to go east from the Garage. Let's check that. If the user goes east, they might reach a room that's the pantry. Then, they can open the counter and take the bread. So the next action is to go east.

-= Pantry =-
You've just walked into a pantry. Let's see what's in here.

You can make out a counter. The counter is ordinary. On the counter you can see a loaf of bread.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.
