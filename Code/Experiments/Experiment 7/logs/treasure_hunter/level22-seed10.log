I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! First step, move south. And then, venture east. And then, move east. That done, make an attempt to travel east. Then, pick up the candy bar from the floor of the laundry place. Got that? Good!

-= Spare Room =-
Ah, the spare room. This is some kind of spare room, really great ordinary vibes in this place, a wonderful ordinary atmosphere. And now, well, you're in it. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You make out an opened crate nearby. The crate is empty! What a waste of a day! An open chest, which looks normal, is here. What a letdown! The chest is empty! You make out a shelf! The shelf is usual. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is an unblocked exit to the east. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

You've entered a playroom.

You make out a closed safe. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a portmanteau. You see a bar. The bar is ordinary. But the thing is empty. You can see a desk. Now why would someone leave that there? The desk is normal. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in the Laundromat room where there's a locked case. They tried using a key but it's not working. The previous attempts to use the key on the case weren't recognized. So, I need to figure out the right way to open the case.

First, the goal is to pick up the candy bar from the laundry place. The user has already moved through several rooms: Spare Room, Canteen, Playroom, Basement, and now Laundromat. In the Laundromat, there's a locked case, and the user needs to open it to get the candy bar.

But the user tried "use key on case" multiple times, which isn't working. Maybe the key isn't the right item here. Wait, in the Laundromat description, there's a locked case. Maybe the key is already in the inventory? Or maybe the correct action is to "open the case" instead of using a key. But the case is locked, so perhaps there's a key in another location.

Wait, the user mentioned earlier that they need to pick up the candy bar from the laundry place. Maybe the case is the one with the candy bar. But the case is locked. So the user needs to find the key. Where could the key be? Maybe in the Playroom or another room. But the user hasn't checked those areas yet.

Alternatively, maybe the correct action is to "use the key on the case" but the system isn't recognizing it. Maybe the key is in the inventory, and the correct command is "open case" if there's a key. But since the case is locked, perhaps the key is required. However, the user hasn't found the key yet.

Wait, in the Playroom, there's a closed safe. Maybe the key is inside the safe. But the user hasn't tried opening that yet. So the next step might be to go back to the Playroom, open the safe, find the key, then use it in the Laundromat.

But the user is currently in the Laundromat. So the steps would be: go back to Playroom, open safe, get key, go back to Laundromat, open case with key, then pick up candy bar.

But the user's previous actions led them to the Laundromat. So the next step is to find the key. But how? Maybe the key is in the Playroom's safe. So the user needs to go back to Playroom, open the safe, get the key, then return to Laundromat to open the case.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to pick up the candy bar from the laundry place. They've been moving through different rooms, ending up in the Laundromat where there's a locked case. The case is welded shut, and they've tried using a key but it's not working.

First, I need to recall the game's objective: find the candy bar in the laundry room. The user is stuck trying to open the locked case without the right key. Previous attempts to use the key on the case didn't work, so maybe the key isn't in their inventory. 

Looking at the rooms they've visited, the Playroom had a closed safe. Maybe the key is inside that safe. The user hasn't opened the safe yet. So the next logical step is to go back to the Playroom, open the safe, find the key, then return to the Laundromat to open the case with the key. 

But the user is currently in the Laundromat. They need to find a way back to the Playroom. The exits from the Laundromat are east and south. Going east leads to the Closet, then north to the Steam Room, then south back to the Closet, and west back to the Laundromat. Alternatively, maybe there's a different path. 

Wait, the user tried going west from the Laundromat and ended up back in the Laundromat. So maybe they need to go east to the Closet, then north to the Steam Room, then south back to the Closet, and then west to the Laundromat again. That's a loop. But the key is in the Playroom's safe, so they need to find a way back to the Playroom. 

Alternatively, maybe the key is in the Playroom, and the user needs to go back through the Playroom. The Playroom's exits are east and south. The user was in the Playroom earlier, so maybe they can go back. But how? The Playroom's exits are east (to the Basement) and south (to the Laundromat). Wait, the user is in the Laundromat, so to get to the Playroom, they need to go south from the Laundromat, but that's where they came from. 

Wait, the Laundromat's south exit leads back to the Playroom? Let me check the previous steps. The user was in the Laundromat, then went south to the Closet, then north to the Steam Room, then south back to the Closet, then west back to the Laundromat. So the Laundromat's south exit is to the Playroom? Or maybe the Playroom is connected differently. 

Alternatively, maybe the key is in the Playroom's safe, so the user needs to go back to the Playroom. The Playroom's exits are east (Basement) and south (Laundromat). So to get back to the Playroom from the Laundromat, the user would go south. But the Laundromat's south exit is to the Playroom? Wait, in the Laundromat's description, the exits are east and south. So going south from the Laundromat would take them back to the Playroom. 

So the user should go south from the Laundromat to the Playroom, open the safe there, get the key, then return to the Laundromat and use the key on the case. That makes sense. But the user is currently in the Laundromat and tried going south before, but maybe they got stuck in a loop. 

So the next step is to go south from the Laundromat to the Playroom, then open the safe. Then go back to the Laundromat, use the key on the case, and pick up the candy bar. But the user is in the Laundromat again, so the immediate next action is to go south to the Playroom.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, the user is stuck in the Laundromat trying to open a locked case. They've tried using a key multiple times but it's not working. The goal is to pick up the candy bar from the laundry place.

First, I need to figure out where the key is. The user has been moving through different rooms, including the Playroom, which had a closed safe. Maybe the key is in that safe. The user needs to go back to the Playroom, open the safe, get the key, then return to the Laundromat to open the case.

But the user is currently in the Laundromat. They need to find a way back to the Playroom. The exits from the Laundromat are east and south. Going south leads back to the Playroom. So the next step is to go south to the Playroom, open the safe, take the key, then return to the Laundromat and use the key on the case. That should break the loop and allow them to open the case and get the candy bar.

There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Closet =-
You've entered a closet. You begin looking for stuff.

You make out a workbench. The workbench appears to be empty. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a rack. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the rack.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unblocked exit to the north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, the user is stuck in the Laundromat trying to open a locked case. They've tried using a key multiple times but it's not working. The goal is to pick up the candy bar from the laundry place.

First, I need to figure out where the key is. The user has been moving through different rooms, including the Playroom, which had a closed safe. Maybe the key is in that safe. The user needs to go back to the Playroom, open the safe, get the key, then return to the Laundromat to open the case.

But the user is currently in the Laundromat. They need to find a way back to the Playroom. The exits from the Laundromat are east and south. Going south leads back to the Playroom. So the next step is to go south to the Playroom, open the safe, take the key, then return to the Laundromat and use the key on the case. That should break the loop and allow them to open the case and get the candy bar.

-= Chamber =-
Of every chamber you could have shown up in, you had to show up in a standard one.



There is an unguarded exit to the east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.
