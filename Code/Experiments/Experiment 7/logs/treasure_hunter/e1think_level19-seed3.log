Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First thing I need you to do is to make an attempt to go north. And then, make an attempt to take a trip north. And then, make an attempt to travel north. Then, travel east. After that, take a trip south. Then, make an effort to go to the east. With that accomplished, make an attempt to go south. If you can get through with that, venture west. If you can finish that, pick-up the worm from the floor of the kitchenette. Alright, thanks!

-= Sauna =-
You have fallen into the most standard of all possible saunas.

You make out a board. The board is ordinary. However, the board, like an empty board, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Shower =-
You are in a shower. A typical kind of place.

You can see a closed dresser in the room. You can make out a basket. You can see a bench. The bench is ordinary. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a rack. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The rack is typical. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to navigate through different rooms and pick up the worm from the kitchenette. So far, they've gone north from the sauna into the shower. The next steps mentioned were to travel east, then south, then west, and finally pick up the worm.

In the shower room, the user can go east or north or south. The previous actions were going north (from sauna to shower), then maybe trying to go east, south, etc. But the user is now in the shower, and the next step according to the initial instructions was to go east. However, the user might be stuck in a loop if they keep going back and forth between rooms without making progress. 

Looking at the current room (shower), the exits are east, north, and south. The user needs to go east first. If they go east, they might reach the kitchenette where the worm is. But the user's previous actions might have already tried going east, leading them back to the sauna or another room. Wait, the initial instructions said after going north (sauna to shower), then travel east, then south, then west. But in the shower, going east would be the next step. However, the user might have already tried that and ended up in a loop. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go south from the shower to return to the sauna, then west to exit. But the problem is that the user needs to find the worm in the kitchenette. The kitchenette isn't mentioned in the current room description. So perhaps the user needs to navigate through the rooms, but the current room is the shower. The exit to the east is unblocked. So the next logical step is to go east from the shower. If that leads to the kitchenette, then they can pick up the worm. If not, maybe they need to explore other exits. But according to the initial plan, after going east, then south, then west. So the next action should be to go east.
</think>go east

-= Kitchenette =-
A well framed board tells you that you are now in the kitchenette.

You smell a sickening smell, and follow it to a saucepan. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

There is a worm on the floor.

Okay, let's see. The user's goal is to pick up the worm from the kitchenette floor. So far, they've gone north, then east, ending up in the kitchenette. The current room is the kitchenette, and there's a worm on the floor.

First, I need to confirm the steps again. The original instructions were to go north, take a trip north, travel north, then east, south, east again, then south, then west, and finally pick up the worm. But maybe the exact path isn't critical; the main thing is to get to the kitchenette and pick up the worm.

In the current room, the user is in the kitchenette. The prompt says there's a worm on the floor. So the next logical step is to pick it up. The previous actions have already led them here, so the next command should be to take the worm. But the user's last action was going east, which brought them to the kitchenette. Now, they need to pick up the worm. The correct command would be "take worm" or "pick up worm". Since the game might expect a specific verb, "take" is more likely. So the next action is to take the worm.
</think>take worm
