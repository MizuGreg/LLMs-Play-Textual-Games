Welcome to another fast paced session of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First thing I need you to do is to go west. Next, go to the south. After that, pick-up the chocolate bar from the floor of the chamber. That's it!

-= Study =-
You are in a study. A typical kind of place.



There is an unblocked exit to the south. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

-= Kitchenette =-
I just think it's great that you've just entered a kitchenette.

You can see a freezer.

There is an open hatch leading north. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text-based game where they need to follow specific steps to reach the goal. The initial instructions said to go west, then south, pick up the chocolate bar. 

First, the user started by going west from the study, which led them to the kitchenette. Now, they need to proceed south from the kitchenette. The next step according to the original plan was to go south after going west. But the user is in the kitchenette now, so the next logical step would be to go south from here.

Looking at the current room description, there's an exit to the south, so moving south makes sense. The goal is to pick up the chocolate bar, which was in the study. But the user is now in the kitchenette. Wait, maybe the chocolate bar is in a different location. Wait, the original instruction said to pick up the chocolate bar from the floor of the chamber. The study was the starting point. But after moving west to the kitchenette, maybe the next step is to go south back to the study? Or perhaps the chocolate is in another room.

Wait, the user's first action was go west, leading to the kitchenette. Then the next step was to go south. But in the kitchenette, the exits are north, east, south, and west. So going south from the kitchenette would take them back to the study. Then, in the study, they need to pick up the chocolate bar. But the initial instruction said to go west, then south. Wait, maybe the original plan was to go west (to kitchenette), then south (back to study), then pick up the chocolate. But the user is now in the kitchenette, so the next step is to go south to return to the study. Then, in the study, they can pick up the chocolate. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action should be to go south from the kitchenette to return to the study. Then, in the study, pick up the chocolate. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next command is to go south.
</think>go south

-= Chamber =-
You make another one of your grand eccentric entrances into a chamber.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the north.

There is a chocolate bar on the floor.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing a text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and collect items. The goal is to pick up the chocolate bar from the Chamber room.

First, I need to recall the previous steps. The user started in the Study, went west to the Kitchenette, then south to the Chamber. Now, in the Chamber, there's a chocolate bar on the floor. The next step should be to pick it up.

Wait, the user's last action was "go south", which led them to the Chamber. The current room has the chocolate bar. So the next logical step is to pick up the chocolate bar. The game's instruction said to pick it up from the floor of the chamber. So the correct command here is "take chocolate bar" or "pick up chocolate bar".

But I need to make sure that the command is exactly what the game expects. In TextWorld, the correct verb is usually "take" for picking up items. So the next action should be "take chocolate bar". Let me check the previous interactions. The user was told to "pick-up the chocolate bar from the floor of the chamber. That's it!" So maybe "pick up" is acceptable. But in the game's context, "take" might be the right verb. However, the user's previous action was "go south", and the current room has the chocolate bar. The correct command here is to pick it up. So the answer should be "take chocolate bar" or "pick up chocolate bar". Since the user's instruction said "pick-up", maybe "pick up" is correct. But I need to check if the game uses "take" or "pick up". In many TextWorld scenarios, "take" is the standard command. However, the user's initial instruction said "pick-up", so maybe the game expects "pick up". But the user's previous action was "go west" and "go south", so the next step is to pick up the chocolate bar. Therefore, the correct command is "pick up chocolate bar".
</think>pick up chocolate bar
