Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First off, go north. With that accomplished, make an effort to travel north. If you can get through with that, attempt to take a trip west. Okay, and then, attempt to travel south. And then, try to venture south. Then, try to move west. With that done, try to go to the west. With that done, attempt to go west. And then, pick-up the key from the floor of the canteen. Alright, thanks!

This is going to sound unbelievable, but you've just entered a cookery. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a freezer. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this?

There is an open door leading south. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in a TextWorld game and needs to follow a series of directions to reach the key in the canteen. The goal is to pick up the key from the canteen's floor.

First, I need to recap the steps given. The initial instructions were to go north, then north again, then west, south, west, and then pick up the key. But the user has already gone through some areas: from Cookery to Garage, Studio, Bedchamber, back to Studio, then to Basement, and then to Laundry Place. 

Now, the current location is the Laundry Place. The next step according to the original plan was to go west again, but the user might be stuck in a loop. Let me check the previous steps. The user went north, north, west, south, west, then south again. Now, in the Laundry Place, the exits are east, north, south, and west. The user needs to find the canteen, which is probably in a different area. 

Wait, the original plan mentioned going west from the Studio to the Basement, then south to Laundry Place. But the key is in the canteen. Maybe the canteen is in a different direction. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east from the Laundry Place. Let me check the exits again. The Laundry Place has an unblocked exit to the east. Maybe that's the way to go. 

But the user's previous actions might have led them in a loop. The key is in the canteen, which is probably in the north or east direction. Since the user is in the Laundry Place, going east might lead them to the canteen. Alternatively, the canteen could be in the north. But the user needs to find the key. Let me think: the user needs to go to the canteen's floor and pick up the key. So the correct path is to go east from Laundry Place to reach the canteen, then pick up the key. 

But the user's last action was going south to Laundry Place. Now, from there, the next step should be east. So the next command is go east.

<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to pick up the key from the canteen's floor. So far, they've been moving between different areas: Cookery, Garage, Studio, Bedchamber, Basement, Laundry Place, and back to Garage, Studio, Basement, Laundry Place again. It seems like they're stuck in a loop between the Laundry Place and the Garage, Studio, and Basement.

Looking at the current location, they're in the Laundry Place. The exits are east, north, south, and west. The previous actions went east to Garage, then north to Studio, west to Basement, south back to Laundry. So the loop is Laundry <--> Garage <--> Studio <--> Basement <--> Laundry.

The key is in the canteen, which hasn't been mentioned yet. The user hasn't reached the canteen yet. So the next step should be to find the canteen. Since the Laundry Place has an exit to the east (Garage), north (Studio), south (Basement), and west (Basement). Wait, maybe the canteen is in a different area. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west from the Laundry Place to the Basement, then find another exit. But the Basement has an exit to the east (Laundry), north (unguarded), and south (unblocked). Wait, the Basement's description says there's an unguarded exit to the east, north, and west. So maybe going north from the Basement would lead to another area. But the user hasn't tried that yet.

Alternatively, maybe the canteen is in the north from the Laundry Place. But the Laundry Place's north exit is to the Studio. The Studio's north is Garage, which loops back. Hmm. Maybe the user needs to go west from the Laundry Place to the Basement, then north to another area. But the Basement's north exit is unguarded. Let me check the Basement's description again. The Basement has an unguarded exit to the north. So from the Basement, going north would be the next step. But the user is currently in the Laundry Place. So from Laundry Place, going north to Studio, then north to Garage, then north again to Studio? That's not helpful.

Wait, maybe the canteen is in the north from the Studio. But the Studio's north exit is to the Garage. The Garage's north is another area. But the user hasn't reached that yet. Alternatively, maybe the canteen is in the east from the Laundry Place. But the user went east to Garage, which loops back. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go south from the Laundry Place to the Basement, then east to the Laundry Place again. That's not helpful. This seems like a loop. The user needs to find a way out of the loop to reach the canteen. Since the key is in the canteen, perhaps the canteen is in the north from the Studio. But the Studio's north is Garage. Maybe the user needs to go west from the Studio to the Basement, then north to another area. But the Basement's north is unguarded. 

Wait, the user's last action was going south from Laundry Place to Basement. Now, in the Basement, the exits are east (Laundry), north (unguarded), and west (unblocked). So from the Basement, going north might be the way to go. But the user hasn't tried that yet. So the next step should be to go north from the Basement. But the user is in the Basement, so the command would be "go north". However, the user's previous actions have led them in a loop, so they need to try a different direction. Since the user is in the Basement, going north might lead them to a new area where the canteen is. Alternatively, maybe the canteen is in the north from the Studio. But the user needs to break the loop. The key is to find the canteen, so maybe the correct path is to go north from the Basement. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action should be "go north" from the Basement.

Okay, let's see. The user's goal is to pick up the key from the canteen's floor. So far, they've been moving between different areas, but they're stuck in a loop between the Laundry Place, Garage, Studio, Basement, and Closet. They've tried going east, north, south, west multiple times without finding the canteen.

Looking at the current location, they're in the Basement again. The exits here are east (to the Bedchamber), north (unguarded), south (unblocked), and west (unblocked). The key is in the canteen, which hasn't been mentioned yet. The user needs to find the canteen. 

Wait, the Closet was mentioned earlier. When they went east from the Closet, they ended up in the Bedchamber. Maybe the canteen is in a different area. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go north from the Basement. But the Basement's north exit is unguarded. Let me check the previous steps. The user went from the Closet to the Bedchamber, then to the Studio, then to the Basement again. 

The key is in the canteen, which is probably in a different part of the map. The user hasn't reached the canteen yet. The previous actions have led them in a loop, so they need to find a different path. Maybe the canteen is in the north from the Studio. But the Studio's north exit is the Garage, which loops back. Alternatively, maybe the canteen is in the east from the Basement. But the user went east to the Bedchamber, which is part of the loop. 

Wait, the user is in the Basement. The exits are east (Bedchamber), north (unguarded), south (unblocked), and west (unblocked). The key is in the canteen. Maybe the canteen is in the north from the Basement. So the next step should be to go north from the Basement. But the user has been going back and forth between the Basement and other areas. Since the user is in the Basement again, the next action should be to go north to break the loop and find the canteen.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Closet, Kitchen, Bedchamber, Studio, and Basement. The goal is to pick up the key from the canteen. So far, they've been moving east and west between these areas without finding the canteen.

First, the goal is to reach the canteen and pick up the key. The user has been going back and forth between the Closet, Kitchen, Bedchamber, Studio, and Basement. The key is in the canteen, which hasn't been mentioned yet. Maybe the canteen is in a different area not yet explored.

Second, the past actions have led the user in a loop. They've tried going east, west, north, south multiple times. The next step should be to find a new path. The user is in the Closet now. The exits are east, south, and west. The Kitchen was previously visited, but the canteen isn't there. Maybe the canteen is in the north from the Closet, but the user has been going east instead.

Third, the loop is between the Closet, Kitchen, Bedchamber, Studio, and Basement. To break it, the user needs to find a different exit. The Closet has an unguarded exit to the east (Kitchen), south (Bedchamber), and west (Basement). The user has been going east and west. Maybe they need to go south from the Closet to the Bedchamber, then find another exit. But the Bedchamber's exit is south to the Studio. The Studio's exit is north to the Garage. The Garage's exit is north to the Studio again. This isn't working.

Wait, the user is in the Closet. The Closet's exit to the east is the Kitchen. The Kitchen's exit to the east is unguarded. Maybe the canteen is in the east from the Kitchen. But the user hasn't checked that. So the next step should be to go east from the Kitchen. But the user is in the Closet. So from the Closet, go east to the Kitchen, then east again to find the canteen. But the user has been going back and forth. The key is in the canteen, so maybe the canteen is in the east from the Kitchen. The user needs to try that.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Closet, Kitchen, Bedchamber, Studio, and Basement. The goal is to pick up the key from the canteen. So far, they've been moving east and west without finding the canteen.

First, the goal is to reach the canteen and pick up the key. The user has been looping between these areas, so they need to find a new path. The key is in the canteen, which hasn't been mentioned yet. Maybe the canteen is in a different area not yet explored.

Second, the past actions have led the user in a loop. They've tried going east, west, north, south multiple times. The next step should be to find a new exit. The user is in the Closet now. The exits are east, south, and west. The Kitchen was previously visited, but the canteen isn't there. Maybe the canteen is in the north from the Closet, but the user has been going east instead.

Third, the loop is between the Closet, Kitchen, Bedchamber, Studio, and Basement. To break it, the user needs to find a different exit. The Closet has an unguarded exit to the east (Kitchen), south (Bedchamber), and west (Basement). The user has been going east and west. Maybe they need to go south from the Closet to the Bedchamber, then find another exit. But the Bedchamber's exit is south to the Studio. The Studio's exit is north to the Garage. The Garage's exit is north to the Studio again. This isn't working.

Wait, the user is in the Closet. The Closet's exit to the east is the Kitchen. The Kitchen's exit to the east is unguarded. Maybe the canteen is in the east from the Kitchen. The user needs to try that. So from the Closet, go east to the Kitchen, then east again to find the canteen. But the user has been going back and forth. The key is in the canteen, so maybe the canteen is in the east from the Kitchen. The user needs to try that.

Okay, let's try to figure out how to win this game. The user's goal is to pick up the key from the canteen. So far, they've been moving between different rooms like the Closet, Kitchen, Bedchamber, Studio, and Basement, but they haven't found the canteen yet.

Looking at the current location, they're in the Basement. The exits here are east (Closet), north (unguarded), south (unblocked), and west (unblocked). The key is in the canteen, which hasn't been mentioned in the descriptions yet. The user has been looping between these areas without finding the canteen.

The previous actions have led them in a loop, so they need to break the cycle. The user is in the Basement, and the next step should be to go north to check if that leads to the canteen. Since the Basement's north exit is unguarded, going north might be the way to go. The user has been going east and west, so trying north could be the key to escaping the loop and finding the canteen.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's try to figure out how to win this game. The user's goal is to pick up the key from the canteen. So far, they've been moving between different rooms like the Closet, Kitchen, Bedchamber, Studio, Basement, Study, Steam Room, Cookhouse, and Cubicle. They haven't found the canteen yet.

Looking at the current location, they're in the Steam Room. The exits here are east (Cookhouse) and north (unblocked). The key is in the canteen, which hasn't been mentioned yet. The user has been looping between these areas without finding the canteen.

The previous actions have led them in a loop, so they need to break the cycle. The user is in the Steam Room, and the next step should be to go north to check if that leads to the canteen. Since the Steam Room has an unblocked exit to the north, going north might be the way to go. The user has been going east and west, so trying north could be the key to escaping the loop and finding the canteen.

Okay, let's try to figure out how to win this game. The user's goal is to pick up the key from the canteen. So far, they've been moving between the Closet, Kitchen, and Study, looping back without finding the canteen.

First, the goal is to reach the canteen and pick up the key. The user has been stuck in a loop between these areas. The key is in the canteen, which hasn't been mentioned yet. Maybe the canteen is in a different area not yet explored.

Second, the past actions have led the user in a loop. They've tried going east and west between the Closet and Kitchen. The next step should be to find a new path. The user is in the Closet, so maybe going south from there could lead to a new area. The Closet has an unguarded exit to the south.

Third, the loop is between the Closet, Kitchen, and Study. To break it, the user needs to try a different direction. From the Closet, going south might lead to the canteen. So the next action is to go south from the Closet.
