Welcome to TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First, it would be a great idea if you could attempt to head south. With that done, make an effort to take a trip west. Then, travel south. With that over with, make an effort to venture east. And then, move east. Then, pick-up the passkey from the floor of the bar. That's it!

You find yourself in a cookhouse. A standard one.

You can see a closed chest in the corner. You see a counter. The counter is ordinary. But the thing is empty. Hm. Oh well

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they need to follow specific steps to reach the goal. The goal is to pick up the passkey from the floor of the bar. Let me recap the steps they need to take.

First, they should go south from the cookhouse. Then west, then south again, then east, then east again. After that, they need to go to the bar and pick up the passkey. 

Looking at the current state, the user is back in the Chamber after going west from the Laundromat. They've already done the initial steps: south, west, south, east, and then west again, which brought them back to the Chamber. So they're in a loop here. 

The problem is that they're stuck in the Chamber, which they've already been to. The next step should be to try a different direction instead of going west again. The previous action was going west, which led back to the Chamber. So maybe instead of west, they should try north or east again. But the Chamber has exits to north, east, south. The user needs to find a way to proceed without looping.

Wait, the original plan was after going east from the Chamber, they would go to the Laundromat, then west back to Chamber, but that's not helping. Maybe they need to go north from the Chamber. Let me check the Chamber's description again. The Chamber has an exit to the north, which is unblocked. So maybe going north from the Chamber would take them to another area. But the user's previous steps might have already been through that path. Alternatively, maybe they need to go east again from the Chamber. 

But the user is in the Chamber again, so the next step should be to try a different direction. Since going west led back, perhaps going north or east. The user's next action should be to go north from the Chamber. That way, they can proceed further without looping. So the correct next command is "go north".

Okay, let's break this down. The user is stuck in a loop between the Scullery and Attic, repeatedly going back and forth. The goal is to pick up the passkey from the bar. 

First, the original plan was to go south, west, south, east, east, then to the bar. But the user has been looping between Scullery and Attic, which are different from the bar. So the main issue is not following the correct path to the bar.

Looking at the current position, the user is in the Scullery again. The previous actions led them to the Attic and back. The next step should be to find the correct path to the bar. The initial instructions mentioned that after going east from the Chamber, they should go to the Laundromat, then west to Chamber, but that didn't work. Maybe they need to go north from the Scullery to reach the Studio, then find another exit.

Wait, in the Studio, there's a locked toolbox and a closed bureau. Maybe the passkey is in the toolbox or bureau, but the user hasn't checked those yet. However, the goal is to pick up the passkey from the bar, so maybe the bar is in a different area. The user might have missed the correct path to the bar.

Alternatively, the user might need to go east from the Scullery, which was mentioned as unguarded. The Scullery's description says to try going east. So perhaps the next step is to go east from Scullery to reach the Laundromat again, then proceed further. But the user has already done that before. Maybe they need to check the Laundromat for the passkey, but the Laundromat's description didn't mention it.

Wait, the original task said to pick up the passkey from the floor of the bar. So the user needs to reach the bar. The path to the bar wasn't followed yet. The initial steps were to go south, west, south, east, east. But the user got stuck in a loop. Maybe after the initial steps, they need to go east again from the Chamber to the Laundromat, then find the correct exit to the bar.

But in the current state, the user is in the Scullery. The correct action would be to go east to the Laundromat again, then check if the bar is there. Alternatively, maybe the bar is in the Studio or Attic. But the user hasn't checked those areas yet. The key is to break the loop and find the correct path to the bar. The next command should be to go east from Scullery to proceed further.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Scullery and Attic, going back and forth. The goal is to pick up the passkey from the bar. The initial steps were to go south, west, south, east, east, then to the bar. But the user hasn't reached the bar yet.

Looking at the current position, the user is in the Studio again. The Studio has a locked toolbox and a closed bureau. Maybe the passkey is in one of these? But the original task says to pick it up from the bar. So perhaps the user needs to find the bar.

Wait, the user has been moving between Scullery, Attic, Studio, and back. The bar hasn't been mentioned in any of these areas. Maybe the bar is in a different location. The initial instructions said to go east from the Chamber to the Laundromat, then west to Chamber, but that didn't work. Maybe the user needs to go north from the Studio to reach the bar.

Alternatively, the user might need to check the toolbox or bureau in the Studio for the passkey. But the goal is the bar. Hmm. The user is in a loop, so the next step should be to break the loop by trying a different direction. Since going east and west hasn't worked, maybe going north from the Studio to find the bar.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is stuck in a loop between the Scullery and Attic, repeatedly going back and forth. The goal is to pick up the passkey from the bar. 

First, the original plan was to go south, west, south, east, east, then to the bar. But the user hasn't reached the bar yet. The current position is in the Scullery again. The previous actions led them to the Attic and back. The next step should be to find the correct path to the bar.

Looking at the current environment, the Scullery has an exit to the east, which was mentioned as unguarded. Maybe the user needs to go east from the Scullery to reach the Laundromat again, then proceed further. But the user has already done that before. Alternatively, maybe the bar is in the Studio or another area. The user needs to break the loop by trying a different direction. Since going east and west hasn't worked, maybe going north from the Scullery to the Studio again. But the Studio has a locked toolbox and bureau, not the bar. Hmm.

Wait, the initial instructions said to pick up the passkey from the floor of the bar. The user hasn't found the bar yet. The loop is between Scullery and Attic, so the user needs to find another exit. The Scullery has an unguarded exit to the south, which is the Cookhouse. Maybe going south from Scullery to Cookhouse, then east to the kitchen, and then find the bar. But the user hasn't tried that yet. The next action should be to go east from Scullery to break the loop and proceed towards the bar.

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the south. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

Look over there! a case. You look around you, at all the containers and supporters, doors and objects, and you think to yourself. Why? Why Textworld? You can see a fridge. The fridge is empty! What a waste of a day!

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between Scullery, Attic, and Studio. The goal is to pick up the passkey from the bar. They've been moving east and west repeatedly without progress. The key is to break the loop and find the bar.

First, the goal is to reach the bar and pick up the passkey. The user has been going back and forth between Scullery and Attic, missing the correct path. The Studio has a locked toolbox and bureau, but the bar isn't there. The user needs to find another exit.

Second, the past actions have not led to the bar. The user needs to try a different direction. The Scullery has an unguarded exit to the south (Cookhouse), which was mentioned earlier. Maybe going south from Scullery to Cookhouse, then east to the kitchen, and then find the bar.

Third, the loop is between Scullery and Attic. The user should try going east from Scullery to the Studio again, then check the toolbox or bureau for the passkey. But the passkey is supposed to be in the bar. Alternatively, maybe the bar is in the Kitchen. The user needs to go south from Scullery to Cookhouse, then east to Kitchen, then check there.

The next action should be to go east from Scullery to break the loop and proceed towards the bar.

You find yourself in a cookhouse. A standard one.

You can see a closed chest in the corner. You see a counter. The counter is ordinary. But the thing is empty. Hm. Oh well

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between Scullery, Attic, and Studio. The goal is to pick up the passkey from the bar. They've been moving east and west without progress. The key is to break the loop and find the bar.

First, the goal is to reach the bar and pick up the passkey. The user has been going back and forth between Scullery and Attic, missing the correct path. The Studio has a locked toolbox and bureau, but the bar isn't there. The user needs to find another exit.

Second, the past actions have not led to the bar. The user needs to try a different direction. The Scullery has an unguarded exit to the south (Cookhouse), which was mentioned earlier. Maybe going south from Scullery to Cookhouse, then east to the kitchen, and then find the bar.

Third, the loop is between Scullery and Attic. The user should try going east from Scullery to the Studio again, then check the toolbox or bureau for the passkey. But the passkey is supposed to be in the bar. Alternatively, maybe the bar is in the Kitchen. The user needs to go south from Scullery to Cookhouse, then east to Kitchen, then check there.

The next action should be to go east from Scullery to break the loop and proceed towards the bar.
