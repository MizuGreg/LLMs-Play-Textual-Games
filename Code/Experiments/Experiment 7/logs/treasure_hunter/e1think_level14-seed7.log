Welcome to TextWorld! Here is how to play! First, it would be a great idea if you could make an attempt to head east. Okay, and then, go to the north. Okay, and then, go to the north. If you can finish that, make an effort to take a trip east. And then, pick up the latchkey from the pan. Got that? Good!

-= Laundry Place =-
You have walked into a laundry place. Not the laundry place you'd expect. No, this is a laundry place. You begin looking for stuff.

You can see an opened cabinet, which looks ordinary, in the corner. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You make out a table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

There is an open portal leading east. There is an open hatch leading north.

Guess what, you are in a place we're calling a bedroom. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.



There is an open gate leading north. There is an open portal leading west.

There is a loaf of bread on the floor.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a TextWorld game, and their goal is to reach the end, which I assume involves finding items or exiting the environment. The current location is a bedroom with a loaf of bread on the floor.

First, I need to recall the initial instructions. The user was told to go east, then north, then east again, and pick up the latchkey from the pan. But in the current scenario, they're in the bedroom. The previous action was going east from the laundry place, which led them to the bedroom.

Looking at the current room: there's a gate north, a portal west, and bread on the floor. The goal might be to find the latchkey or reach a specific location. The user mentioned picking up the latchkey from the pan, but in the bedroom, there's no mention of a pan. Maybe the pan is in another room.

The user's past actions: they went east from the laundry place to the bedroom. Now, they need to proceed further. The next step might be to go north through the open gate. But if they go west, they might loop back to the laundry place. However, the initial instructions said to go north twice, then east again. But in the current room, going north would take them to another area. Alternatively, maybe the bread is a clue, but the goal is to find the latchkey.

Wait, the user's goal is to pick up the latchkey from the pan. So maybe the pan is in the laundry place or another room. But in the laundry place, there's an empty cabinet and a table. The bedroom has bread, but no pan. So perhaps the next step is to go north from the bedroom through the gate. That would take them to another room, maybe where the pan is. Then, after finding the pan, they can pick up the latchkey. But the user needs to follow the steps given in the initial instructions: go east, north, north, east, then pick up the latchkey.

But in the current room, the user is in the bedroom. The next step after going east to the bedroom would be to go north. Then, from there, maybe go east again. But the user needs to check if they're in a loop. If they go north from the bedroom, they might reach a new area. Let's assume that going north from the bedroom leads to a room with the pan. Then, after that, they can go east again to find the latchkey. But the user needs to make sure they don't loop. Since the initial steps were to go east, north, north, east, the current step is to go north from the bedroom. Then, after that, maybe east again. But the user has to make sure they don't repeat actions that don't progress. So the next action is to go north.

-= Bathroom =-
You find yourself in a bathroom. A standard kind of place.

Were you looking for a board? Because look over there, it's a board. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is an open gateway leading north. There is an open gate leading south.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing a text adventure game, and they've moved through different rooms: the Laundry Place, then the Bedroom, and now the Bathroom. The goal mentioned earlier was to pick up the latchkey from the pan. Let me check where the latchkey might be.

In the Laundry Place, there was an opened cabinet, but it was empty. Then in the Bedroom, there was a loaf of bread on the floor. The Bathroom has a board with nothing on it. The user has been moving north from the Laundry Place to the Bedroom, then to the Bathroom. The next step would be to check the north gateway from the Bathroom. But the goal is to find the latchkey. Maybe the latchkey is in one of the previous rooms? Wait, the user hasn't checked all areas yet. Maybe the cabinet in the Laundry Place had something, but it was described as empty. Alternatively, maybe the pan is in the Bedroom or Bathroom. The user needs to search carefully. Since the previous actions were moving north, maybe the next step is to go north again from the Bathroom. But the user has to make sure they're not looping. The last action was go north, leading to the Bathroom. Now, from the Bathroom, going north again might be the next step. But the user needs to check if that's the right direction. Alternatively, maybe the latchkey is in the pan somewhere, and the user needs to look for it. But the instructions say to pick up the latchkey from the pan. So maybe the pan is in one of the rooms. The user hasn't checked the Bathroom's items yet. Wait, the Bathroom has a board, but no items. The Bedroom had a loaf of bread. The Laundry Place's cabinet was empty. Maybe the pan is in the Bathroom? The user hasn't checked the Bathroom's items thoroughly. So the next step would be to check the north gateway, but maybe the pan is in the Bathroom. Alternatively, the user might need to look around more. But according to the previous steps, the user needs to go north again. However, the user is in the Bathroom, and the north gateway is there. So the next action would be to go north again. But the user needs to make sure they're not in a loop. Since the previous steps were moving north, maybe the next step is to go north again. But the user has to check if that's the correct direction. Alternatively, maybe the pan is in the Bathroom, and the user needs to look for it. But the description says the Bathroom has a board with nothing on it. So maybe the pan is in another room. The user needs to continue exploring. The next action would be to go north from the Bathroom.

-= Cubicle =-
I am sorry to announce that you are now in the cubicle.

You see a coffer. You make out an opened trunk. The trunk is empty! What a waste of a day!

There is an open gateway leading south. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing a text adventure game called TextWorld. The goal is to find the latchkey from the pan, as mentioned in the initial instructions. Let me recap the steps taken so far.

First, the user started in the Laundry Place, went east to the Bedroom, then north to the Bathroom, and then north again to the Cubicle. Now, in the Cubicle, there's a coffer and an opened trunk, but they're empty. The prompt suggests trying to go east instead of continuing north.

So, the goal is to find the latchkey. The user has moved through several rooms but hasn't found the key yet. The current room is the Cubicle, and the available exits are south and east. The previous actions were all going north, which might be leading to a loop. The user needs to break the loop by trying a different direction, like east.

In the Cubicle, the hint says to try going east. So the next step should be to go east. That's the logical move to avoid looping and to explore new areas where the latchkey might be located.

-= Cookhouse =-
Wow! You're in a cookhouse. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You make out a pan. The pan is ordinary. On the pan you see a latchkey. You scan the room, seeing a bowl. However, the bowl, like an empty bowl, has nothing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the bowl.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.



>                                                                                                                                -= Cookhouse =-0/5

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a TextWorld game, and their goal is to find the latchkey and probably exit the game. The initial instructions mentioned picking up the latchkey from the pan.

Looking at the current location: Cookhouse. The user sees a pan with a latchkey on it. The previous actions were moving east from the cubicle, which led to the cookhouse. Now, the next logical step is to pick up the latchkey. The user hasn't done that yet. The command should be to take the latchkey from the pan. But the system might expect a different verb, like 'take' or 'get'. However, in TextWorld, the correct command is usually 'take' followed by the item. So the next action should be 'take latchkey' or 'take the latchkey'. But the user's previous actions were moving directions, so maybe the correct command here is to pick up the latchkey. The answer should be 'take latchkey'.
