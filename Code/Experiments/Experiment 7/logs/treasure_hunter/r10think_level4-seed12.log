Welcome to TextWorld! Here is how to play! First of all, you could, like, venture south. Okay, and then, recover the bug from the floor of the closet. Alright, thanks!

-= Vault =-
You find yourself in a vault. A normal one.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the south. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

-= Closet =-
You've entered a closet. Let's see what's in here.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a durian and a bug on the floor.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in the closet, trying to take the bug from the floor but keeps getting an error. The goal is to recover the bug from the closet's floor. The user has tried "take the bug from the floor" multiple times, but the game says it can't see the bug. Wait, maybe the bug isn't on the floor? The initial description said there's a durian and a bug on the floor. So the user should be able to take the bug. But the game isn't recognizing it. Maybe the correct command is just "take the bug" without specifying the floor? Or maybe "pick up the bug"? Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check the floor first. But the user is already in the closet. Hmm. The previous attempts used "take the bug from the floor," but the game says it's not there. Maybe the bug is just on the floor, so the command should be "take the bug" or "pick up the bug." Alternatively, maybe the user needs to look under something. But the initial description only mentions the durian and the bug on the floor. So the correct action is probably "take the bug" without the "from the floor" part. Let me try that.
