You are now playing a profound game of TextWorld! First stop, attempt to take a trip east. After that, pick-up the fondue from the floor of the cookhouse. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Chamber =-
You're now in the chamber. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.

-= Cookhouse =-
You have fallen into the most typical of all possible cookhouses.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

There is a fondue on the floor.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The user is playing a text-based game where they need to follow specific steps to win. The goal is to first go east, then pick up the fondue from the cookhouse, and then win.

Looking at the current scenario, the user is in the Cookhouse. The previous action was going east, which led them here. Now, the prompt mentions that there's a fondue on the floor. So the next step should be to pick up the fondue. 

The user's past actions include going east, which was the first step. Now, they need to collect the fondue. The next step is to take the fondue. But the user has to make sure they don't repeat actions. Since they've already gone east once, maybe they need to use a different verb, like 'take' instead of 'go' for the fondue. 

Wait, the instruction says to output the next action as a short command. So the correct command here would be 'take fondue' or 'get fondue'. But in the game's context, the correct command might be 'take fondue' since that's what's on the floor. 

I need to check if there's any loop. The user went east once, then entered the cookhouse. Now, they need to pick up the fondue. Since the fondue is present here, taking it should be the next step. No loop detected here. So the next action is to take the fondue.
