Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is how to play! First stop, attempt to move east. Then, pick up the key from the toolbox inside the vault. And then, check that the gate is unlocked with the key. And then, look and see that the gate inside the vault is ajar. Then, make an effort to take a trip north. Then, go north. With that accomplished, head north. Once you manage that, attempt to head west. With that over with, attempt to venture south. Then, attempt to go south. Then, go west. Once you do that, go west. If you can accomplish that, move west. With that accomplished, pick-up the keycard from the floor of the canteen. Alright, thanks!

-= Cellar =-
You've entered a cellar.

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a rack. The rack is ordinary. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is an unguarded exit to the east.

FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a TextWorld game. Their goal is to follow a series of steps to complete the game. Let me break down what they've done so far.

First, they started in the Cellar, moved east to the Vault. Then they picked up the key from the toolbox. Next, they unlocked the gate leading north. Now, the next step according to the initial instructions was to check if the gate inside the vault is ajar. But after unlocking the gate, maybe they need to move north through the gate.

Wait, the current location is the Vault. The gate leading north is unlocked. So the next logical step is to go north. The user's previous action was unlocking the gate, so the next step should be moving north. Let me check the environment again. The Vault has a closed gate north and an exit west. After unlocking the north gate, they can pass through it. So the next action should be "go north". That makes sense. The user hasn't moved north yet, so that's the next step. No loops here because each action leads to progress. So the next command is "go north".

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in the Vault, trying to go north but the gate is closed. They already picked up the key and unlocked the gate, but maybe they didn't open it properly. Wait, the previous message said "You have to open the gate first." So maybe unlocking isn't enough? Maybe they need to open it fully. The user tried "go north" again, but the game says they need to open the gate first. So the next step is to open the gate again. But how? They have the key. Maybe they need to use the key on the gate again. Wait, the initial steps were to unlock the gate with the key. Maybe the gate is locked but not unlocked. Wait, the user already unlocked it, but perhaps the gate is still closed. So maybe they need to open it, not just unlock. So the correct action would be to open the gate with the key. But the previous action was unlocking, so maybe the synonym is "open gate". So the next command should be "open gate".

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a TextWorld game and needs to follow specific steps to win. The goal seems to be moving through different rooms and completing tasks.

First, the initial steps mentioned were: move east from the cellar, pick up the key from the vault, unlock the gate, check the gate is ajar, go north, then proceed through various rooms. But the user is now in the Garage, having gone north from the Cookery room.

Looking at the current location, the Garage has exits to the south, west, and north. The previous actions included moving east, then north through the vault's gate. Now, the user is in the Garage. The next steps might involve moving west or south, but the goal is to reach the canteen to pick up the keycard.

Wait, the original instructions said after moving west from the vault, go west again, then pick up the keycard from the canteen. But the user is in the Garage now. Maybe they need to go west from the Garage to reach the canteen. Alternatively, maybe the correct path is to go north from the Garage, but the user has already done that. Wait, the user just came from the Cookery room, which is north of the Garage. So the next step might be to go west from the Garage to reach the canteen. But the user hasn't picked up the keycard yet. The keycard is in the canteen's floor. So the next action should be to go west to the canteen, then pick up the keycard. But the user is in the Garage, so the next command is "go west".

First, the initial steps were: move east from the cellar, pick up the key from the vault, unlock the gate, check the gate is ajar, go north, then proceed through various rooms. But the user is now in the Washroom, having looped between the Launderette and Washroom by going west and east repeatedly.

The user's past actions include moving east, north, west, south, and back, which has led them into a loop between the Launderette and Washroom. The next step should be to break this loop. Since the user is in the Washroom, they need to find the keycard in the canteen, but they haven't reached that yet. However, the current path seems to be stuck in a cycle. The correct action would be to go north from the Washroom to exit the loop and proceed towards the canteen. So the next command should be "go north".

The goal was to pick up the keycard from the canteen, but they haven't reached it yet. The previous steps involved moving through various rooms, but they're now stuck in a cycle.

First, the goal is to follow the initial steps: move east, pick up the key, unlock the gate, check the gate, go north, then proceed through the rooms to reach the canteen and pick up the keycard. However, the user has been looping between Washroom and Launderette without making progress towards the canteen.

Second, the past actions include moving east, north, west, south, and back, which has led to the loop. The next step should be to break the loop and find a different path. Since the user is in the Washroom, maybe they need to go north from here instead of east or west.

Third, the loop is between Washroom and Launderette. The correct action would be to go north from the Washroom to exit the loop and proceed towards the canteen. The previous actions of going east and west are keeping them in the loop, so changing direction to north would be the key.

There is an open passageway leading east. There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Washroom, Launderette, and Chamber. They've been moving back and forth between these rooms without making progress towards the canteen where the keycard is located. The goal is to pick up the keycard from the canteen, but the user hasn't reached it yet.

First, the goal steps involve moving through various rooms, picking up items, and navigating exits. The user has already picked up the key in the vault and unlocked the gate. Now, they need to proceed to the canteen to get the keycard. However, their current path is looping between the Washroom and Launderette, which isn't leading them closer to the canteen.

Second, the past actions show that the user has been going east and west between the Washroom and Launderette, which is causing the loop. The next step should be to find a different path. The Chamber has an exit to the east and south. Maybe going south from the Chamber would lead them towards the canteen.

Third, the loop is between the Washroom, Launderette, and Chamber. The user needs to break this loop by choosing a different direction. Instead of continuing to go east or west, they should go south from the Chamber to proceed further in the game. This would be the correct action to avoid the loop and move towards the canteen.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

You are in a launderette. An usual one.



There is an open passageway leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

You find yourself in a washroom. A normal kind of place.

You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a dresser. What a letdown! The dresser is empty! If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a box. Now why would someone leave that there?

Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a bed stand. But the thing is empty. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! Hey, want to see a mantelpiece? Look over there, a mantelpiece. The mantelpiece is usual. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Hey, want to see a bar? Look over there, a bar. The bar is standard. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the bar! oh well.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

-= Chamber =-
You arrive in a chamber. A normal kind of place.

Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a bed stand. But the thing is empty. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! Hey, want to see a mantelpiece? Look over there, a mantelpiece. The mantelpiece is usual. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Hey, want to see a bar? Look over there, a bar. The bar is standard. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the bar! oh well.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.
