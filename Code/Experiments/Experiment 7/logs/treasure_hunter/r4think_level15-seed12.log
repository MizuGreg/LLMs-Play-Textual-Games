Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First stop, head north. With that accomplished, try to take a trip north. Then, move west. Then, make an attempt to head south. Then, go west. Once you get around to doing that, pick up the fly larva from the floor of the cookhouse. Got that? Good!

-= Bedroom =-
Well, here we are in the bedroom. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.



There is an unblocked exit to the north.

You're now in a shower.



There is an open door leading north. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

-= Cubicle =-
Well, here we are in a cubicle. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.



There is an open door leading south. There is an open gateway leading west.

GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Study =-
Of every study you could have walked into, you had to come round an usual one. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You see a locked coffer. You make out a trunk. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You scan the room for a stand, and you find a stand. The stand is typical. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is an open gateway leading east. There is an open gate leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

-= Vault =-
You make a grand eccentric entrance into a vault. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You see a suitcase. You make out a counter. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the counter.

You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the west.



>                                                                                                                                -= Vault =-0/5
THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to pick up the fly larva from the cookhouse. So far, the path taken has been: Bedroom → Shower → Cubicle → Study → Vault. The next step after the Vault is to go west, as per the initial instructions. But in the Vault, the available exits are north and west. Going west from the Vault would lead back to the Study? Wait, no. Let me check the previous steps again.

Wait, the user was told to go north from the Bedroom, then north again to the Shower, then west to the Cubicle, then south to the Study, then south again to the Vault. Now, in the Vault, the exits are north and west. Going north from the Vault would take them back to the Study, but the user needs to get to the cookhouse. Maybe the cookhouse is in a different direction. Alternatively, maybe the path requires moving east from the Study. But the Study had an east and west gateway. Wait, the Study's description said there's an open gateway leading east and west, and the user was told to go south from there to the Vault. So perhaps the cookhouse is in a different area. Wait, the initial instructions said to go north, then north again, then west, then south, then west again. Wait, the user's steps so far are:

1. Go north from Bedroom → Shower
2. Go north again → Cubicle
3. Go west → Study
4. Go south → Vault

But the initial instructions said after moving west from the cubicle (step 3), then move south (step 4), then go west again. Wait, the user's next step after the Vault is to go west. But in the Vault, the west exit is unguarded. So going west from Vault would take them back to the Study? Or maybe to another room. Wait, the Study's description said there's an open gateway leading east and west. So if the user is in the Vault and goes west, they might end up in the Study again. But that's a loop. So maybe the user needs to find another way.

Alternatively, perhaps the cookhouse is in the Study. The Study had a locked coffer, a trunk, and a stand. The user needs to pick up the fly larva from the cookhouse. Wait, the initial instruction said to pick up the fly larva from the floor of the cookhouse. So the user needs to reach the cookhouse. But so far, the user hasn't been to the cookhouse. The path taken so far hasn't included the cookhouse. So maybe the user needs to go east from the Study. The Study had an open gateway leading east. So from the Study, going east would take them to another room. But the user was told to go south from the Study to the Vault. So maybe the cookhouse is in a different part. Alternatively, maybe the user is in a loop between the Study and Vault. So the next step is to go east from the Study, but the user is currently in the Vault. So from the Vault, going west leads back to the Study. Then from the Study, going east might lead to the cookhouse. But the user hasn't tried that yet. So the next step would be to go east from the Study. But the user is in the Vault, so first go west to Study, then east. But the user's current location is the Vault. So the next action is to go west to the Study. Then from the Study, go east. But the user's previous steps didn't do that. So the user needs to go west from Vault to Study, then east from Study to reach the cookhouse. But the initial instructions said to go west again after moving south. Wait, the original instructions were: first go north, then north again, then west, then south, then west again. Wait, the user's steps so far are: Bedroom → Shower → Cubicle → Study → Vault. The next step after Vault is to go west, which would take them back to the Study. Then, from Study, go east. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action is to go west from Vault to Study, then east from Study. But the user is currently in the Vault, so the next action is go west. But the user is in the Vault, so the next step is to go west. However, the user might be in a loop here. So the user needs to find a different path. Alternatively, maybe the cookhouse is in the Study. But the Study had a locked coffer. Maybe the user needs to open it. But the user hasn't done that yet. Alternatively, the user needs to find the cookhouse through another route. But according to the initial instructions, the user was told to go west again after moving south. So maybe the user needs to go west from the Study. But the Study's description says there's an open gateway leading west. So from the Study, going west would take them back to the Cubicle. But that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe the cookhouse is in the Cubicle. But the Cubicle's description didn't mention it. Hmm. This is confusing. The user's goal is to pick up the fly larva from the cookhouse. So the user needs to reach the cookhouse. The current path is in the Vault. The user needs to find a way to get to the cookhouse. Maybe the cookhouse is in the Study. But the Study had a locked coffer. Maybe the user needs to open it. But the user hasn't tried that yet. Alternatively, the user might have to go east from the Study. So the next step is to go west from the Vault to the Study, then east from the Study. But the user is in the Vault, so the next action is go west. Then from Study, go east. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action is go west.

-= Cookhouse =-
You're now in the cookhouse.

You can make out a locked case, which looks usual, in the room.

There is an open portal leading north. There is an open hatch leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a fly larva on the floor.
