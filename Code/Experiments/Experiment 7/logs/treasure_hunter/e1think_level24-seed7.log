Welcome to another life changing round of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to try to head east. Okay, and then, try to go east. Then, go north. Once you get through with that, make an effort to go to the east. Once you accomplish that, try to head south. Following that, venture south. Then, go west. And then, go west. Then, retrieve the keycard from the saucepan. That's it!

-= Dish-Pit =-
You are in a dish-pit. An usual one.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an unguarded exit to the south. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

-= Vault =-
You are in a vault. A typical kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.



There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an unblocked exit to the south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and retrieve a keycard from a saucepan. The current location is the Vault, and the previous actions were going east from the Dish-Pit, then into the Vault.

The goal is to eventually get to the saucepan and retrieve the keycard. The user's instructions mention a series of directions: east, north, east again, south, south again, west, west again, then get the keycard. But the current room is the Vault, and the exits are east, south, and west. The user needs to follow the steps given.

Looking at the steps: after the initial east to the Vault, the next steps in the user's plan were to go north, then east, then south, south, west, west. But in the Vault, the exits are east, south, west. So maybe the user is supposed to go west from the Vault to avoid looping. But the user's previous action was going east from the Dish-Pit, then into the Vault. Now, the next step according to the initial plan was to go north, but in the Vault, the exits don't include north. The user might have gotten stuck in a loop between the Vault and the Dish-Pit.

Wait, the Dish-Pit had exits east, north, south, west. The Vault has east, south, west. So maybe the user is moving back and forth between these rooms. The initial plan was to go east, then north, then east, south, south, west, west. But in the Vault, going west would take them back to the Dish-Pit. Then from the Dish-Pit, going north would take them back to the Vault. So that's a loop.

The user needs to break the loop. Instead of repeating the same actions, maybe they need to find a different path. The keycard is in the saucepan, which is probably in a room that's accessible through the Vault's east exit. But the Vault's east exit is unblocked. So maybe the next step is to go east from the Vault to the next room, which might be the saucepan's location. But the user's plan was to go south, south, west, west. So perhaps the user needs to adjust their path to go east first, then find the saucepan.

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go west from the Vault to the Dish-Pit, then north to the Vault again, but that's looping. So the correct approach is to go east from the Vault to the next room, then proceed to get the keycard from the saucepan. The keycard is in the saucepan, so the user needs to find that room. The initial steps might have been misdirected, so the next action should be to go east from the Vault to reach the next room where the saucepan is.

-= Cubicle =-
You've just shown up in a cubicle. Let's see what's in here.

Were you looking for a toolbox? Because look over there, it's a toolbox. You can make out an armchair. The armchair is usual. However, the armchair, like an empty armchair, has nothing on it. You move on, clearly furious with TextWorld.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to follow a series of directions: go east, then east again, then north, then east, then south, then south again, then west, then west again, and finally retrieve the keycard from the saucepan.

Looking at the current environment, the user is in a cubicle. The previous actions were going east from the dish-pit, then east again to the vault, then east to the cubicle. Now, the cubicle has exits to east, north, south, and west. The user needs to continue following the steps: after the cubicle, the next step according to the original instructions was to go south. But in the cubicle, the exits include south. However, the user might be in a loop if moving east again doesn't lead to progress. But the original plan was to go east, then north, then east, then south, etc. Wait, the initial instructions said after getting through the first east, then north, then east again, then south, then south, then west, then west, then get the keycard.

But in the current cubicle, the user needs to go south as per the original plan. The cubicle's south exit is unblocked. So the next step should be south. But the user might have already tried that. Wait, the user's previous actions were: dish-pit east, vault east, cubicle east. Now, in the cubicle, the next step according to the original plan is to go south. So the next command should be south. But the user might be in a loop if moving east again doesn't help. However, the original plan says after the cubicle, go south. So the correct next step is south.

-= Bathroom =-
You find yourself in a bathroom. An ordinary kind of place. You can barely contain your excitement.

You can make out a locked dresser. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a drawer. What a letdown! The drawer is empty!

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. There is an unguarded exit to the north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in TextWorld, following a specific sequence of directions. The goal is to eventually retrieve the keycard from the saucepan.

First, I need to recall the initial instructions. The user was told to go east, then east again, then north, then east, south, west, and west again, and finally get the keycard from the saucepan. But the current room is a bathroom, and the previous actions led here.

Looking at the current room description: the user is in a bathroom. The exits mentioned are east (unguarded?), north (unguarded?), and west. The user needs to continue following the sequence. The next step in the original plan was to go south after venturing south, then west, then west again. But the user is now in the bathroom, so maybe the path has changed.

Wait, the user's past actions were: go east (from dish-pit to vault), then east again (from vault to cubicle?), then south (from cubicle to bathroom). Now, the next step in the original plan was to go south again, but in the bathroom, the exits are east, north, and west. The user needs to go south again, but the bathroom's description says there's an unguarded exit to the north and west. Wait, maybe the user is stuck in a loop here. The original plan was to go south from the cubicle, but that led to the bathroom. Now, from the bathroom, the user needs to go south again, but the bathroom's exits don't include south. Wait, the bathroom's description says "You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. There is an unguarded exit to the north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west." So south is not an exit here. That suggests that maybe the user is in a loop between the cubicle and bathroom. 

The original plan was to go east, east, north, east, south, west, west. But the user has already done east (dish-pit to vault), then east again (vault to cubicle?), then south (cubicle to bathroom). Now, from the bathroom, the next step in the original plan was to go south again, but that's not possible. So perhaps the user is stuck here. The user needs to find another way. Maybe the keycard is in the bathroom? The dresser is locked, but the drawer is empty. Maybe the keycard is in the bathroom, but the user needs to find it. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west from the bathroom, which is unblocked. Let's check the previous steps. The user was told to go south from the cubicle, which led to the bathroom. Now, from the bathroom, the next step in the original plan was to go south again, but that's not possible. So maybe the user needs to go west from the bathroom. But the original plan was to go south, then west, then west. So perhaps the user is in a loop here. The user needs to break the loop by trying a different action. Instead of going south again, which isn't possible, maybe go west. The user should try west from the bathroom. That would be the next step. So the next action is west.

-= Scullery =-
You find yourself in a scullery. A normal one. The room is well lit.

You can see a chest. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a saucepan. The saucepan is usual. On the saucepan you can see a keycard.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to follow a specific sequence of movements and retrieve the keycard from the saucepan. So far, they've gone east from the dish-pit, then east again into the vault, then south to the cubicle, west to the bathroom, and then west again to the scullery. Now, in the scullery, they see the saucepan with the keycard on it. The next step is to pick up the keycard.

Looking at the current room description, the scullery has exits to east, north, and west. The keycard is on the saucepan, which is in the room. The user needs to retrieve it. Since the keycard is already in the scullery, the next action should be to take the keycard from the saucepan. The previous actions have already moved through the necessary locations, so the final step is to collect the keycard here. The command should be "take keycard from saucepan" or something similar. But the system might expect a specific command format. Since the user is in the scullery and the keycard is on the saucepan, the correct action is to take it. The previous steps have already handled the movement, so this is the final step.
