Welcome to TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First, it would be a great idea if you could attempt to head south. With that done, make an effort to take a trip west. Then, travel south. With that over with, make an effort to venture east. And then, move east. Then, pick-up the passkey from the floor of the bar. That's it!

You find yourself in a cookhouse. A standard one.

You can see a closed chest in the corner. You see a counter. The counter is ordinary. But the thing is empty. Hm. Oh well

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a TextWorld game and needs to follow specific steps to reach the passkey in the bar. The initial instructions were to go south, then west, then south again, then east, then east again, and finally pick up the passkey.

Looking at the current location, the user is in the Laundromat. The previous steps have taken them through the Cookhouse, Studio, Scullery, and Chamber. Now, they're in the Laundromat. The next step according to the original plan was to go east again. But the user has already gone east from the Chamber to the Laundromat. The next step after that was to go east again, but maybe that's not possible. Alternatively, they might need to check for the passkey here or navigate elsewhere.

Wait, the original task said to "pick-up the passkey from the floor of the bar." So the user needs to find the bar. The current location is the Laundromat. The exits here are east, north, south, west. The user needs to find the bar. Maybe the bar is in a different room. The user should check the exits again. The Laundromat's exits are east, north, south, west. The user might need to go north or south to reach the bar. Alternatively, maybe the passkey is in the Laundromat, but the user hasn't checked the floor yet. However, the original plan said to go east twice, then pick up the passkey. But the user is in the Laundromat now. Let me check the previous steps again.

Original steps: go south (Cookhouse), then west (Studio), then south (Scullery), then east (Chamber), then east (Laundromat). Then pick up the passkey. But the user is in the Laundromat. The next step would be to go east again? But the Laundromat's east exit is unguarded. Wait, the user might have already gone east twice. Maybe the bar is in the next room. Alternatively, the passkey is in the Laundromat. The user needs to check the floor here. But the user hasn't picked up anything yet. The current room's description mentions a bench, but it's empty. The user needs to check if the passkey is here. If not, maybe go north or south to find the bar. The user's next action should be to check the floor for the passkey or move towards the bar.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Laundromat again, having cycled through several rooms. The goal is to pick up the passkey from the bar. The original plan was to go south, west, south, east, east, then get the passkey. But the user is stuck in a loop between the Laundromat and Studio, Scullery, etc.

First, the goal is to reach the bar and pick up the passkey. So far, the user has gone through several rooms but hasn't found the bar yet. The next step should be to find the bar. However, the current location is the Laundromat, and the exits are east, north, south, west. The user needs to check if the bar is in one of these directions. But the previous steps didn't lead to the bar. Maybe the user needs to go north from the Laundromat to reach the bar. Alternatively, maybe the passkey is in the Laundromat, but the user hasn't checked the floor. However, the original instructions said to go east twice, so maybe the user needs to go east again from the Laundromat. But the user is already in the Laundromat, and the previous action was going east, which led back to the Studio. So perhaps the user is in a loop and needs to try a different direction. The next action should be to go north from the Laundromat to escape the loop and find the bar.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Scullery, Studio, and Attic. The goal is to pick up the passkey from the bar. The original plan was to go south, west, south, east, east, then get the passkey. But the user is repeatedly cycling through these rooms without finding the bar.

First, the goal is to reach the bar and collect the passkey. So far, the user hasn't found the bar yet. The next step should be to find the bar. However, the current location is the Attic, which has an exit to the south. The user needs to go south from the Attic to escape the loop and find the bar. The previous actions didn't lead to the bar, so maybe the user needs to go south again from the Attic.

-= Studio =-
You find yourself in a studio. A typical one. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You make out a locked toolbox nearby. You can make out a closed bureau.

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the south. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

You find yourself in a cookhouse. A standard one.

You can see a closed chest in the corner. You see a counter. The counter is ordinary. But the thing is empty. Hm. Oh well

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

-= Studio =-
You find yourself in a studio. A typical one. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You make out a locked toolbox nearby. You can make out a closed bureau.

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the south. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

-= Scullery =-
You arrive in a scullery. Let's see what's in here.

Look over there! a case. You look around you, at all the containers and supporters, doors and objects, and you think to yourself. Why? Why Textworld? You can see a fridge. The fridge is empty! What a waste of a day!

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

-= Attic =-
You've entered an attic.

You scan the room, seeing a trunk. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. What a letdown! The trunk is empty!

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.
