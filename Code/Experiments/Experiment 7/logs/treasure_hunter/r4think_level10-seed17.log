You are now playing a life changing game of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. Your first objective is to attempt to move north. And then, make an effort to venture north. After that, make an effort to go to the east. After that, go to the south. Following that, pick-up the passkey from the floor of the chamber. And once you've done that, you win!

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and collect a passkey. The current goal is to move north, then north again, then east, south, pick up the passkey, and win.

Looking at the history, the user started in the studio, went north to the laundromat, then north again to the shower, then south back to the laundromat. Now they're back in the laundromat again. The next step according to the original plan was to go east, but the user hasn't done that yet. However, the current room is the laundromat, and the previous action was going south, which brought them back. The user might be stuck in a loop between the laundromat and shower.

The next step should be to go east from the shower, but since they're in the laundromat now, maybe they need to check if there's an east exit here. But the laundromat's description says to go north or south. Wait, the original plan was after going north (to laundromat), then north again (to shower), then south (back to laundromat), then east. But the laundromat doesn't have an east exit mentioned. So maybe the user needs to go east from the shower, but they were in the shower, then went south back to laundromat. Now they're in laundromat again. Maybe the correct path is from the laundromat, go north again to shower, then east. But the user needs to pick up the passkey in the chamber. Wait, the original instructions say after going south, pick up the passkey from the floor of the chamber. So maybe the chamber is the laundromat? Or another room?

Wait, the initial task was: move north (studio to laundromat), then north again (laundromat to shower), then east (from shower?), then south (back to laundromat?), then pick up passkey. But the passkey is in the chamber. Maybe the laundromat is the chamber? Or maybe the shower is the chamber? The user needs to find the passkey in the chamber. The current room is laundromat, which has a towel on the floor. The passkey isn't here. So maybe the user needs to go east from the shower, which is the next step. But in the shower room, the exits are east and south. So after being in the shower, go east. Then, from there, maybe go south to laundromat, then pick up the passkey. But the user is currently in laundromat again. So the next step should be to go north again to shower, then east. But the user has to make sure not to loop. Since they were in laundromat, maybe the correct next step is to go east, but if that's not possible, then north. But the laundromat's description says to go north or south. So perhaps the user needs to go north again to shower, then east. Then, after that, go south to laundromat, pick up the passkey. But the passkey is in the chamber, which might be the laundromat. So the user needs to check if the passkey is in the laundromat. But in the laundromat, there's a towel on the floor. So maybe the passkey is in the shower? Or another room. The user needs to follow the steps: after going south, pick up the passkey. So maybe after going south from the shower to laundromat, the passkey is there. But the user hasn't picked it up yet. So the next action should be to pick up the passkey. But the user is in laundromat, and the passkey is on the floor. So the correct next step is to pick up the passkey. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action is to pick up the passkey. But the user's previous actions were moving around, and now they need to collect the passkey. So the next command should be to pick up the passkey.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to navigate through the rooms in order: north, then north again, then east, south, pick up the passkey, and win. So far, they've gone from studio to laundromat, then to shower, then back to laundromat. Now they're in the shower again. The next step according to the original plan was to go east from the shower. But when they tried going east, it wasn't possible. Then they went north again, which brought them back to the shower.

Wait, the current room is the shower. The description says to try going east or south. The user tried east and couldn't, then went north again. But they need to go east from the shower. Maybe the correct action is to go east despite the message saying "you need an unblocked exit"? Or maybe the user is stuck in a loop between shower and laundromat. The passkey is in the chamber, which might be the laundromat. But when they were in laundromat, they couldn't find the passkey. So maybe they need to go east from the shower, even if the message says to try south. Alternatively, maybe the passkey is in the shower. But the user hasn't picked it up yet. The next step should be to go east from the shower, even if it's not allowed, or find another way. But the user has to follow the steps strictly. The original plan was after going south, pick up the passkey. So maybe after going east from shower, then south to laundromat, then pick up the passkey. But the user is in the shower now. The next action should be to go east, even if it's not possible, or find another exit. But the system says "you can't go that way." So maybe the correct action is to go south from the shower, which is allowed. Then go to laundromat, then pick up the passkey. But the user needs to make sure they don't loop. So the next action is to go south from the shower.

You arrive in a laundromat. A standard one. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

There is a towel on the floor.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

-= Laundromat =-
You arrive in a laundromat. A standard one. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

There is a towel on the floor.
