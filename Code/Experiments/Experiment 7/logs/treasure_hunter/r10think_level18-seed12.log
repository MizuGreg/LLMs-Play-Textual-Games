Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First thing I need you to do is to attempt to venture north. Following that, ensure that the door is open. If you have pulled open the door, try to go north. If you can accomplish that, ensure that the gateway inside the cubicle is open. Then, go to the west. And then, make an attempt to go south. After that, move west. Next, pick up the fly larva from the floor of the cookhouse. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Bedroom =-
Well, here we are in the bedroom. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.



There is an unblocked exit to the north.

You scan the room for a stand, and you find a stand. The stand is typical. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user wants me to figure out the next step in the game. The goal is to pick up the fly larva from the cookhouse and win. So far, the player has navigated through the bedroom, shower, cubicle, study, and vault. They've opened doors and gateways where necessary. Now, they're in the vault, and the next step is to find the cookhouse.

Looking at the current location, the vault has a suitcase and a counter. The exits are north and west. The user needs to get to the cookhouse. Since the cookhouse hasn't been mentioned yet, maybe the next step is to go north from the vault. The vault's north exit is unblocked, so going there makes sense. Then, from the cookhouse, pick up the fly larva. But wait, the user hasn't reached the cookhouse yet. So the immediate next action is to go north from the vault to reach the cookhouse. Then, once there, pick up the larva. But the current step is to go north.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Study and Vault rooms. The goal is to pick up the fly larva from the cookhouse. So far, the player has been moving back and forth between these two rooms without making progress.

First, the goal steps are: venture north, open doors/gateways, reach the cookhouse, pick up the larva. But the current path isn't leading to the cookhouse. The Study and Vault rooms don't mention the cookhouse. Maybe the cookhouse is in a different part of the map.

The player has been going south from Vault to Study and back. That's a loop. To break it, they need to find another exit. The Study has a gateway east and west, but those don't lead to the cookhouse. The Vault has a west exit, but that's back to the Study. Maybe the cookhouse is through another path not yet explored.

Alternatively, maybe the cookhouse is in the Study room. The Study has a locked coffer and a trunk. Perhaps the fly larva is in the coffer or trunk. But the user hasn't checked those yet. The instruction says to pick up the larva from the floor of the cookhouse, so maybe the cookhouse is another room.

Wait, the initial steps required going to the cookhouse. But the player hasn't reached it yet. The current location is Study, which doesn't mention the cookhouse. So maybe the cookhouse is through the east gateway in the Study. Let me check the Study description again. The Study has an open gateway east and west. The east gateway might lead to a different area. If the cookhouse is east of the Study, then going east would be the next step. But the user has been going south and north, looping. So the next action should be to go east from the Study to find the cookhouse. That's the key to breaking the loop and progressing towards the goal.

SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user needs to pick up the fly larva from the cookhouse. So far, they've been moving between rooms without finding the cookhouse. The current location is the Cubicle, which has a door south and a gateway west. The previous attempts to go east from the Study led back to the Cubicle.

The goal steps are: venture north, open doors/gateways, reach the cookhouse, pick up the larva. But the user hasn't reached the cookhouse yet. The loop is between the Study, Vault, Cubicle, and Shower. The next step should be to check the west gateway in the Cubicle, which might lead to a different area. Alternatively, maybe the cookhouse is through another exit. Since the user tried going east and it looped, maybe trying a different direction like west from the Cubicle. But the Cubicle's west gateway was already explored. Wait, the Study's east gateway led to the Cubicle. Maybe the cookhouse is in the Study's east direction, but that's where the Cubicle is. Hmm. The user needs to find the cookhouse, which hasn't been mentioned yet. Maybe the cookhouse is in the Vault? But the Vault doesn't mention it. Alternatively, the fly larva is in the locked coffer or trunk in the Study. But the user hasn't checked those. However, the instruction says to pick it from the cookhouse's floor. So the cookhouse must be another room. The user needs to find the cookhouse, which might be through the east gateway from the Study. But that led to the Cubicle. Maybe the cookhouse is in the Shower? But the Shower doesn't mention it. This is confusing. The user is stuck in a loop, so the next action should be to try a different direction, like west from the Cubicle, even if it's been done before, to break the loop. Alternatively, check the locked coffer in the Study for the larva, even though the instruction says it's in the cookhouse. Maybe there's a mistake in the game's setup. But according to the instructions, the user must pick it from the cookhouse. So the correct next step is to go west from the Cubicle, even if it's a loop, to find the cookhouse.
