Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First step, go to the south. Okay, and then, go to the east. If you can finish that, make an effort to take a trip north. And then, try to venture north. Once you finish that, make an attempt to head east. Following that, recover the latchkey from the pan in the cookhouse. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Recreation Zone =-
You've entered a recreation zone.



There is an open passageway leading north. There is an open hatch leading south.

-= Laundry Place =-
You have walked into a laundry place. Not the laundry place you'd expect. No, this is a laundry place. You begin looking for stuff.

You can see an opened cabinet, which looks ordinary, in the corner. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You make out a table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

There is an open portal leading east. There is an open hatch leading north.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a TextWorld game and needs to follow specific steps to reach the goal. The initial instructions were to go south, then east, north, east again, find the latchkey in the cookhouse, and then stop. But the current environment is the Laundry Place, which is part of the game's layout.

First, I need to recall the goal: the user has to navigate through different areas, perform specific actions, and retrieve the latchkey from the cookhouse. The current location is the Laundry Place, which has a portal east and a hatch north. The previous action was going south from the Recreation Zone to the Laundry Place.

The user's next step, according to the initial instructions, was to go east. But in the current setup, the Laundry Place has an open portal leading east. So the next logical step is to go east. However, the user might be stuck in a loop if they keep moving between the same areas without progress. But since the goal includes moving east again, perhaps after navigating through the Laundry Place, they can proceed east to the next area.

Wait, the user's previous action was going south, then they are in the Laundry Place. The next step in the original instructions was to go east. So the correct next action here is to go east. But the user might be in a loop if they keep moving between the same areas. However, the game's layout suggests that each area is connected, so moving east from the Laundry Place would take them to another location, perhaps the Cookhouse or another area. The latchkey is in the cookhouse, so the user needs to navigate to there.

So the next step is to go east from the Laundry Place. The user's past actions are: go south (from Recreation Zone to Laundry Place), then go east (from Laundry Place to next area). Then, according to the original instructions, after that, they need to go north, then east again, then find the latchkey. But the current step is to go east from the Laundry Place. So the next command should be "go east".

-= Bedroom =-
Guess what, you are in a place we're calling a bedroom. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.



There is an open gate leading north. There is an open portal leading west.

There is a loaf of bread on the floor.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in TextWorld. The goal is to follow a series of directions: go south, then east, then north, then east again, and finally recover the latchkey from the pan in the cookhouse.

So far, the user started by going south from the Recreation Zone to the Laundry Place. Then they went east to the Bedroom. Now, in the Bedroom, there's a loaf of bread on the floor, but no mention of the cookhouse or the latchkey. The next step according to the initial instructions was to take a trip north from the Bedroom. But the user hasn't done that yet.

Wait, the user's previous action was "go east" from the Laundry Place to the Bedroom. Now, in the Bedroom, the available directions are north and west. The user needs to go north from here. But the initial plan was after going east once, then venture north again. However, the user might be getting stuck in a loop if they keep moving between rooms without making progress towards the cookhouse.

The goal is to recover the latchkey from the pan in the cookhouse. So maybe the user needs to find the cookhouse first. But the current rooms are Recreation Zone → Laundry Place → Bedroom. The cookhouse hasn't been encountered yet. The user needs to find a way to get to the cookhouse. 

Looking at the directions in the Bedroom: there's a gate leading north and a portal west. Going west would take them back to the Laundry Place. Going north from the Bedroom would be the next step as per the initial plan. But if that leads to another room, maybe the cookhouse is there. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west to the Laundry Place again and then find another path.

But the user's next action should be to go north from the Bedroom. However, if that leads to a loop, they might need to try a different direction. But according to the initial instructions, after going east once, they should venture north. So the next step is to go north from the Bedroom. Let me check the previous steps again.

Original instructions: go south, then east, then north, then east, then recover the latchkey. So after the first east (to Laundry Place), then north to the Bedroom. Then the next step is to go east again? Wait, no. The initial instructions say after going south, then east, then north, then east. Wait, maybe the user needs to go north from the Recreation Zone, then east, then north again, then east again. But the user has already gone south from Recreation Zone to Laundry Place, then east to Bedroom. So maybe the next step is to go north from Bedroom to the next room, which might be the cookhouse or another area. But the user hasn't reached the cookhouse yet. So the next action should be to go north from the Bedroom. If that leads to the cookhouse, then they can look for the pan and latchkey. If not, maybe they need to explore further. But according to the initial plan, after the first east, they should go north again. So the next step is to go north from the Bedroom.

-= Bathroom =-
You find yourself in a bathroom. A standard kind of place.

Were you looking for a board? Because look over there, it's a board. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is an open gateway leading north. There is an open gate leading south.

So far, the user has gone south from the recreation zone to the laundry place, then east to the bedroom, then north to the bathroom. The next step according to the initial instructions was to try to venture north again. But in the bathroom, there's a gateway leading north and a gate leading south. The user might be stuck in a loop between the bathroom and the previous rooms.

The user's past actions have been moving through the rooms, but they haven't yet reached the cookhouse. The next step should be to continue moving north from the bathroom. However, if that leads back to a previous room, maybe they need to try a different direction. But according to the current room description, the bathroom has a north gateway and a south gate. The user was in the bathroom, so going north would take them to the next room. The next step is to go north again. But the user might be in a loop if they keep going back and forth. However, the initial instructions say to go north after the previous steps. So the next action should be to go north again.

-= Cubicle =-
I am sorry to announce that you are now in the cubicle.

You see a coffer. You make out an opened trunk. The trunk is empty! What a waste of a day!

There is an open gateway leading south. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east.

Looking at the current location, the user is in the Cubicle. The previous steps have been moving north from the Bathroom, then to the Cubicle. The next step mentioned in the original instructions was to venture north again, but the user has already been moving north多次. Now, the Cubicle has an open gateway leading south and suggests trying east.

The user's past actions include going south, east, north, north again. The next step according to the original plan was to take a trip north, but that might not be progressing. The current location's description mentions trying east. The goal is to get to the cookhouse and retrieve the latchkey. So, maybe the next step is to go east from the Cubicle. The user needs to check if moving east is the correct direction towards the cookhouse. Since the previous actions have been moving north and south, perhaps east is the next logical step to progress towards the cookhouse. The user should go east.

-= Cookhouse =-
Wow! You're in a cookhouse. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You make out a pan. The pan is ordinary. On the pan you see a latchkey. You scan the room, seeing a bowl. However, the bowl, like an empty bowl, has nothing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the bowl.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

So far, the user has navigated through the Recreation Zone, Laundry Place, Bedroom, Bathroom, Cubicle, and now the Cookhouse.

In the Cookhouse, the user found the latchkey on the pan. The next step according to the initial instructions was to "recover the latchkey from the pan in the cookhouse." Since the user is already here and the latchkey is present, the next action should be to take the latchkey. The previous actions were moving around, and now the objective is to pick up the item. The command should be "take latchkey" to complete that step. Then, after retrieving it, the user can stop as per the instructions. So the next command is to take the latchkey.
