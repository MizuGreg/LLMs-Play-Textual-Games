You are now playing a exciting game of TextWorld! First of all, you could, like, make an effort to head east. With that over with, make an effort to venture south. Okay, and then, try to venture west. And then, recover the fondue from the floor of the studio. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Dish-Pit =-
You're now in a dish-pit.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

-= Studio =-
A rusty sign tells you that you are now in the studio. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

There is a fondue on the floor.
