You are now playing a fast paced episode of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First stop, head north. After that, try to go west. Then, move west. With that over with, head west. Then, take the sandwich from the table within the kitchen. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Workshop =-
You arrive in a workshop. An ordinary kind of place. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

You make out a stand. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an unguarded exit to the south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

-= Bathroom =-
I never took you for the sort of person who would show up in a bathroom, but I guess I was wrong. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You see a board. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an unblocked exit to the south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is playing a text adventure game where they need to follow specific steps to win. The goal is to first go north, then west twice, then west again, take a sandwich from the kitchen, and win.

Looking at the current environment, the user is in the Bathroom. The previous action was "go north" which led them here from the Workshop. Now, the next steps according to the initial instructions are to go west three times (since after going north, the next steps are west, west, west). But in the Bathroom, the available exits are south and west. The user needs to go west from here. However, the initial instruction said after going north, try to go west, then move west again, then west again. Wait, the original task said: first stop, head north. Then try to go west. Then move west. With that over with, head west. So that's three wests after the first north. But maybe the user has already done some of those steps.

Wait, the user's first action was "go north" which took them from Workshop to Bathroom. Now, in the Bathroom, the next step is to go west. But the user's next action should be to go west. However, the current prompt says that in the Bathroom, there's an unblocked exit to the south and west. So the user needs to go west from here. But according to the initial plan, after going north, they need to go west three times. So from the Bathroom, going west would be the first of those three. Then, from whatever room they end up in, they need to go west again, then again. But maybe the user is in a loop here. Wait, but the user hasn't taken the sandwich yet. The sandwich is in the kitchen. So the user needs to get to the kitchen, take the sandwich, then win.

But the current location is the Bathroom. The initial plan was to go north (done), then west, west, west. So from the Bathroom, going west would be the first step. But the user needs to check if that's possible. The Bathroom's west exit is unblocked, so they can go west. Then, from there, maybe they end up in another room. Let's say they go west from Bathroom, then maybe they reach the Kitchen. Then they can take the sandwich. But the user's next action should be to go west. However, the user might be in a loop if they keep going west and not making progress. But according to the current state, the user is in the Bathroom, and the next step is to go west. So the correct next action is "go west".

You're now in the scullery.



There is an open hatch leading south. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the east.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in a text adventure game. The goal is to follow specific directions: first go north, then west twice, then west again, then take a sandwich from the kitchen, and win.

So far, the user started by going north from the workshop to the bathroom. Then they went west to the scullery. Now, the next step according to the original instructions was to move west again. But the current location is the scullery, which has an open hatch south, a wooden door west, and an exit east. The user's next move should be west again, but maybe there's a loop here. Wait, the user has already gone west once from the bathroom to the scullery. The original plan was after going north (workshop to bathroom), then try to go west (bathroom to scullery), then move west again (scullery to maybe another room?), but the scullery's west door is a wooden door. Maybe that leads to another room. But the user needs to get to the kitchen to take the sandwich. So perhaps after scullery, going west would lead to the kitchen. But the user hasn't taken the sandwich yet. So the next step is to go west from scullery, then check if the kitchen is there. Then take the sandwich. But the user's last action was going west to scullery. The next step should be to go west again from scullery. But maybe the user is in a loop? Wait, the original instructions said after going north, try to go west, then move west again, then west again. So maybe the user has done north (workshop to bathroom), then west (bathroom to scullery), then another west (scullery to kitchen?), then another west? But the scullery's west is a door. So maybe the next step is to go west again from scullery. But the user might be stuck in a loop if moving west from scullery doesn't lead to the kitchen. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check the exits again. But according to the current room description, scullery has an open hatch south, a wooden door west, and exit east. So going west from scullery would be the next step. The user's next action should be go west again. But the user might have already done that. Wait, the user's previous action was go west to scullery. The next step in the original plan was to move west again. So the next command should be go west. But the user might be in a loop if that doesn't lead to the kitchen. However, the user needs to follow the steps as per the original instructions. So the next action is go west again.

-= Shower =-
You're now in the shower. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

You make out a drawer. You see a case. The case is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You make out a dresser.

There is an open wooden door leading east. There is an open stone hatch leading west.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in a text adventure game. The goal is to follow specific directions: first go north, then west twice, then west again, then take a sandwich from the kitchen, and win.

So far, the user has gone north from the workshop to the bathroom, then west to the scullery, then west again to the shower. Now they're in the shower, and the next step according to the initial instructions is to take the sandwich from the kitchen. But the current room is the shower, which doesn't mention a kitchen. So the user needs to find the kitchen.

Looking at the previous rooms: the scullery had an exit to the east, which would lead back to the bathroom, and the bathroom had an exit to the south (workshop) and west (scullery). The shower has an exit east to the scullery and west to the stone hatch. Maybe the stone hatch leads to another area. But the user needs to get to the kitchen. Maybe the kitchen is in the workshop? Wait, the initial instruction says to take the sandwich from the kitchen. The workshop had a stand, but nothing on it. The bathroom had a board, scullery has a hatch, shower has a drawer and case. Maybe the kitchen is in the workshop? But the user hasn't checked there yet. Alternatively, maybe the kitchen is in the scullery or shower. But the user needs to find the kitchen.

Wait, the initial instructions said after going west three times (north, west, west, west?), but the user has gone north, west, west, and now is in the shower. Maybe the next step is to go east from the shower back to the scullery, then east again to the bathroom, then south to the workshop, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe the stone hatch west from the shower leads to a different area. But the user needs to find the kitchen. Since the initial plan was to go north, then west, then west, then west, but the user is in the shower after three west steps. Maybe the kitchen is in the scullery? But the scullery's description doesn't mention a kitchen. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east from the shower to the scullery, then east again to the bathroom, then south to the workshop, but that's not helpful. Wait, the initial task was to go north, then west, then west, then west. But the user is in the shower after three west steps. Maybe the next step is to go east from the shower to the scullery, then east again to the bathroom, then south to the workshop, but that's not leading to the kitchen. Alternatively, maybe the kitchen is in the workshop, but the workshop's stand is empty. The user needs to take the sandwich from the kitchen, so the kitchen must be in one of the rooms. Since the user hasn't found it yet, maybe they need to explore other exits. The shower has a stone hatch west, which might lead to a different area. But the user hasn't checked that. So the next action should be to go west from the shower through the stone hatch, then check if that leads to the kitchen. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east from the shower to the scullery, then check for the kitchen there. But the scullery's description doesn't mention a kitchen. Maybe the user needs to go back to the bathroom, then east to the scullery, then east to the workshop, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe the kitchen is in the scullery, and the user needs to check there. But the scullery's description doesn't mention a kitchen. Hmm, this is confusing. The user's next step should be to find the kitchen. Since the initial plan was to go west three times, but the user is in the shower, maybe the next step is to go east back to the scullery, then check for the kitchen. But the scullery's description doesn't mention a kitchen. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west from the shower through the stone hatch, which might lead to a different room. The user should try that. So the next action is to go west.

-= Kitchen =-
You've entered a kitchen. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a table. You see a sandwich on the table.

There is an open stone hatch leading east. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing a text adventure game. The goal is to follow specific steps: first go north, then west, then west again, then west once more, and finally take the sandwich from the kitchen table to win.

Looking at the current state, the user has just entered the Kitchen. The previous actions were moving north, then west, then west again, and then west again. Wait, but the initial instructions said after going north, try to go west, then move west again, then head west again. So that's three west moves after the initial north. But in the current location, the user is in the Kitchen. The next step according to the goal is to take the sandwich from the table in the kitchen. 

In the current room (Kitchen), there's a sandwich on the table. The user needs to pick it up. The previous actions have already led them here. The next step is to take the sandwich. The user's last action was moving west, which brought them to the Kitchen. Now, they need to take the sandwich. The command should be "take sandwich" or "take the sandwich". But the game might require the exact phrasing. Since the prompt says "take the sandwich from the table within the kitchen", the correct command is "take sandwich" as the table is implied. So the next action is to take the sandwich.
