It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First stop, venture north. And then, head east. With that over with, attempt to travel north. And then, make an effort to venture west. After that, make an attempt to head north. And then, head east. Following that, make an effort to take a trip east. Then, move south. After that, go to the south. And then, make an effort to move south. After that, recover the shadfly from the floor of the laundromat. Got that? Good!

SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a TextWorld game, and their goal is to recover the shadfly from the laundromat floor. The current location is the Cookery, where they smell a great smell and see a refrigerator. The previous actions were going north from the shower, then east, then north again, then east, then south, and then south again. Now they're in the Cookery.

First, I need to recall the goal: find the shadfly in the laundromat. The user has been moving around, but maybe they haven't found the right path yet. The current location is the Cookery, which might not be the laundromat. The next step would be to figure out how to get to the laundromat. The previous actions involved moving north, east, south, etc., but maybe they're stuck in a loop.

Looking at the environment, the Cookery has exits to east, north, and south. The user tried going east, north, and south. The refrigerator is empty, and the light flickers but nothing else happens. Maybe the laundromat is in a different direction. The user needs to find the correct path to the laundromat. Since they've been moving around without success, they might be in a loop. To break the loop, they need to try a different direction or action. The exit to the east from the shower was unguarded, but in the Cookery, maybe the exit to the south is the way to go. Alternatively, maybe the refrigerator has something, but it's empty. Wait, the user needs to recover the shadfly from the laundromat floor, so maybe they need to go to the laundromat and check the floor. But how to get there?

The previous steps were: north from shower, east, north, east, south, south. Now in Cookery. Maybe the next step is to go east again from Cookery. But the user tried that before. Alternatively, check the refrigerator for clues. But it's empty. Maybe the correct path is to go south from Cookery. The prompt says "You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south." So maybe going south from Cookery is the next step. That would take them back towards the shower area. But they need to reach the laundromat. Alternatively, maybe the laundromat is in the east direction. But the user needs to find the right path. Since the previous actions didn't lead to progress, maybe they need to try a different direction. The user should try going east again from Cookery. But the problem is that they might be stuck in a loop. So the next action should be to go east again, but using a synonym if needed. However, the user's previous action was going east, so maybe they need to try a different direction. Alternatively, check the refrigerator again. But it's empty. Maybe the correct path is to go south from Cookery. Let's check the prompt again. The user is in the Cookery, and the options are east, north, south. The prompt says "You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south." So the user should try going south. That would be the next step. So the next action is go south.

Okay, let's try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game called TextWorld, and they've been given a series of directions. The goal seems to be to navigate through different areas and eventually recover the shadfly from the laundromat.

Looking at the history, the user started by going north, then east, west, north again, east, south, and then back to the shower. Now they're back in the shower area, which they've been in before. The prompt mentions that the exit is to the east and suggests going north again. But the user is stuck in a loop between the shower and cookery areas.

The user's past actions include moving north, east, west, south, and back. The next step should be to find a way out of the loop. Since the exit is east from the shower, maybe going east is the way to go. But the previous attempt to go east led back to the cookery. However, the cookery area has an exit to the south, which might lead back to the shower again. So, the user is stuck in a loop between shower and cookery.

The goal is to recover the shadfly from the laundromat. The user hasn't found the shadfly yet. Maybe the shadfly is in the laundromat, which is a different area. The user needs to navigate to the laundromat. But the current path seems to be looping between shower and cookery. The exit to the east from the shower might lead to another area, but the user hasn't explored that yet.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to find a different path. Since the cookery has an exit to the south, which leads back to the shower, but the shower has an exit to the east. Maybe the user should try going east from the shower again, even though it's been done before. But the game might have a different path there.

Wait, the user's last action was going south from the cookery, which brought them back to the shower. Now, in the shower, the exit is east. So, the user should go east again. But the previous attempt to go east from the shower led to the cookery, which then led back to the shower. So, maybe the user needs to go east again, but that's the same as before. However, the user might need to find a different route.

Alternatively, maybe the user should try going north from the shower again, as the prompt suggests. But the shower's north exit is unguarded. However, the user is already in the shower, and the previous steps have led them back here. The key is to find the laundromat and recover the shadfly. The user needs to find the correct path to the laundromat, which might be through the cookery or another area.

Since the user is stuck in a loop, the next step should be to try a different action. The previous actions of going north and south have not worked. Maybe the user should try going east again from the shower, even though it's been done before, but perhaps there's a different path there. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to look for other exits or items in the current area.

In the shower, the exit is east. So, the next action should be to go east. Even though it's been done before, maybe the user needs to proceed that way to reach the laundromat. The user's goal is to recover the shadfly, so the correct path is to go east from the shower, then proceed through the cookery, and eventually reach the laundromat.

Well, here we are in the kitchenette.

A locked freezer is here. You can make out a fridge. The fridge is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You can make out a chair. The chair is usual. The chair appears to be empty. Hm. Oh well You make out a rack. The rack appears to be empty. Hopefully, this discovery doesn't ruin your TextWorld experience!

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

Okay, let's try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game called TextWorld, and their goal seems to be to recover the shadfly from the floor of the laundromat. The previous interactions show that the player has been moving around different rooms: starting in the shower, then the cookery, then the kitchenette. The instructions mention a sequence of directions: north, east, west, north, east, east, south, south, and then finally recovering the shadfly.

Looking at the current scene, the user is in the Kitchenette. The description mentions a locked freezer, a fridge (which is empty), a chair, a rack. The exit to the east is unblocked, and the suggestion is to go west. The user's previous actions included going north, east, south, and east again. Now, the next step might be to check the west direction. However, the user might be stuck in a loop if they keep moving between rooms without making progress towards the shadfly.

The goal is to find the shadfly in the laundromat's floor. So far, the player hasn't found it. The current room is the Kitchenette. The exit to the east is unblocked, but the user might need to explore other rooms. However, the previous steps suggest that moving west might be the next direction. But if moving west leads back to a previous room, the player might be looping. So, maybe the next action should be to check the west direction again, but if that's not working, perhaps there's another way. Alternatively, maybe the shadfly is in the fridge or on the chair, but the fridge is empty. The rack is also empty. So maybe the shadfly is in the laundromat, which the player hasn't reached yet. The player needs to navigate through the rooms to get to the laundromat. The previous steps included moving east and south, so maybe the next step is to go west again, but the user needs to avoid looping. Alternatively, maybe the correct path is to go east again from the Kitchenette. But the hint says to go west. So the next action should be west. However, if that's leading back, maybe the player needs to try a different direction. But according to the instructions, the next step after the Kitchenette is to go west. So the answer should be "go west".

Okay, let's try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game called TextWorld, and they've been moving around different rooms like a shower, cookery, kitchenette, etc. The goal mentioned earlier was to recover the shadfly from the floor of the laundromat.

Looking at the current situation, the user is back in the shower again after moving west from the kitchenette. The prompt says there's an exit to the east and suggests going north. The previous actions have been going back and forth between rooms, possibly looping.

The user's task is to navigate to the laundromat's floor and retrieve the shadfly. So far, they've been in the shower, cookery, kitchenette, and back to the shower. The next step should be to find the laundromat. Since the exit to the east is mentioned in the shower, maybe that's the way to go. But the user has been going north and west, which might not be leading them towards the laundromat.

Wait, the initial instructions said to go north, then east, then west, then north, then east, then south, etc. But the user is stuck in a loop between shower and kitchenette. Maybe they need to find a different path. The key is to avoid repeating the same actions. Since going east from the shower is unguarded, maybe that's the exit to the laundromat. Alternatively, going north from the shower might lead to another area. But the user needs to reach the laundromat's floor.

The shadfly is on the floor of the laundromat, so the user must navigate to there. The previous steps have not led them there yet. The next action should be to go east from the shower, as that's the exit mentioned. Let's check the previous steps: the user went north, east, west, north, east, south, then west again.

The previous interactions show that the player has been moving between different rooms like the shower, cookery, and kitchenette. The main challenge seems to be navigating the environment and finding the shadfly.

Looking at the history, the player has been moving east and west, sometimes getting stuck in loops between the shower and kitchenette. The game's feedback mentions exits in certain directions, but the player keeps ending up in the same places. The key is to find the laundromat floor where the shadfly is located.

The user's last action was "go east," which led them back to the kitchenette. The next step should be to find a way to reach the laundromat. Since the initial instructions mentioned going north, east, west, and south in a specific order, maybe the player needs to follow that path again but more carefully. However, the current environment doesn't mention the laundromat yet, so perhaps the player needs to explore further.

The player might be in a loop between the shower and kitchenette. To break the loop, they need to try a different direction. The previous attempts to go north from the shower were unguarded, so maybe trying north again could lead to a new area. Alternatively, checking the fridge or other objects in the kitchenette might be necessary, but the fridge is empty. The chair and rack are also empty, so maybe the shadfly is in one of these places. However, the goal is to recover it from the laundromat floor, so the player needs to reach that location.

The next logical step is to go north from the shower, as that's the unguarded entrance mentioned. That should lead them out of the loop and towards the laundromat. So the command should be "go north."

Okay, let's try to figure out what's going on here. The user is in a text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and eventually recover the shadfly from the laundromat. The previous actions involved moving between rooms like shower, cookery, kitchenette, and back to shower, with some attempts to go north which were blocked.

Looking at the current situation: the user is in the Kitchenette, tried to go north but can't. The available exits mentioned are east and west. The goal is to recover the shadfly from the laundromat's floor. So far, the user hasn't found the shadfly yet.

The user's past actions include going north, east, west, south, etc., but they keep looping between rooms. The challenge is to avoid the loop and find the shadfly. Since the shadfly is in the laundromat, maybe the user needs to find the laundromat room. But the current room is Kitchenette, which is connected to Shower, Cookery, and possibly other areas.

Wait, the initial instructions mentioned going north, east, west, etc., but the game seems to loop between rooms. The key might be to find the laundromat floor where the shadfly is. Maybe the user needs to look for clues in the current room. The Kitchenette has a locked freezer, an empty fridge, a chair, and a rack. None of these seem to have the shadfly. But the user needs to find it.

Alternatively, maybe the shadfly is in the laundromat, which is a different room. The user needs to navigate to the laundromat. But how? The previous attempts to go north were blocked. Maybe the correct path is to go east from the Kitchenette, which is unblocked. The user tried going east before and ended up back in the Kitchenette. Wait, the exit to the east is unblocked, so maybe going east from Kitchenette leads to another room. But in the last interaction, after going east, it's back to Kitchenette. That suggests a loop.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west from Kitchenette. The exit to the west is mentioned as unblocked. So perhaps going west from Kitchenette leads to the Shower room again. But the user is stuck in a loop between Kitchenette, Shower, and Cookery.

The goal is to recover the shadfly from the laundromat. So the user needs to reach the laundromat. But the current rooms don't mention laundromat. Maybe the laundromat is the Shower room? Or another room. The initial description mentioned a laundromat, but the user hasn't found it yet.

Alternatively, maybe the shadfly is in the Kitchenette, but the user hasn't checked properly. The user needs to look for the shadfly in the current room. The Kitchenette has a locked freezer, empty fridge, chair, and rack. Maybe the shadfly is in the freezer, but it's locked. The user might need a key, but there's no mention of a key in the current room.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to find the laundromat by going through the exit to the east, which is unblocked. But when the user tried going east from Kitchenette, it looped back. Maybe the correct path is to go east from the Shower room, which is mentioned as having an exit to the east. Wait, in the Shower room, the exit to the east is unguarded. So maybe the user should go east from the Shower room to reach the laundromat.

But the user is currently in the Kitchenette. The previous steps were: Shower -> Cookery -> Kitchenette -> Shower -> Kitchenette. So the user is stuck in a loop between these rooms. The key is to find the laundromat. Maybe the laundromat is the Cookery room? Or another room. The initial instructions said to recover the shadfly from the floor of the laundromat. So the user needs to find the laundromat.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to look for the shadfly in the current room. The Kitchenette has a rack, which might be where the shadfly is. But the rack is described as empty. So that's not it.

Wait, the user's goal is to recover the shadfly from the laundromat's floor. So the user needs to reach the laundromat. The laundromat is probably a different room. The user hasn't found it yet. The previous rooms are Shower, Cookery, Kitchenette. Maybe the laundromat is the Cookery room? Or another room.

Alternatively, the user might need to find the laundromat by going through the exit to the east from the Kitchenette. But when the user tried that, it looped back. Maybe the correct path is to go west from the Kitchenette to the Shower, then east to the laundromat.

But the user is stuck in a loop. The next step is to try a different action. Since going north is blocked, maybe the user should try going west again, but that's what they did before. Alternatively, check the items in the current room for the shadfly. But the fridge is empty, the rack is empty. Maybe the shadfly is in the locked freezer. The user needs to open it. But there's no key mentioned. So maybe that's not the way.

Alternatively, the user needs to find the laundromat by going through the exit to the east from the Kitchenette, which is unblocked. But when they tried that, they ended up back in the Kitchenette. Maybe the exit to the east leads to another room that's not mentioned yet. Or perhaps the user needs to go west from the Kitchenette to the Shower, then east to the laundromat.

But the user is in the Kitchenette, and the exit to the east is unblocked. Maybe the correct action is to go east again, even though it loops, but maybe that's the way to the laundromat. Alternatively, the user needs to find a different path.

The key is to break the loop. Since the user is stuck between Kitchenette, Shower, and Cookery, maybe the next step is to go east from the Kitchenette, even if it loops, to reach the laundromat. Alternatively, check the items in the current room again. But the user hasn't found the shadfly yet. Maybe the shadfly is in the laundromat, which is the Cookery room. But the Cookery room has a refrigerator that's empty.

Alternatively, the user needs to find the laundromat by going through the exit to the east from the Shower room. The Shower room has an exit to the east. So maybe the user should go east from the Shower room to reach the laundromat.

But the user is currently in the Kitchenette. The previous steps were: go east from Kitchenette to Shower, then go east from Shower to Cookery, then go west to Kitchenette, etc. So the user is stuck in a loop. The next step is to try a different action. Since going north is blocked, maybe the user should try going west again, but that's what they did before. Alternatively, check the items in the current room again for the shadfly. But the items are empty. Maybe the shadfly is in the laundromat, which is a different room. The user needs to find it.

The answer is to go east from the Kitchenette, even though it loops, to reach the laundromat. But the user needs to find the correct path. Alternatively, the user needs to go west from the Kitchenette to the Shower, then east to the laundromat.

But the user is in the Kitchenette. The exit to the east is unblocked. So the next action is to go east again, even though it loops, to reach the laundromat.

GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Laundromat =-
You arrive in a laundromat. A standard one. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."



There is an unblocked exit to the north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

There is a shadfly on the floor.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game called TextWorld, and their goal is to recover the shadfly from the floor of the laundromat. From the previous interactions, it seems like the player has been moving around different rooms, like the shower, cookery, kitchenette, and now the laundromat.

Looking at the current scene, the user is in the laundromat, and there's a shadfly on the floor. The goal is to recover it. The previous actions involved moving east and west, but now they're in the laundromat. The next step would be to pick up the shadfly. However, the game might require specific commands like "take shadfly" or "get shadfly". Since the shadfly is on the floor, the player needs to interact with it directly. The correct command here would be to take the shadfly. Let me check if there are any other steps needed, but based on the goal, recovering the shadfly is the final step. So the next action should be to take the shadfly.
