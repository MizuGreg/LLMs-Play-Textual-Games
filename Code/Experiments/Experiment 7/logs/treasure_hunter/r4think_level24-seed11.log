It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! First thing I need you to do is to make an effort to move south. Then, ensure that the hatch within the shower is open. After that, make an attempt to take a trip east. Then, go east. That done, go to the south. With that over with, attempt to move east. Then, make an effort to venture east. And then, make an attempt to go to the north. And then, lift the Comic Strip Calendar from the floor of the workshop. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Basement =-
You arrive in a basement. A standard kind of place.

You make out a locked chest.

There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

There is a licorice strip on the floor.

You're now in the shower.

You make out a counter. The counter is usual. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.
