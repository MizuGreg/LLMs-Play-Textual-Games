THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in a text-based game. The goal is to move north, then north again, then east, south, pick up the passkey, and win. But they seem to be stuck in a loop between the Shower and Laundromat rooms.

First, I need to recap the game's objective. The user has to move north, then north again, then east, south, pick up the passkey, and win. So far, the user has gone north from Studio to Laundromat, then north again to Shower, then south back to Laundromat, then north again to Shower. They're stuck here, repeating the same steps.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Shower room again. The previous actions didn't help because they kept looping. The next step should be to try a different direction instead of just going north or south. The user needs to find the passkey, which is in the cellar, but they might not have explored that properly.

Wait, the user was in the Cellar earlier. They went west from the Cellar back to the Shower. Maybe they need to check the Cellar again for the passkey. But the passkey is in the chamber, which is the Studio? Or maybe the Cellar has the passkey. The initial instruction says to pick up the passkey from the floor of the chamber. The chamber is the Studio, but the user is in the Shower now. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the passkey is in the Cellar. The user needs to go west from the Cellar to the Shower, but then they can't get back. Wait, the Cellar has an exit to the south. So maybe the user should go south from the Cellar to the Laundromat, then north to the Shower again, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe the passkey is in the Laundromat. The user needs to check the Laundromat for the passkey. But the Laundromat has a towel on the floor. Wait, the initial instruction says to pick up the passkey from the floor of the chamber. The chamber is the Studio, but the user is in the Shower now. Maybe the passkey is in the Cellar. The user needs to go west from the Cellar to the Shower, but that's where they are now. Maybe they need to check the Cellar again for the passkey. But the Cellar's description doesn't mention a passkey. The Shower room has the passkey? Or maybe the user needs to go east from the Shower to the Cellar again. Wait, the user is in the Shower, and the directions say to try east or south. If they go east, they might reach the Cellar again. But the user was in the Cellar before and went west back to the Shower. So maybe the passkey is in the Cellar. The user needs to check there. But how? The user hasn't picked it up yet. So the next step is to go east from the Shower to the Cellar again, then check for the passkey. But the user is stuck in a loop between Shower and Laundromat. So the key is to break the loop by trying a different direction. The user should try going east from the Shower to the Cellar, then check for the passkey there. But the previous action was going south from the Shower to Laundromat. So the next action should be to go east instead of south. That would take them to the Cellar again. Then, maybe they can find the passkey there. So the next command should be "go east".

Okay, let's break this down. The user is stuck in a loop between the Shower and Cellar rooms. The goal is to move north, then north again, east, south, pick up the passkey, and win. But they've been going back and forth between Shower and Cellar.

First, the goal steps are: go north (Studio to Laundromat), then north again (Laundromat to Shower), then east (Shower to Cellar), south (Cellar to Laundromat), pick up passkey, win. But the user is stuck in the Shower/Cellar loop.

Past actions: They went north, then north again, then south, north, east, west, east, west, etc. So they've done the initial steps but got stuck. The next step should be to pick up the passkey. But where is it? The initial instruction says the passkey is in the chamber (Studio), but the user is in the Cellar now. Wait, maybe the passkey is in the Cellar. The user hasn't checked there yet. So instead of looping, they need to check the Cellar for the passkey. But the Cellar's description doesn't mention it. Hmm.

Wait, the user is in the Cellar, and the exit is south. Maybe the passkey is in the Cellar. The user needs to look around. But the game's feedback doesn't mention it. Alternatively, maybe the passkey is in the Laundromat. The user hasn't checked there. But the Laundromat has a towel. Maybe the passkey is in the Studio. But the user is in the Cellar. So the user needs to find a way back to the Studio. The path is Studio -> Laundromat -> Shower -> Cellar -> Laundromat -> Studio? Wait, the exit from the Cellar is south to Laundromat. Then from Laundromat, exit north to Studio. So the user needs to go south from Cellar to Laundromat, then north to Studio to pick up the passkey. But the user is in the Cellar, so going south to Laundromat, then north to Studio. But the user is stuck in the loop. So the next action should be to go south from Cellar to Laundromat, then north to Studio. But the user is in the Cellar, so the next command is "go south" to leave the Cellar and go back to Laundromat. Then from Laundromat, go north to Studio to pick up the passkey. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the current step is to go south from Cellar to Laundromat. Then from Laundromat, go north to Studio. Then pick up the passkey. So the next command is "go south".
