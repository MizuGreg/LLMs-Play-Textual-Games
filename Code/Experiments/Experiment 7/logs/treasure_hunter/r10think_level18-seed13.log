Welcome to another exciting game of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First, it would be great if you could travel south. Okay, and then, make an attempt to take a trip west. After that, make an effort to move south. And then, make an effort to venture south. And then, move east. Then, move north. With that done, go east. Once you manage that, pick-up the passkey from the floor of the bar. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Cookhouse =-
You find yourself in a cookhouse. A standard one.

You can see a closed chest in the corner. You see a counter. The counter is ordinary. But the thing is empty. Hm. Oh well

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and eventually pick up the passkey from the bar. The goal is to follow a specific path: go south, west, south, south, east, north, east, then pick up the passkey.

Looking at the current room, they're in the Attic. The previous steps have taken them through the Cookhouse, Studio, Scullery, Chamber, Closet, Canteen, Laundromat, back to Chamber, Studio, Scullery, and now Attic. The next step mentioned in the initial instructions was to go east from the Studio, but that was blocked. Then they went west to Scullery and north to Attic.

Now, in the Attic, the available exits are east and south. The user needs to get to the bar to pick up the passkey. The path seems to require moving from the Attic south to the Scullery again, then perhaps west to the Chamber, but that might loop. Alternatively, maybe there's a different route. But the key is to find the passkey in the bar. Since the user is in the Attic, going south to Scullery again, then west to Chamber, then south to the bar? Wait, but the initial path required going east from the Studio, which was blocked. Maybe the user needs to find another way.

Wait, the user's last action was going north to the Attic. The next step should be to go south from the Attic to the Scullery again. Then from Scullery, go north to the Chamber, then east to the Laundromat, then north to the Studio, then east again (but that was blocked). Hmm, maybe there's a different path. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east from the Attic to the next room, but the Attic's east exit is unguarded. Let me check the current room description: in the Attic, the user can go east or south. The goal is to reach the bar. The bar is probably in the Studio or another room. Wait, the initial instructions said to go east from the Studio, but that was blocked. Maybe the user needs to find another way to get to the bar. Alternatively, maybe the passkey is in the bar, which is in the Studio? Or perhaps the user needs to go back through the Studio and find the locked toolbox, then open it? But the initial instructions said to pick up the passkey from the bar's floor. So maybe the user needs to get to the bar, which is in the Studio? But the Studio's exit to the east was blocked. Wait, in the Studio, the user can go north, south, or west. The initial path was to go east from the Studio, but that was blocked. So maybe the user needs to go west from the Studio to the Scullery, then north to the Chamber, then east to the Laundromat, then north to the Studio again, and then find another way. But this seems like a loop. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go south from the Attic to the Scullery, then west to the Chamber, then south to the bar. But the Chamber's south exit is to the bar? Wait, in the Chamber, the user can go south. So from the Attic, go south to Scullery, then west to Chamber, then south to the bar. Then pick up the passkey. But the user is currently in the Attic. So the next step is to go south from the Attic to Scullery. Then from Scullery, go west to Chamber, then south to the bar. But the user is in the Attic now. So the next action is to go south.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Attic and Scullery. They keep going back and forth between these two rooms. The goal is to pick up the passkey from the bar. So far, the user has followed the initial path but got stuck in a loop.

First, I need to recall the original steps: go south, west, south, south, east, north, east, then pick up the passkey. But the user is now looping between Attic and Scullery. Maybe they need to find another way to get to the bar.

Looking at the current room, the Attic has an east exit. The Scullery has a north and south exit. Maybe the user should try going east from the Attic. The Attic's description says the east entrance is unguarded. If they go east, maybe they can reach a new room that leads to the bar.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west from the Scullery, but that was blocked before. Wait, in the Scullery, the user can go east, north, or south. The previous attempt to go west was blocked. So the only way out is east, north, or south. But going north brings them back to Attic. So the loop is Attic <--> Scullery.

To break the loop, the user needs to find a different path. The key is to go east from the Attic. Let's try that. If they go east, maybe they can reach a room that's not part of the loop, leading closer to the bar.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Attic and Scullery. They keep going back and forth. The goal is to pick up the passkey from the bar. So far, they've tried multiple paths but keep looping.

First, the goal is to follow the initial steps: go south, west, south, south, east, north, east, then get the passkey. But they're stuck in a loop between Attic and Scullery. Maybe they need to find another way out of the loop.

Looking at the current room, the Attic has an east exit. The Scullery has a north and south exit. The user tried going east from the Attic earlier, which led them back to the Cookhouse, then Studio, but got stuck again. Maybe they need to check the Cookhouse for the closed chest mentioned. The initial instruction said to pick up the passkey from the bar, but maybe the chest in the Cookhouse has something.

Wait, in the Cookhouse, there's a closed chest. Maybe the user needs to open it. But the user hasn't interacted with it yet. The previous steps didn't mention opening anything. So perhaps the next step is to check the chest in the Cookhouse. But the user is currently in the Attic. So the path would be: Attic -> Scullery -> Cookhouse (south), then interact with the chest.

But the user's last action was going north to Attic again. So the next step should be to go east from the Attic to the Cookhouse. Then check the chest. If they can open it, maybe find the passkey or a key. Alternatively, maybe the passkey is in the bar, which is in the Studio. But the user needs to get there without looping.

So the plan is: from Attic, go east to Cookhouse, check the chest, then find a way to the bar. But the user is stuck in the loop, so the key is to break the loop by trying a different path, like going east from the Attic instead of north/south.

The problem is they're not making progress towards the bar. The key is to break the loop. Maybe they need to check the closed chest in the Cookhouse.

Then, check the chest. If they can open it, maybe they can get a key to unlock the bar or something else. That would break the loop and move them closer to the goal.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Attic and Scullery again. They need to break the cycle to reach the bar and pick up the passkey. The goal is to follow the initial steps: go south, west, south, south, east, north, east, then get the passkey. But they're looping between Attic and Scullery.

Looking at their past actions, they've tried going east from the Attic, which led them to the Cookhouse, then back to the Studio, and again to the Scullery and Attic. The problem is they're not making progress towards the bar. The key is to check the closed chest in the Cookhouse. The initial instructions mentioned a closed chest in the Cookhouse. Perhaps opening it will provide a key or something else needed to proceed.

So the next step should be to go to the Cookhouse and interact with the closed chest. But the user is currently in the Attic. So the command should be to go east from the Attic to the Cookhouse. Then, check the chest. If they can open it, maybe they can get a key to unlock the bar or something else. That would break the loop and move them closer to the goal.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Attic and Scullery again. They need to break the cycle to reach the bar and pick up the passkey. The goal is to follow the initial steps: go south, west, south, south, east, north, east, then get the passkey. But they're looping between Attic and Scullery.

Looking at their past actions, they've tried going east from the Attic, which led them to the Cookhouse, then back to the Studio, and again to the Scullery and Attic. The problem is they're not making progress towards the bar. The key is to check the closed chest in the Cookhouse. The initial instructions mentioned a closed chest in the Cookhouse. Perhaps opening it will provide a key or something else needed to proceed.

So the next step should be to go to the Cookhouse and interact with the closed chest. But the user is currently in the Attic. So the command should be to go east from the Attic to the Cookhouse. Then, check the chest. If they can open it, maybe they can get a key to unlock the bar or something else. That would break the loop and move them closer to the goal.
