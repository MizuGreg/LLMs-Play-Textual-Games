Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to head south. Following that, make an effort to go to the east. Once you accomplish that, try to head north. Following that, venture east. Then, go east. And then, go north. Then, make an attempt to go to the east. If you can do that, take a trip south. Following that, make an attempt to head south. And then, take a trip west. And then, move west. After that, take the keycard from the saucepan. That's it!

-= Lounge =-
You arrive in a lounge. An ordinary one.

You can make out a shelf. The shelf is standard. But the thing is empty. Hm. Oh well Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a mantle. The mantle is usual. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to follow a specific sequence of movements and retrieve the keycard from the saucepan. So far, they've gone south from the lounge to the kitchen. The next steps in the original instruction were to go east, then north, east, east, north, east, south, south, west, west, and then take the keycard.

In the kitchen, the available exits are east and north. The user needs to go east first. But the previous response was to go south, which might have been a mistake. Wait, no—the initial instructions said to go south first, then east, then north, etc. But in the kitchen, the user is already south of the lounge. So maybe the next step after going south to the kitchen is to go east as per the original plan.

But the user's current location is the kitchen. The next step in the original plan was to go east from the kitchen. However, the user's last action was going south, which might have been part of the initial steps. Wait, the user's first action was "go south" from the lounge, which took them to the kitchen. Then, according to the original plan, after going south, they should go east. So the next step should be to go east from the kitchen. But the current prompt says that in the kitchen, the user can go east or north. So the next action should be "go east".

But the user might be in a loop if they keep going back and forth. However, the original plan specifies a sequence that might not loop. Let me check the steps again. The original plan is: south, east, north, east, east, north, east, south, south, west, west, then take the keycard. So after the first south to the kitchen, the next is east. So the next action should be "go east".

Okay, let's see. The user wants me to navigate through the TextWorld game according to their instructions. The goal is to follow a specific sequence of directions and eventually take the keycard from the saucepan.

First, I need to recap the goal step by step. The user said: go south, then east, north, east, east, north, east, south, south, west, west, then take the keycard from the saucepan. So each step is a direction, and after moving around, there's the keycard to get.

Looking at the current state: the user is in the Cookery. The previous actions were go south (from Lounge to Kitchen), then go east (from Kitchen to Cookery). Now, the next step according to the original plan was to go north from Cookery. But the prompt says "You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. There is an unblocked exit to the north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west." So the exits here are east and north. But the user's next step in the plan was to go north. However, maybe there's a loop here. Let me check the previous steps again.

Wait, the original plan after Cookery was to go north, then east, east, north, etc. But in the current Cookery room, the available exits are east and north. So if I go north from Cookery, that's the next step. But maybe the user is stuck in a loop because the directions are repeating. Alternatively, maybe the keycard is in a different location. But according to the user's instruction, after moving around, the keycard is in the saucepan. So perhaps the keycard is in a room that's accessible after moving through the directions.

But the current step is in Cookery. The next step according to the original plan was to go north. However, the user's instruction says after going north from Cookery, then go east, east, north, etc. So maybe the next action is to go north. But the prompt says "You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. There is an unblocked exit to the north." So maybe the user can go north. But the user's previous action was go east, so maybe the next step is north. But the user's plan says after Cookery, go north, then east, east, north, etc. So the next action should be north. However, the user might be in a loop if moving north and east repeatedly. But according to the instructions, the user needs to follow the sequence. So the next step is to go north from Cookery. But the user's previous action was go east, so maybe the next step is north. But the system message says to not repeat the same action if it's not being recognized. Wait, the user's previous action was go east, and now the available exits are east and north. So going north is the next step. So the next command should be go north. But the user's plan says after Cookery, go north. So that's the next step. But maybe the user is in a loop, so perhaps using a synonym like go north. But the system says to not repeat the same action if it's not being recognized. However, in this case, the user is following the plan, so go north is correct. So the next action is go north.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in TextWorld according to the given instructions. The goal is to eventually take the keycard from the saucepan. Let me break down the steps they've taken so far.

First, they started in the Lounge, went south to the Kitchen, then east to the Cookery, then north to the Dish-Pit. Now, in the Dish-Pit, the available exits are east, north, south, and west. The previous actions were moving in different directions, but maybe they're stuck in a loop. The user's instructions mention moving east, north, east, north, east, south, south, west, west, and then taking the keycard from the saucepan. 

Wait, the current room is Dish-Pit. The user needs to follow the sequence: after the Dish-Pit, the next steps should be going east, then south, then south, then west, then west. But in the Dish-Pit, the exits are south and west unguarded. So maybe the next step is to go south. But the user's previous action was going north. Let me check the steps again.

The original plan was: south, east, north, east, east, north, east, south, south, west, west. But in the current position (Dish-Pit), they need to go south. However, the user might be repeating actions. The key is to find the saucepan and take the keycard. But the user hasn't found it yet. Maybe the saucepan is in a different room. Alternatively, maybe the keycard is in the Dish-Pit. But the user hasn't checked there yet. Wait, the initial instruction says to take the keycard from the saucepan. So perhaps the saucepan is in a room where the user can access it after moving through the required exits.

But according to the current room (Dish-Pit), the exits are south and west. The user needs to go south first. Then, from there, maybe they can proceed. But the user's previous steps might have led them in a loop. So the next action should be to go south. However, the user might have already done that. Wait, the user is in the Dish-Pit, and the previous steps were moving north. So the next step is to go south. But the user's instruction says after Dish-Pit, go south, then south again, then west, then west. So from Dish-Pit, go south. Then, from the next room, go south again. Then west twice. But the user needs to check if the saucepan is in one of these rooms. Alternatively, maybe the keycard is in the Dish-Pit. But the user hasn't checked there yet. However, the initial instruction says to take the keycard from the saucepan, which might be in a different room. 

But according to the current position, the user needs to proceed with the steps: from Dish-Pit, go south. Then, from there, go south again, then west, then west. So the next action is to go south.

The next step in the original plan was to go east from the Dish-Pit, but since they're back in Cookery, maybe they need to try a different direction. The available exits here are east, north, and west. The user has already tried going west before, so maybe trying north or east again. However, the instruction says to avoid repeating actions if they're not making progress. Since the user is in a loop, they need to find a different path. The next step might be to go north from the Cookery to break the loop and proceed further.

Okay, let's try to figure out what's going on here. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in a text-based game, following a specific sequence of directions. The goal is to eventually take the keycard from the saucepan. Let me break down the steps they've taken so far.

Starting from the Lounge, they went south to the Kitchen, then east to the Cookery, north to the Dish-Pit, south back to Cookery, and then north again to Dish-Pit. It seems like they're moving between these rooms repeatedly without making progress towards the keycard. 

The problem is that the user is stuck in a loop between the Cookery and Dish-Pit. The instructions mention that after certain movements, they need to find the keycard in the saucepan. But so far, they haven't found any objects except maybe the saucepan. Wait, the original instruction said to take the keycard from the saucepan, so maybe the saucepan is in one of these rooms.

Looking at the current room, Dish-Pit, the exits are east, north, south, and west. The user has been moving between north and south, which might not be the right approach. Maybe they need to explore east or west instead. The keycard is supposed to be in the saucepan, so perhaps the saucepan is in the Cookery room. But the user hasn't checked the Cookery room's contents yet. 

In the Cookery room, the description mentions an unblocked exit to the north and west. Maybe the saucepan is there. But the user hasn't looked inside the rooms properly. They need to check the objects in each room. However, the game's responses don't mention any objects except the exits. Wait, the initial Lounge had a shelf and a mantle, but they were empty. The Kitchen had a freezer. The Cookery and Dish-Pit don't mention any objects. 

Wait, the original instruction said to take the keycard from the saucepan. So the saucepan must be in one of these rooms. Maybe in the Cookery room. But the user hasn't checked there yet. So perhaps the next step is to check the Cookery room for the saucepan. But how? The user needs to look around. However, the game's responses only mention exits. Maybe the saucepan is in the Cookery room, and the user needs to look inside. But the game's current responses don't indicate that. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to move east from the Dish-Pit to find the saucepan. The Dish-Pit has an unguarded exit to the east. So going east from Dish-Pit would take them to another room. Let's check the previous steps. The user was in Dish-Pit, then went south to Cookery, then north back to Dish-Pit. So maybe the next step is to go east from Dish-Pit. That would be a new room. Let's assume that's where the saucepan is. So the correct action would be to go east from Dish-Pit. That's the next step to break the loop and find the saucepan.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to follow a specific sequence of movements and eventually take the keycard from the saucepan. So far, the assistant has moved south, east, north, east, north, east, and then to the vault. Now, in the vault, the exits are east, south, and west.

The next step according to the original instructions was to take the keycard from the saucepan. But the user hasn't mentioned a saucepan yet. Wait, the initial instruction said to "take the keycard from the saucepan." So maybe the keycard is in the saucepan, which is in the vault?

Looking at the current location, the vault has exits east, south, and west. The user needs to find the saucepan and take the keycard. But the current description doesn't mention a saucepan. Hmm, maybe the saucepan is in one of the rooms, and the assistant needs to navigate to it.

Wait, the previous steps were moving around the kitchen, cookery, dish-pit, and now the vault. The original plan was to go south, east, north, east, north, east, then south, west, west, and then take the keycard from the saucepan. But in the vault, the exits are east, south, west. So maybe the saucepan is in the vault, and the assistant needs to check there.

But the current description of the vault doesn't mention a saucepan. Maybe the assistant needs to look around. However, the game's responses only mention exits. So perhaps the keycard is in the vault, and the assistant needs to take it from the saucepan, which is in the vault. But the description doesn't explicitly state that. Alternatively, maybe the saucepan is in a different room, and the assistant needs to find it.

Wait, the initial instruction said to "take the keycard from the saucepan." So the keycard is in the saucepan, which is in the vault. But the current room is the vault, and the exits are east, south, west. The assistant needs to check if the saucepan is here. Since the description doesn't mention it, maybe the assistant needs to look for it. But the game's responses don't allow for searching, only moving.

Alternatively, maybe the assistant needs to go west from the vault. The previous action was going east to the vault. Now, the exits are east, south, west. So maybe the saucepan is in the west direction. Let's check the previous steps. The user's path was: lounge -> kitchen -> cookery -> dish-pit -> vault. The next step would be to go west from the vault. But the original plan was to go west twice. Wait, the original instructions said after moving west twice, take the keycard from the saucepan. So maybe in the vault, going west would lead to a room with the saucepan.

But the current room is the vault. The exits are east, south, west. So the assistant should go west. But the user's last action was going east to the vault. Now, the next step is to go west. But the original plan was to go west twice. So maybe after going west from the vault, the assistant would find the saucepan and take the keycard.

So the next action should be to go west. But the user's previous action was going east to the vault. Now, the next step is to go west. However, the assistant's previous steps might have already done that. Wait, the user's path is: starting at lounge, then south to kitchen, east to cookery, north to dish-pit, east to vault. Now, in the vault, the exits are east, south, west. So the next step is to go west. But the original plan was to go west twice. So maybe after going west once, the assistant would be in a room where the saucepan is. Then, take the keycard.

But the current description of the vault doesn't mention a saucepan. So perhaps the assistant needs to check the rooms again. But the game's responses only mention exits. Therefore, the assistant should proceed to go west from the vault to find the saucepan and take the keycard.

Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is in a text-based game where they need to follow a specific sequence of movements to reach the keycard in the saucepan. The goal is to navigate through different rooms by moving in certain directions: south, east, north, east, east, north, east, south, south, west, west, and then take the keycard from the saucepan.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Dish-Pit again, which they've been stuck in for a while. The previous actions led them back to the Dish-Pit, so there's a loop here. The directions available are east, north, south, and west. The user has already tried going east, north, south, and west multiple times without making progress.

The key is to break the loop. Since the user is in the Dish-Pit, maybe they need to find a different path. The Vault was previously mentioned as a place with exits to east, south, and west. But they went back to the Dish-Pit. Maybe they need to go west from the Vault to escape the loop. Alternatively, perhaps they need to go north from the Dish-Pit, but that's already been tried.

Wait, the user's goal is to take the keycard from the saucepan. The saucepan is probably in the kitchen or another room. The previous steps mentioned the kitchen, cookery, dish-pit, and vault. Maybe the keycard is in the vault, and the user needs to get there. But they keep getting stuck in the dish-pit.

The last action was going west from the Vault, which brought them back to the Dish-Pit. So, the loop is between the Vault and the Dish-Pit. To break this, the user needs to find a different path. Maybe instead of going west from the Vault, they should go south or east. But the Vault has an unblocked exit to the south and east. Let me check the previous steps.

In the Vault, the exits are east, south, and west. The user went west, which led back to the Dish-Pit. If they go south from the Vault, that's an unblocked exit. Maybe that's the way to go. Alternatively, going east from the Vault might lead to another room. But the user needs to reach the saucepan with the keycard. The keycard is in the saucepan, which is probably in the kitchen or another area.

Wait, the initial instructions said to take the keycard from the saucepan. The user hasn't done that yet. So, maybe after navigating through the rooms, they need to find the saucepan. But the current location is the Dish-Pit, which doesn't mention a saucepan. The kitchen had an opened freezer, but no saucepan. The cookery might have it. Alternatively, the vault might have the saucepan.

But the user is stuck in a loop between the Dish-Pit and Vault. The solution is to find a way out of the loop. The previous action was going west from the Vault, which led back. So, instead of west, maybe go south from the Vault. Let's try that. The Vault has an unblocked exit to the south. Going south from the Vault would take the user to the Dish-Pit again, but maybe that's part of the path. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east from the Vault to reach another room.

But the user's goal is to take the keycard from the saucepan. The keycard is in the saucepan, so the user needs to find the saucepan. The initial instructions mention the saucepan, but the user hasn't found it yet. The user is in the Dish-Pit, which is a usual room. The cookery and vault are other rooms. The keycard might be in the vault or another room.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east from the Vault to reach the cookery again. But the cookery was previously visited. The user needs to find the saucepan. Since the user is in the Dish-Pit, maybe the saucepan is there. But the Dish-Pit description doesn't mention a saucepan. The kitchen had an opened freezer, but no saucepan. The cookery might have it. The user needs to navigate through the rooms to find the saucepan.

But the user is stuck in a loop. The solution is to break the loop by choosing a different direction. The previous actions were going west, which led back. So, instead of west, go south from the Vault. That would take the user to the Dish-Pit again, but maybe that's necessary. Alternatively, go east from the Vault to reach another room.

But the user's next action should be to go south from the Vault. That's the unblocked exit. So the next command is "go south".

-= Cookery =-
You've entered a cookery.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. There is an unblocked exit to the north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in a text-based game. The goal is to follow a specific sequence of directions: south, east, north, east, east, north, east, south, south, west, west, and then take the keycard from the saucepan.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Cookery room again. The previous steps have led them back and forth between the Dish-Pit and Cookery. The challenge is to avoid loops and proceed towards the saucepan where the keycard is located.

The user has already gone through several directions, but they're stuck in a loop between Cookery and Dish-Pit. The next step should be to find a way to proceed towards the vault or another area where the saucepan might be. The Vault room had an unblocked exit to the west, which might lead to the correct path.

Since the user is in Cookery, the options are east, north, or west. The previous actions suggest that going west might be the way to break the loop. However, the user has already tried going west and ended up back in Dish-Pit. Maybe trying a different direction, like north, could lead to a new area. But the instruction says to go north again, which might not be helpful.

Wait, the goal is to take the keycard from the saucepan. The saucepan is probably in the Vault or another room. The user needs to reach the Vault, find the saucepan, and take the keycard. So the next step is to go west from the Vault to reach the saucepan. But the user is currently in Cookery. The correct path would be to go east from Cookery to reach the Vault, then west to get to the saucepan.

But in the current state, the user is in Cookery, and the options are east, north, or west. The previous steps have led to loops, so maybe the correct action is to go east again to reach the Vault. Then, from the Vault, go west to the saucepan. However, the user has already tried going west and ended up in Dish-Pit. So perhaps the correct next step is to go east from Cookery to the Vault, then west to get the keycard.

-= Scullery =-
You find yourself in a scullery. A normal one. The room is well lit.

You can see a chest. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a saucepan. The saucepan is usual. On the saucepan you can see a keycard.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

Okay, let's see. The user's goal is to follow a specific sequence of movements and eventually take the keycard from the saucepan. So far, they've been moving through different rooms: Lounge → Kitchen → Cookery → Dish-Pit → Vault → Dish-Pit again → Cookery again → Scullery. Now, in the Scullery, they see a chest and a saucepan with a keycard on it.

The next step according to the initial instructions was to take the keycard from the saucepan. The user hasn't done that yet. The current room (Scullery) has the saucepan, so the next action should be to pick up the keycard. The previous actions were moving around, but now the objective is to interact with the saucepan. The keycard is on the saucepan, so the correct command here is to take the keycard. The user needs to perform that action to complete the game.
