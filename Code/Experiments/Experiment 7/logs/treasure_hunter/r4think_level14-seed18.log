It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to attempt to go north. And then, make sure that the walnut gate is ajar. After that, take a trip west. Following that, make an effort to head south. If you can do that, retrieve the latchkey from the floor of the closet. Got that? Good!

-= Sauna =-
You arrive in a sauna. A typical kind of place.



There is an open passageway leading north. There is an open gateway leading south.

-= Bathroom =-
You've come into a typical room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be typical. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the bathroom.

You make out a cabinet. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a drawer. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a trunk.

There is a closed walnut gate leading west. There is an open passageway leading south.

You open walnut gate.

-= Office =-
You've just sauntered into an office.



There is an open walnut gate leading east. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text-based game where they need to follow specific steps to achieve the goal. The current location is the Office. The previous actions were: go north (from Sauna to Bathroom), open walnut gate, go west (to Office). Now, the next step according to the initial instructions was to go south from the Office.

But looking at the current scene in the Office, there's an open passageway leading south. So the next logical step is to go south. However, the user might be stuck in a loop if they keep moving between the same areas. Let me check the previous steps again.

The original task was: go north, open walnut gate, go west, go south, retrieve the latchkey from the closet floor. So after going west to the Office, the next step is to go south. But the user is in the Office now. The Office has an open passage south. So going south should lead to the next room. If that's the case, then the next action is to go south. But maybe the user is in a loop because they've already been there before. Wait, the initial steps were Sauna -> Bathroom -> Office. Going south from Office would take them back to the Bathroom? Or maybe to another room. Let me check the previous descriptions.

In the Bathroom, there was an open passageway south and a closed walnut gate west. Then, after opening the walnut gate and going west, they entered the Office. So going south from the Office would take them back to the Bathroom. But the user's next step is to go south. However, the original plan was to go south after going west. So maybe that's the correct step. But if the user is in a loop, perhaps they need to find another way. However, according to the current setup, the Office has a south passage. So the next action is to go south. Then, after that, they would be in the Bathroom again. But the next step after going south is to retrieve the latchkey from the closet. Wait, the original instructions said after going south, retrieve the latchkey from the closet floor. So maybe after going south, they need to check the closet. But in the Bathroom, there's a trunk and a cabinet. Maybe the closet is in the Bathroom. So after going south, they would be in the Bathroom again, then check the closet. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next step is to go south from the Office. Then, in the Bathroom, look for the closet. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action is go south.

-= Closet =-
You find yourself in a closet. An ordinary one. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You see a stand. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north.

There is a latchkey on the floor.
