You are now playing a life changing game of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. Your first objective is to attempt to move north. And then, make an effort to venture north. After that, make an effort to go to the east. After that, go to the south. Following that, pick-up the passkey from the floor of the chamber. And once you've done that, you win!

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let me try to figure out the best way to proceed here. The user is in a text-based game where they need to follow a specific sequence of movements and collect a passkey. Let me recap the current situation.

First, the user started in a studio, went north to a laundromat, then north again to a shower. Now they're in the shower. The goal is to move north, then east, then south, pick up the passkey, and win. 

Looking at the current location: the shower. The prompt says there's an unblocked exit to the south and suggests trying east or south. The user needs to go east next, as per the original plan. But the previous action was going north again, which might not be helpful. Wait, the original plan was after moving north (to laundromat), then north again (to shower), then east. But the shower's description says to try east or south. The user's next step should be east. However, the user might be stuck in a loop if they keep going north. But in the shower, the options are east or south. So the next step is to go east. Then after that, go south, then pick up the passkey. But in the shower, is there a passkey? The user needs to check the floor. Wait, in the laundromat, there was a towel on the floor. In the shower, maybe there's the passkey. But the user hasn't picked it up yet. So after going east, they might find the passkey. But the current step is to go east from the shower. So the next action should be go east. Let me check the previous steps again. The user has already gone north twice. The original plan was north, then east, then south. But in the shower, the user is supposed to go east. So the next action is go east. Then, after that, go south. Then pick up the passkey. But the user needs to make sure they're in the right location. So the next command is go east.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text adventure game where they need to follow specific movements and collect a passkey. The goal is to move north, then east, then south, pick up the passkey, and win.

Looking at the current state: The user is in the Shower again (as per the latest prompt). They've been moving between Shower, Laundromat, and Cellar, going back and forth. The previous actions were go east, then go west, which brought them back to the Shower. This suggests a loop between Shower and Cellar.

The user has already completed the initial steps: moved north (from Studio to Laundromat), then north again (to Shower). The next step in the original plan was to go east from the Shower. But after that, they went west to the Cellar, then back to Shower, creating a loop. Now, they need to break this loop and proceed towards the south to collect the passkey.

The passkey is mentioned to be on the floor of the chamber. The user is in the Shower now. The original plan was to go south after east, but they kept looping. So the next step should be to go south from the Shower to reach the Laundromat again, then find the passkey. However, in the Laundromat, there's a towel, not the passkey. Wait, maybe the passkey is in the Cellar? Or perhaps in the Shower itself. The user needs to check the floor of the current chamber (Shower) for the passkey. But the previous steps didn't mention it. Alternatively, maybe after going south from the Shower to Laundromat, they can check the floor there. But the Laundromat has a towel. Hmm.

Wait, the original instructions said to pick up the passkey from the floor of the chamber after moving south. So perhaps after going south from the Shower (which is step 3 in the original plan), they need to check the chamber (Laundromat) for the passkey. But in the Laundromat, there's a towel. Maybe the passkey is in the Cellar? Or maybe the user needs to go further north from the Laundromat. But the Laundromat's north exit is unguarded. Wait, the user's path has been looping between Shower and Cellar. To break the loop, they need to go south from the Shower to Laundromat, then proceed north again to exit, but that might not help. Alternatively, maybe the passkey is in the Shower itself. The user needs to check the floor here. But the previous steps didn't mention it. So the next action should be to go south from the Shower to Laundromat, then check the floor there for the passkey. But the user is in the Shower again, so the next step is to go south. However, the user just tried going east and then west, leading back to Shower. So the correct next step is to go south from the Shower to Laundromat, then check the floor for the passkey. But the Laundromat's description says there's a towel. Maybe the passkey is in the Cellar. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west from the Cellar to reach the Shower again. But this is getting confusing. The key is to break the loop by going south from the Shower to Laundromat, then proceed to pick up the passkey there. So the next action is go south.
