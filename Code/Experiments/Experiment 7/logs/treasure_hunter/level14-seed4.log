Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. Your first objective is to travel north. After that, try to travel east. And then, take a trip south. Okay, and then, attempt to move south. That done, pick-up the napkin from the floor of the scullery. That's it!

-= Parlor =-
You've entered a parlor.

You can see a bed stand. You wonder idly who left that here. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.
