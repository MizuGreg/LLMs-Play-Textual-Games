THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Spare Room and the Chamber. They've been going back and forth between south and north, which isn't making progress. The goal is to pick up the carrot from the bedchamber. So far, they've moved south, west, then back and forth. The problem is they're stuck in a cycle.

First, I need to check if the carrot is in the Chamber or the Spare Room. The description mentions the Chamber has an exit to the east and a north entrance. The Spare Room has an exit to the east and suggests going south. But the carrot is in the bedchamber. Wait, maybe the bedchamber is a different room. The user hasn't checked the east exit yet. 

In the Chamber, the exit to the east is unblocked. Maybe going east from the Chamber would lead to the bedchamber where the carrot is. The user has been going north and south repeatedly, but they need to try the east exit. So the next step is to go east from the Chamber. That should break the loop and lead to the bedchamber where the carrot is located.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to pick up the carrot from the bedchamber. So far, they've been moving between the Spare Room and the Chamber, going south and north repeatedly. That's a loop. The problem is they're not progressing towards the bedchamber.

Looking at the current room, the Chamber has an exit to the east. The user hasn't tried that yet. The previous actions were stuck in a cycle between south and north. The key is to break the loop by trying the east exit from the Chamber. That should lead them to the bedchamber where the carrot is. So the next action should be to go east.
</think>go east
