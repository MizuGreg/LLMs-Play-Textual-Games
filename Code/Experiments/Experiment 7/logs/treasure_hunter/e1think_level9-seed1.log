Welcome to TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First, it would be a great idea if you could venture south. And then, go east. And then, travel north. With that over with, make an effort to go north. With that done, pick-up the passkey from the floor of the cookery. Got that? Good!

-= Spare Room =-
If you're wondering why everything seems so standard all of a sudden, it's because you've just shown up in the spare room.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

There is a keycard on the floor.

FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text-based game where they need to follow specific directions to find a passkey. The initial instructions say to go south, then east, then north, and finally pick up the passkey from the cookery.

First, the user started by going south, which took them to the Dish-Pit. Now, they need to follow the next steps: go east, then north. But in the current room (Dish-Pit), there's an exit to the east and north. The user's next move should be east. But wait, the user might be in a loop if they keep moving between rooms without progress. However, the goal is to reach the cookery and pick up the passkey. So, after going east from the Dish-Pit, they might reach another area where the passkey is located. Alternatively, maybe the cookery is in a room that requires moving north from the Dish-Pit. But the user needs to check the rooms they've visited. The Spare Room had a keycard, but the goal is the passkey in the cookery. So, the next step is to go east from the Dish-Pit, then proceed north to reach the cookery. The user needs to make sure they don't loop by repeating the same actions. Since the previous action was going south, the next should be east. Then, after that, north. But the user's last action was going south, so the next step is east. Then, after east, go north. Once in the cookery, pick up the passkey. So the next command is go east.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Cookhouse now. The goal was to venture south, then east, then north, pick up the passkey from the cookery.

Wait, the initial instructions said first go south, then east, then north. But in the Spare Room, they went south to the Dish-Pit, then east to the Cookhouse. Now in the Cookhouse, the next step was supposed to be north. But the user is here, so maybe they need to go north from the Cookhouse. But the current room is Cookhouse, and the directions mentioned are north and west. The passkey is in the cookery, which might be the cookhouse. So maybe the passkey is here. The user needs to pick it up. But the previous step was going north from the Dish-Pit to the Cookhouse. Now, in the Cookhouse, they need to check if the passkey is here. The user's last action was going east to the Cookhouse. Now, the next step is to go north from the Cookhouse. But the user is in the Cookhouse, so maybe they need to go north again? Wait, but the initial plan was to go south, then east, then north. But after going east to the Cookhouse, the next step was supposed to be north. But the user is in the Cookhouse now. So maybe they need to go north from here. But the Cookhouse's north exit is unblocked. So the next action should be go north. But the user is already in the Cookhouse. Wait, maybe the passkey is in the Cookhouse. The user needs to pick it up. So the next step is to check the floor for the passkey. But the initial instruction said to pick up the passkey from the floor of the cookery. So maybe in the Cookhouse, there's a passkey on the floor. So the user needs to pick it up. But the previous actions were moving around. So the next step is to pick up the passkey. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the correct action is to pick up the passkey. But the user's last action was going east to the Cookhouse. Now, in the Cookhouse, they need to pick up the passkey. So the next command should be 'take passkey' or 'pick up passkey'. But the game might require the exact wording. Alternatively, maybe the passkey is in the cookery, which is the Cookhouse. So the user needs to check the floor here. So the next action is to pick up the passkey. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the answer should be 'take passkey' or 'pick up passkey'. But the previous steps were moving, so the next step is to pick up the key. Therefore, the next action is to pick up the passkey.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through TextWorld. The goal is to pick up the passkey from the cookery. Let me recap the steps so far.

First, they started in the spare room, went south to the dish-pit, then east to the cookhouse. Now, they tried to pick up the passkey but couldn't see it. So, maybe the passkey is in a different location or they need to check another area.

Wait, the initial instructions said to go south, then east, then north, then pick up the passkey. But in the current room (cookhouse), there's no mention of the passkey. Maybe they need to check the north or west exits? The cookhouse has exits to north and west. The user tried picking up the passkey but couldn't. Maybe the passkey is in the north room? Or perhaps they need to look around more carefully.

Alternatively, maybe the passkey is in the dish-pit or spare room. But the user is in the cookhouse now. The previous steps were: spare room (south to dish-pit, east to cookhouse). The next step after cookhouse would be to go north or west. The original plan was to go north from the cookhouse. Wait, the initial task was to go south, then east, then north. So after arriving in the cookhouse, the next step was supposed to be north. But the user tried to pick up the passkey instead. That might be the issue. They need to go north first, then check the cookery area.

So the correct sequence is: spare room → dish-pit → cookhouse → north. Then, in the next room (maybe the cookery), pick up the passkey. So the user is in the cookhouse, needs to go north. The previous action of picking up the passkey was incorrect because it wasn't there. Therefore, the next action should be to go north.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing a text-based game where they need to follow specific steps to reach the goal. The initial instructions were to go south, then east, then north, and finally pick up the passkey from the cookery.

First, I need to break down the current state. The user has already moved through the Spare Room, Dish-Pit, and Cookhouse. They tried to pick up the passkey but couldn't see it. Then they went north to the Studio. Now, they're in the Studio, and the next step is probably to find the passkey.

Wait, the original goal was to pick up the passkey from the cookery. But in the Cookhouse, when they tried to pick it up, they couldn't see it. Maybe the passkey is in a different location now. The user is in the Studio, so maybe they need to check other directions or look for clues.

Looking at the current room description: the Studio has exits to north, south, and west. The user has already gone north to the Studio. The previous actions were going south, east, north, and then trying to pick up the key. Since they couldn't find it in the Cookhouse, maybe they need to check another direction from the Studio. Perhaps the passkey is in the south or west direction. Alternatively, maybe they need to go back to the Cookhouse again but in a different way.

But the user is in the Studio now. The next step would be to check the south or west exits. Since the user is in the Studio, going south would take them back to the Cookhouse. Maybe the passkey is there, but they need to look again. Alternatively, maybe the passkey is in the west direction. But the user hasn't checked that yet.

Wait, the original instruction said to pick up the passkey from the floor of the cookery. So maybe the key is in the Cookhouse. But when they tried to pick it up, they couldn't see it. Maybe they need to look more carefully or check the floor again. However, in the current room (Studio), they need to move back to the Cookhouse to find it.

So the next action should be to go south back to the Cookhouse. But the user is in the Studio, so going south would take them back to the Cookhouse. Then, they can check the floor again for the passkey. Alternatively, maybe the passkey is in another location now.

But according to the game's structure, the user needs to follow the steps: go south, east, north, then pick up the key. But they might have gotten stuck. So the next step is to go south from the Studio to the Cookhouse again, then check the floor for the key. However, the user's last action was going north to the Studio, so the next step would be to go south back to the Cookhouse. Then, maybe check the floor again. But the user might have to try a different action if they're in a loop. Since they tried going north before and ended up in the Studio, maybe they need to try a different direction from the Studio, like west, to find the key.

Alternatively, maybe the passkey is in the Studio itself. But the initial instruction said it's in the cookery. So probably, the user needs to go back to the Cookhouse. Therefore, the next action is to go south from the Studio to the Cookhouse again, then check the floor for the key.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Cookhouse again after moving south from the Studio. The previous attempt to pick up the passkey failed because the user couldn't see it. Now, the user needs to figure out the next step.

First, the goal is to pick up the passkey. The user has already been in the Cookhouse before, but maybe the passkey is now visible. However, the last attempt to pick it up didn't work. The user might need to check the room again or look for clues. But according to the game's structure, the passkey is on the floor of the cookery, which is the Cookhouse. So perhaps the user needs to look around more carefully.

But the game's response says the user can't see the passkey. So maybe the user needs to try a different action. The previous action was "pick up passkey," which didn't work. The user might need to try a different command, like looking around or checking the room again. However, the game's allowed commands are movement directions and picking up items.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west from the Cookhouse, as the description mentions an unguarded exit to the west. But the initial goal was to go north, east, then north again. Wait, the original task was to go south, then east, then north, then pick up the passkey. But the user is now in the Cookhouse again, so maybe they need to go west to find the passkey.

But the user's last action was "go south," leading back to the Cookhouse. The next step should be to check the west direction, as that's unguarded. However, the user's previous attempt to pick up the passkey failed. Maybe the passkey is now in view after moving west. Alternatively, the user might need to go north again from the Cookhouse.

Wait, the user's goal is to pick up the passkey. The initial instruction said to go to the cookery's floor. So maybe the user needs to check the floor again. But the game says the passkey is on the floor, but the user can't see it. Maybe the user needs to look around more carefully. However, the allowed commands are movement and picking up. So perhaps the user needs to try moving west to find the passkey.

Alternatively, the user might be in a loop between the Cookhouse and Studio. The previous steps were: Spare Room → Dish-Pit → Cookhouse → Studio → Cookhouse again. So the user is stuck in a loop. To break the loop, the user needs to try a different action. Instead of going north or south, maybe go west from the Cookhouse.

So the next action should be to go west from the Cookhouse. That's the unguarded exit mentioned. Then, perhaps the passkey is in that direction. Alternatively, the user might need to go north again from the Cookhouse. But the user has already tried that. The key is to avoid repeating the same action. Since the previous attempt to pick up the passkey failed, the user should try a different action, like going west.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and collect items. The goal mentioned initially was to venture south, then east, then north, and pick up the passkey from the cookhouse's floor.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Dish-Pit again. They've been moving between rooms: from the Spare Room to Dish-Pit, then to Cookhouse, Studio, back to Cookhouse, Dish-Pit again. The passkey was mentioned in the Cookhouse, but when they tried to pick it up, it wasn't there. Now they're back in the Dish-Pit.

The next step would be to check if the passkey is in a different location. But according to the initial instructions, the passkey is on the floor of the cookhouse. However, when the user tried to pick it up in the Cookhouse, it wasn't there. Maybe the passkey is in another room, or perhaps the user needs to explore more.

But the current room is Dish-Pit. The exits are east and north. The user has been looping between Dish-Pit and Cookhouse. The previous action was going west from Cookhouse to Dish-Pit. Now, in Dish-Pit, the exits are east and north. The user needs to find the passkey. Since the initial instruction said to pick it up from the cookhouse's floor, maybe the user needs to check the Cookhouse again. But when they were there before, the passkey wasn't there. Maybe the passkey is in the Studio? Or perhaps the user needs to check other rooms.

Wait, the user's goal was to go south, east, north, then pick up the passkey. But they might have missed a step. Alternatively, maybe the passkey is in the Dish-Pit. But the initial instruction said it's in the cookhouse. However, the user might need to check all possible locations. Since the user is in the Dish-Pit now, maybe they should go east to the next room. The exit to the east is unguarded. So the next action should be to go east from Dish-Pit. That would take them to the next room, perhaps the Cookhouse again, but maybe there's a different path. Alternatively, going north from Dish-Pit would take them back to the Cookhouse. But the user needs to find the passkey. Since the passkey was supposed to be in the Cookhouse, maybe they need to check there again. However, when they were there before, they couldn't find it. Maybe the passkey is in the Studio? The user has been in the Studio before. Alternatively, maybe the passkey is in the Spare Room. But the initial instruction said to pick it up from the cookhouse. 

Wait, the user's last action was going west from Cookhouse to Dish-Pit. Now, in Dish-Pit, the exits are east and north. The user needs to find the passkey. Since the passkey was supposed to be in the Cookhouse, maybe the user needs to check the Cookhouse again. But when they were there before, they couldn't find it. Maybe the passkey is in a different location. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to explore the east exit from Dish-Pit. The east exit is unguarded, so going east would be the next step. That would take them to a new room, perhaps the Cookhouse again, but maybe another room. The user needs to proceed east to check if the passkey is there. So the next action is go east.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in TextWorld. The goal is to pick up the passkey from the cookery. Let me recap the steps so far.

Starting in the Spare Room, they went south to the Dish-Pit, then east to the Cookhouse. In the Cookhouse, they tried going west but ended up back in the Dish-Pit again. Now they're in the Cookhouse again after going east from the Dish-Pit. The key is in the cookery, which is the Cookhouse. But they haven't found it yet.

Wait, the initial instruction said to go south, then east, then north, then pick up the passkey. But in the current state, they're in the Cookhouse again. Maybe they need to check the room for the passkey. But when they tried to pick it up earlier, it wasn't there. Maybe they need to look around more carefully. Alternatively, perhaps the passkey is in a different location. But according to the initial task, it's on the floor of the cookery. So maybe they need to check the Cookhouse again. However, the previous attempt to pick it up failed. Maybe they need to try a different action, like looking for the key instead of just picking it up. But the system only allows short commands. The next step would be to check the room again or try another direction. But since they're already in the Cookhouse, maybe the passkey is there, and they just need to pick it up again. But the system said they can't see it. Hmm. Maybe they need to go north from the Cookhouse to reach the Studio again, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe the passkey is in the Dish-Pit? No, the initial instruction says cookery. Wait, maybe the cookery is the Cookhouse. So they need to look for the passkey in the Cookhouse. But when they tried to pick it up, it wasn't there. Maybe they need to use a different command, like 'look around' or 'check floor', but the allowed commands are limited. The user's last action was 'go east', which brought them back to the Cookhouse. So the next step is to try picking up the passkey again, but the system says it's not there. Maybe they need to find another way. Alternatively, maybe the passkey is in the Studio. But the initial task says to pick it up from the cookery. This is confusing. The user needs to follow the steps: go south, east, north, then pick up the key. But they're stuck in a loop between Cookhouse and Dish-Pit. So the next action should be to try picking up the passkey again, even though it didn't work before. Alternatively, maybe the correct command is 'pick up passkey' again. But the system said they can't see it. Maybe they need to look for it again. But the allowed command is 'pick up passkey'. So the next action is to try that again.

SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's try to figure out what's going on here. The user is in a text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and pick up a passkey. The goal seems to be to reach the cookhouse and pick up the passkey from the floor.

Looking at the history, the user has been moving between rooms: starting in the spare room, then the dish-pit, cookhouse, studio, and back and forth. The main challenge is that whenever they try to pick up the passkey, they get a message saying they can't see it. 

So, maybe the passkey is only visible once they're in a specific room or after completing certain steps. Let's check the rooms again. The cookhouse was mentioned multiple times. In the cookhouse, there's a note about an unguarded exit to the west and north. But the user tried going west and east, ending up back in the cookhouse.

Wait, the initial instruction said to go south, then east, then north, then pick up the passkey in the cookhouse. But the user kept getting stuck in loops between the cookhouse and dish-pit. Maybe the passkey is in the dish-pit? But the user tried picking it up in the cookhouse and failed.

Alternatively, perhaps the passkey is in the studio? But the user hasn't checked there yet. Wait, the studio was mentioned as a room where they could go north or south. Maybe the passkey is in the studio? But the initial instructions didn't mention that.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to find the passkey in the dish-pit. The dish-pit has an exit to the east and north. When the user was in the dish-pit, they tried going east and then back. But the passkey wasn't there.

Wait, the initial task said: "make an effort to go north. With that done, pick-up the passkey from the floor of the cookery." So the cookery is the cookhouse. So the passkey is in the cookhouse's floor. But when the user tried to pick it up, they couldn't. Maybe they need to look around more or check the items in the cookhouse.

But the game's response says "You can't see any such thing." So maybe the passkey is not in the cookhouse. Maybe the user needs to check other rooms. Alternatively, maybe the passkey is in the dish-pit. But the user hasn't checked there yet.

Wait, the user was in the dish-pit and tried to go east, then back. The dish-pit's description doesn't mention a passkey. The cookhouse's description does mention a passkey, but the user can't pick it up. Maybe the passkey is in the studio? But the studio's description doesn't mention it.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to find the passkey in the spare room. The spare room had a keycard on the floor. Wait, the initial prompt said to pick up the passkey from the cookery, but maybe the keycard is a different item. But the user is confused.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go back to the spare room and pick up the keycard, then use it to open a door in the cookhouse. But the initial instruction didn't mention that. The user's previous actions were moving between rooms without finding the passkey.

So, the next step would be to check if the passkey is in the studio or another room. But the user is stuck in a loop between the cookhouse and dish-pit. The user needs to find a way to get out of the loop and check other areas. Maybe the passkey is in the studio, so the user should go north from the cookhouse to the studio and check there. But the user hasn't tried that yet.

Wait, in the cookhouse, the user can go north or west. Going north leads to the studio. So maybe the passkey is in the studio. The user should try going north from the cookhouse to the studio and look for the passkey there. That would be the next step.

This might come as a shock to you, but you've just entered a studio.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

The user's previous actions include going south, east, north, west, and trying to pick up the passkey. The game seems to loop between the cookhouse and dish-pit. The challenge is to find the passkey without getting stuck in a loop. Since the passkey isn't visible in the cookhouse, perhaps they need to check another room or use a different approach. Maybe the passkey is in the dish-pit or another area. Alternatively, there might be a hidden item or a specific command to retrieve it. The next step would be to explore other directions or look for clues in the current room.

Okay, let's try to figure out what's going on here. The user is in a text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and pick up a passkey. The goal seems to be to reach the passkey in the cookhouse, but every time they try to pick it up, it's not there.

Looking at the history, the player has been moving between rooms: starting in the spare room, then the dish-pit, cookhouse, studio, and back again. The passkey was mentioned to be on the floor of the cookery (cookhouse), but when they tried to pick it up, it wasn't there. Maybe the passkey is in a different location now, or perhaps they need to explore more thoroughly.

The user's previous actions include going south, east, north, west, and trying to pick up the passkey. The game seems to loop between the cookhouse and studio, so maybe the player is stuck in a cycle. The instruction says to avoid repeating actions if they aren't making progress. Since picking up the passkey isn't working, maybe they need to check other rooms or look for clues.

Wait, in the cookhouse, there's a mention of an unguarded exit to the north and west. The studio has exits to north, south, and west. Maybe the passkey is in another room they haven't checked yet. Alternatively, perhaps the passkey is in the dish-pit or spare room. But the user hasn't checked those areas again.

Alternatively, maybe the passkey is in the studio. The user was in the studio, but didn't look for it. The instruction says to pick up the passkey from the cookery (cookhouse), but maybe the player needs to check other locations. However, the game's feedback says the passkey isn't visible, so perhaps they need to look more carefully or find a different way in.

Since the player is stuck in a loop between cookhouse and studio, the next step might be to try a different direction. In the studio, the exits are north, south, west. The user tried going south (back to cookhouse) and west (to studio again). Maybe trying north from the studio? But the studio's north exit is unblocked. However, the user hasn't tried that yet. Alternatively, maybe the passkey is in the studio, and the player needs to check there.

But the initial goal was to pick up the passkey from the cookery. Maybe the player needs to find another way to get to the cookhouse again. Alternatively, maybe the passkey is in the dish-pit. The user was in the dish-pit earlier, but didn't pick it up. However, the game says the passkey is in the cookhouse. So perhaps the player needs to find a way to get to the cookhouse again and check again, but the passkey is not there anymore.

Wait, maybe the passkey was moved or hidden. The user needs to find another way. Since the player is stuck in a loop, the next action should be to try a different direction. In the studio, going north might be the next step. But the user tried going north before and ended up in the studio again. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check the west exit from the studio, which is unblocked. But that leads back to the cookhouse.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to look for the passkey in the studio. The game didn't mention it there, but maybe it's there. However, the initial instruction said to pick it up from the cookery. So perhaps the user needs to find another way to get to the cookhouse and check again. But the passkey isn't there. Maybe the user needs to find a different path.

In summary, the user is stuck in a loop between cookhouse and studio. The next step should be to try a different direction, perhaps going west from the studio to the cookhouse again, but that's what they've done before. Alternatively, maybe the passkey is in the studio, and the user needs to check there. But the game says they can't see it. So the next action might be to go north from the studio, even though it's unblocked, to see if that leads to a new area. But the user hasn't tried that yet.

There is a passkey on the floor.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in TextWorld. The goal is to pick up the passkey from the cookery's floor. Let me recap the steps taken so far.

Starting from the spare room, they went south to the dish-pit, then east to the cookhouse. In the cookhouse, they tried going north and west, but didn't find the passkey. Then they looped between the cookhouse, dish-pit, and studio. Finally, they arrived at the cookery room, where the passkey is now mentioned on the floor.

So the current step is to pick up the passkey. But in the previous attempt, when they tried "pick up passkey" in the cookhouse, it didn't work. Now, in the cookery room, the passkey is present. So the correct action here is to pick it up. The user needs to execute that command again here, since the room has changed. The previous mistake was trying to pick it up in the wrong room. Now, in the cookery room, the passkey is there, so "pick up passkey" should work. Let me confirm the room description again. Yes, the cookery room says there's a passkey on the floor. So the next action is to pick it up.
