THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to first go east, then north, then west, then north again, then west, and finally pick up the latchkey from the kitchen.

So far, the user has gone east from the basement to the garage, then north to the laundry place, then east again to the cookhouse, then tried to go north but couldn't, so they went west back to the laundry place. Now they're stuck in a loop between the laundry place and cookhouse.

The next step should be to go south from the laundry place instead of east. Because the prompt said if you need an unblocked exit, try going south. That should lead them out of the loop and towards the kitchen. Then they can proceed to pick up the latchkey.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Garage and Laundry Place. They keep going north and south, which isn't moving them towards the kitchen where the latchkey is. The original goal was to go east, then north, west, north, west, then get the latchkey.

So far, they've done the first east, then north to garage, then tried to go east again but got stuck. Now they're looping between garage and laundry. The problem is that the path isn't leading them towards the kitchen. Maybe they need to find another exit or look for clues. The durian is in the laundry place, but that's not helpful. The coffer in the basement might be a red herring. The key is to break the loop by trying a different direction. Instead of going north or south, maybe they need to go west from the garage. Wait, the garage has an exit to the west. Maybe that leads to the basement again, but the user already been there. Alternatively, maybe the laundry place's west portal is the way to go. But the user tried that and got stuck. Hmm. The next step should be to try a different action, like going west from the garage instead of north. That might escape the loop. So the command would be go west.

You are in a cubicle. An ordinary one.

Were you looking for a toolbox? Because look over there, it's a toolbox. The toolbox is empty, what a horrible day!

There is an open portal leading east. There is an open hatch leading north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

You're now in the kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You smell a sickening smell, and follow it to a freezer. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You make out a closed case, which looks normal, in the corner. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a table. The table is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open gateway leading east. There is an open passageway leading north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

There is a latchkey on the floor.
