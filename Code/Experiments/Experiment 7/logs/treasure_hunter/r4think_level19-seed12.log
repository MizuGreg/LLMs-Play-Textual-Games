It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First thing I need you to do is to travel south. Next, travel west. That done, pick-up the fly larva from the floor of the cookhouse. That's it!

-= Study =-
Of every study you could have walked into, you had to come round an usual one. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You see a locked coffer. You make out a trunk. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You scan the room for a stand, and you find a stand. The stand is typical. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is a closed gate leading west. There is an open gateway leading east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and collect an item. The goal is to pick up the fly larva from the cookhouse.

First, I need to recap the goal. The user has to travel south, then west, and pick up the fly larva. So far, the user has gone south twice and north twice, which seems like they're looping between the Study and Vault rooms. 

Looking at the current state, the Study room has a locked coffer, a trunk, a stand, and exits to west and east. The Vault has a suitcase, a counter, and exits to north and west. The user is stuck in a loop between these two rooms because every time they go south, they end up back in the Study, and going north takes them to the Vault again.

The next step should be to find a way to progress beyond these rooms. The user needs to reach the cookhouse. Since the initial instructions said to go south then west, maybe the cookhouse is west of the Study room. But the Study's west exit is closed. However, the Vault has an unguarded exit to the west. Maybe the user should go west from the Vault instead of the Study. 

Wait, the user tried going west from the Study but it's closed. So perhaps the correct path is to go west from the Vault. But the Vault's west exit is unguarded. So the user should go west from the Vault to reach the cookhouse. Then, in the cookhouse, pick up the fly larva. 

But the user hasn't tried that yet. So the next action should be to go west from the current location, which is the Vault. That's the next step to break the loop and proceed towards the cookhouse.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to pick up the fly larva from the cookhouse. The steps mentioned were: go south, then west, then pick up the larva.

Looking at the history, the user tried going south, then north, then south again, getting stuck in a loop between Study and Vault. Then they tried opening the west gate in Study, which worked. Now, after opening the gate, the next step should be to move west through the newly opened gate. But the user might be stuck again if the path isn't clear. However, since the gate is now open, moving west should lead to the next room. The next action would be to go west again to reach the cookhouse and pick up the larva. Since the previous action was opening the gate, the next logical step is to proceed west. No loops here, so the command is straightforward.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to get the fly larva from the cookhouse. They've been moving between rooms, but keep looping between the Launderette and Salon. The goal was to go south, then west, then pick up the larva.

Earlier, they opened the west gate in the Study, which led them to the Launderette. Then they went east to the Salon, but that's not helpful. Now they're back in the Launderette again. The problem is that the path to the cookhouse isn't clear. The Study's west gate was closed, but after opening it, they went west to the Launderette, then east to the Salon, then back west. So they're stuck in a loop between those two rooms.

The next step should be to find a way out of this loop. The Salon has an exit to the east, but that's where they came from. The Launderette has a gate east and a portal south. The portal south is closed. Maybe they need to find another way. Wait, the initial instruction was to go south first. Maybe the cookhouse is south of the Study, but the west gate was closed. But after opening it, they went west, which led them away from the Study. Maybe they need to go south from the Salon? But the Salon's exit is east. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the cookhouse is in the Salon. The user needs to check if the safe or bar there has the larva. But the safe is empty, and the bar is empty. So that's not it. The user must be going in the wrong direction. The original plan was to go south, then west. But after opening the gate, they went west, which might not be the right path. Maybe they should go south from the Salon instead of east. But the Salon's exit is only east. Wait, the Salon's description says there's an exit to the east, unblocked. So maybe the cookhouse is elsewhere.

Wait, the user's goal is to pick up the fly larva from the cookhouse. So they need to find the cookhouse. The initial steps were to go south, then west. But after opening the gate, they went west, which might not be the right direction. Maybe the cookhouse is south of the Study, but the west gate was closed. So perhaps they need to find another way to get to the cookhouse. But they're stuck in a loop. The next action should be to try going south from the Salon, but there's no south exit. The Salon's exit is east. So maybe they need to go east again, but that's where they came from. This is confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the cookhouse is in the Vault. But the Vault's west exit is unguarded. Wait, earlier when they were in the Vault, they could go west. But after opening the Study's west gate, they went to the Launderette. Maybe they need to go back to the Vault. But how? The current location is the Salon. The exit is east to the Launderette. So going east back to the Launderette, then maybe west to the Vault? But the Vault's west exit is unguarded. Wait, the Vault's description says there's an unguarded exit to the west. So maybe from the Launderette, go west to the Vault, then west again to the cookhouse. But the user is in the Salon now. So the path is Salon -> East to Launderette -> West to Vault -> West to cookhouse. Then pick up the larva. But the user hasn't tried that yet. So the next step is to go east from the Salon to the Launderette, then west to the Vault, then west again. But the user is in the Salon, so the next command is to go east.

Looking at the history, the user has been looping between the Salon and Launderette. They tried going east and west repeatedly, which isn't helping. The key is to break this loop and find the correct path to the cookhouse.

The initial steps mentioned were to go south, then west. But after opening the gate in the Study, the user went west to the Launderette, then east to the Salon, then back west. This loop suggests that the user is stuck between these two rooms. The problem might be that the correct path is south from the Salon, but the Salon only has an exit to the east. Wait, maybe the cookhouse is in the Vault, and the user needs to get there through the west exit of the Vault. But how?

Earlier, the Vault had an unguarded exit to the west. So maybe the user needs to go from the Salon east to the Launderette, then west to the Vault, then west again to reach the cookhouse. But the user is currently in the Salon, so the next step should be to go east to the Launderette, then west to the Vault, and then west again. However, the user is stuck in a loop between Salon and Launderette. The correct action here is to go east from the Salon to break the loop and proceed to the Vault.

THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

<think>
Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is stuck in a loop between the Salon and Launderette. The goal is to get the fly larva from the cookhouse by going south then west. But the user has been going back and forth between these two rooms without progress.

First, the goal steps are: go south, then west, then pick up the larva. So far, the user has opened a gate and moved between rooms but hasn't reached the cookhouse. The problem is that the correct path might be through the Vault's west exit. But the user is stuck in a loop, so they need to break it.

The user is in the Salon, which has an exit to the east. Going east leads back to the Launderette, which has a gate east and a closed portal south. The closed portal south might be the way to go, but the user hasn't tried it yet. Maybe the cookhouse is south of the Launderette. So the next step should be to go south from the Launderette through the closed portal, even though it's closed. But the user needs to open it first. Wait, but the user hasn't tried that. Alternatively, maybe the cookhouse is in the Vault, and the user needs to get there from the Salon by going east to Launderette, then west to Vault, then west again. But the user is stuck in a loop, so they need to find a different approach. The key is to stop looping and find the correct path. The next action should be to go south from the Launderette through the closed portal, even if it's closed, but the user needs to open it. However, the user hasn't tried opening it yet. So the next command is to go south.

-= Cookhouse =-
You're now in the cookhouse.

You can make out a locked case, which looks usual, in the room.

There is an open portal leading north. There is an open hatch leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a fly larva on the floor.
