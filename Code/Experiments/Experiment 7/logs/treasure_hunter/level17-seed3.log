-= Canteen =-
You find yourself in a canteen. An usual one. You start to take note of what's in the room.



You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user wants me to lift the worm from the floor of the kitchenette. So the main goal is to pick up the worm.

Looking at the previous steps, the user has moved through several rooms: canteen, playroom, basement, bedroom, bar, laundromat, and now the kitchenette. The current room is the kitchenette, where the worm is on the floor. 

The user's last action was going west, which led them to the kitchenette. Now, they need to interact with the worm. The prompt mentions there's a worm on the floor, so the next logical step is to pick it up. The command should be something like "take worm" or "lift worm". Since the game might expect a specific verb, "take" is more common than "lift". Let me check the previous commands. The user has been using "go" commands, so maybe "take worm" is the right action here. I need to make sure there's no loop. Since the user is in the kitchenette for the first time, and the worm is present, this should be the correct step.
</think>take worm
