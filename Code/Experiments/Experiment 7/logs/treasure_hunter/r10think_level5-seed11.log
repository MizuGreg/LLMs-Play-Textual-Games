I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! First of all, you could, like, try to go west. If you can manage that, attempt to go to the south. Then, retrieve the laptop from the floor of the studio. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Sauna =-
You've just shown up in a sauna.



There is an unguarded exit to the west.

go west
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unblocked exit to the south.
