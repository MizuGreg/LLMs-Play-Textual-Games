THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game called TextWorld, and their task is to follow a series of steps to reach the goal. The goal is to eventually pick up the latchkey from the closet and exit.

First, I need to recall the steps they've already taken. The initial steps were: go north, open the hatch in the cubicle, go west, go north again, open the passageway in the sauna, go north again, open the walnut gate, and then go west. Now they're in the bathroom, having opened the walnut gate.

Looking at the current location, the bathroom has a cabinet, a drawer, a trunk, an open passageway south, and a closed walnut gate west. Wait, they just opened the walnut gate, so maybe that's part of the next step. The next step in the original task was to travel west after ensuring the walnut gate is open. So after opening the walnut gate, they should go west.

But the user's last action was opening the walnut gate, and the current location is the bathroom. The next step according to the task is to go west from the bathroom. However, the bathroom has a closed walnut gate leading west. Wait, but they just opened it. So maybe after opening it, they can go west. But the current description says there's a closed walnut gate leading west. Wait, no, the user just opened it, so it should be open now. Let me check the previous messages.

The user's last action was "open walnut gate", and the response was "You open walnut gate." Then the current location is the bathroom, with a closed walnut gate leading west. Wait, that doesn't make sense. If they just opened it, it should be open. Maybe there's a mistake in the game's response. Alternatively, maybe the walnut gate is now open, so they can go west. The next step in the task is to travel west after opening the walnut gate. So the next action should be "go west".

But the user is in the bathroom, and the next step is to go west. However, the bathroom's description says there's a closed walnut gate leading west. But the user just opened it. Maybe the game's description is outdated. Alternatively, maybe the walnut gate is now open, so they can go west. So the next action is "go west".

After going west, they should reach the closet where the latchkey is. Then they need to pick it up. So the next step is to go west from the bathroom. The user's last action was opening the walnut gate, so the next step is to go west. Therefore, the correct command is "go west".

-= Office =-
You've just sauntered into an office.



There is an open walnut gate leading east. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

-= Closet =-
You find yourself in a closet. An ordinary one. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You see a stand. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north.

There is a latchkey on the floor.
