It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First of all, ensure that the portal within the studio is open. After that, attempt to travel north. Then, retrieve the latchkey from the floor of the cubicle. Alright, thanks!

-= Studio =-
You've just walked into a studio.

You can make out a closed coffer. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. The table is normal. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.

There is a closed portal leading north. There is an open gateway leading west.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop where they keep trying to open the portal north, but the system isn't recognizing it. The goal is to open the portal, then go north, get the latchkey.

First, I need to make sure the portal is opened. The user tried "open portal north" multiple times, but the system keeps saying it only understood up to opening the portal. Maybe the correct command is just "open portal" without specifying north, since the portal is already leading north. 

Wait, the initial instruction said to ensure the portal is open, then go north. So maybe the first step is to open the portal. The user tried that, but the system didn't acknowledge it. Maybe the correct command is "open portal" instead of "open portal north". 

Then, after opening the portal, the next step is to go north. But the user is stuck in a loop because they keep trying to open the portal again. So the next action should be to go north once the portal is open. But since the system isn't recognizing the open portal command, maybe using a synonym like "activate portal" or "use portal" could work. Alternatively, maybe the correct command is just "go north" after opening the portal. 

But the user's last action was "open portal north" again. The system is not recognizing that. So the next step is to try a different command, perhaps "open portal" without specifying direction. Then, once the portal is open, go north. Then retrieve the latchkey. So the next action should be "open portal" to break the loop.

-= Cubicle =-
This might come as a shock to you, but you've just stumbled into a cubicle. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You see a bureau.

There is an open portal leading south. There is an open passageway leading east.

There is a latchkey on the floor.
