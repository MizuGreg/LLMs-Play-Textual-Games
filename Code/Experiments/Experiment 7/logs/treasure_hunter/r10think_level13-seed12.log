Welcome to TextWorld! Your first objective is to make an effort to take a trip west. And then, go to the south. After that, head west. With that accomplished, lift the fly larva from the floor of the cookhouse. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Cubicle =-
Well, here we are in a cubicle. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.



There is an open door leading south. There is an open gateway leading west.

-= Study =-
Of every study you could have walked into, you had to come round an usual one. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You see a locked coffer. You make out a trunk. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You scan the room for a stand, and you find a stand. The stand is typical. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is an open gateway leading east. There is an open gate leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in the Salon room. They tried going west but can't, then tried south and west again. The goal is to go west, then south, then west again, then lift the fly larva from the cookhouse.

So far, the user has gone west from Cubicle to Study, then West to Launderette, then West to Salon. Now they're in Salon and can't go west. The next steps after Salon would be to go south, but the user tried that and couldn't. Maybe there's a different exit? The Salon has an exit to the east, but that's not helpful. Wait, the user needs to go south from the Salon. But the previous attempts to go south failed. Maybe the user needs to check other objects in the Salon. The safe is empty, the bar is empty. Maybe there's a key or something else. But the game's description doesn't mention any items except the safe and bar. The user needs to find a way to proceed. Since going west isn't possible, maybe the correct path is to go south from the Salon, but the user can't. Maybe the user needs to look for a different way, like using the safe or bar? But the safe is empty. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east first, but that's not part of the plan. Wait, the original plan was to go west, then south, then west. So after Salon, the next step should be south. But the user can't go south. Maybe the user is in a loop. The previous steps were going west each time, but now stuck. So the next action should be to go south, even if it says can't. Or maybe the user needs to find another exit. But the Salon only has east and west exits. Wait, the Salon's description says there's an exit to the east, but the user is supposed to go south. Maybe the user needs to check if there's a way to go south through another means. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the safe or bar to get a key. But the safe is empty. Hmm. The user needs to break the loop. Since going west isn't possible, maybe the correct action is to go south, even if it says can't. Or maybe the user needs to use a different command, like 'look' to find something. But the game's instructions say to output a command like 'go south'. So the next step is to go south, even if it's blocked. Or maybe the user needs to find a way to proceed by using the bar or safe. But the safe is empty. Maybe the user needs to check the bar. But the bar is empty. So the only option is to go south, even if it's blocked. Wait, the user tried going south and it said can't. Maybe the user needs to try another direction. But the only exits are east and west. Wait, the Salon has an exit to the east, but the user's plan is to go south. Maybe the user is in a loop and needs to find another way. The next action should be to go south, even if it's blocked. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east first, then find a way back. But that's not part of the original plan. The original plan was west, south, west. So after Salon, the next step is south. But the user can't. So maybe the user needs to go east, then south, then west. But that's not the original path. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to find a way to proceed by using the safe or bar. But the safe is empty. The bar is empty. So the user is stuck. The next action should be to go south, even if it's blocked. Or maybe the user needs to use a different command. But the game requires a command like 'go south'. So the answer is to go south.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is stuck in a loop between the Salon and Launderette. The goal is to go west, then south, then west again, and lift the fly larva from the cookhouse.

So far, the user has gone west three times: Cubicle → Study → Launderette → Salon. Now they're back in Salon, trying to go south but can't.

But the original plan was to go south from Salon. However, the user can't go south, so maybe they need to check the safe or bar for something. But the safe is empty, and the bar is empty. 

Wait, the user's goal is to lift the fly larva from the cookhouse. Maybe they need to reach the cookhouse first. But how? The current path isn't leading there. Perhaps the user needs to find a different route, like going east from Salon, then south, then west. But the user tried that and got stuck again.

The key is to break the loop. Since going west from Salon isn't possible, maybe the correct action is to go east, then south, then west. But the user has already tried that. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to look for a key or item in the Salon that allows them to proceed. But the safe is empty. 

The next action should be to go east again, then try south. But the user is in a loop, so they need to try a different command. The answer is to go east, then south, then west. But the user is stuck in the loop, so the next command should be to go east.

Wait, the user's goal is to lift the fly larva from the cookhouse. Maybe they need to reach the cookhouse first. But how? The current path isn't leading there. Perhaps the user needs to find a different route, like going east from Salon, then south, then west. But the user has already tried that. 

The key is to break the loop. Since going west from Salon isn't possible, maybe the correct action is to go east, then south, then west. But the user is stuck in the loop, so the next command should be to go east.

You arrive in a launderette. A typical kind of place.

You can see a bench. The bench is ordinary. However, the bench, like an empty bench, has nothing on it.

There is an open gate leading east. There is an open portal leading south. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Salon and Launderette. The goal is to go west, then south, then west again, and lift the fly larva from the cookhouse.

So far, the user has gone west three times: Cubicle → Study → Launderette → Salon. Now they're back in Salon, trying to go south but can't. The previous attempts to go west from Salon failed, so they tried east, which took them back to Launderette, then west again to Salon. This loop suggests they're stuck between these two rooms.

The next step should be to find another way out. Since the Salon has an exit to the east, maybe they need to go east first, then find a different path. But the original plan was to go south from Salon. However, the user can't go south, so maybe they need to check the safe or bar for something. But the safe is empty, and the bar is empty.

Of every study you could have walked into, you had to come round an usual one. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You see a locked coffer. You make out a trunk. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You scan the room for a stand, and you find a stand. The stand is typical. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is an open gateway leading east. There is an open gate leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Cookhouse and needs to lift the fly larva from the floor. They tried "lift fly larva from floor" but it's not recognized. The correct command should be "lift the fly larva from the floor" with the article "the".

So, the goal is to lift the larva. The user has already reached the Cookhouse, which is the fourth step. The next step is to use the correct command with "the". Since the previous attempts didn't work, the user needs to try again with the correct phrasing.

Okay, the user is stuck in the Cookhouse and needs to lift the fly larva. They've tried "lift the fly larva from the floor" multiple times, but it's not working. The game might be expecting a different phrasing. Let me check the previous steps.

The user reached the Cookhouse by going west from the Vault. The goal was to lift the larva from the floor. The correct command might be "lift the fly larva" without specifying the floor, or maybe "pick up the fly larva". Since the game says "That's not a verb I recognise", maybe the correct verb is "pick up" instead of "lift". Let me try that.
