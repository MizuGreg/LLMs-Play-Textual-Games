It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First off, try to go east. After that, ensure that the portal inside the spare room is open. After that, venture north. Then, doublecheck that the gate is open. After that, make an effort to go to the east. Then, recover the stick of butter from the floor of the cubicle. Got that? Good!

-= Bedchamber =-
You are in a bedchamber. A normal one.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Spare Room =-
You arrive in a spare room. A standard kind of place.

You make out a toolbox. The toolbox is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a coffer. Oh, great. Here's a display. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. This always happens!

There is a closed portal leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

There is a passkey on the floor.
