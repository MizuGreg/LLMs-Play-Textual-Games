I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First off, try to head east. That done, travel north. Then, lift the passkey from the floor of the spare room. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Steam Room =-
You arrive in a steam room. A standard kind of place.

You see a box. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is typical. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is an unguarded exit to the east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

-= Laundry Place =-
You find yourself in a laundry place. A normal kind of place. You start to take note of what's in the room.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text-based game where they need to follow specific steps to complete their task. The goal is to first go east, then north, lift the passkey from the spare room's floor, and then stop.

Looking at the current environment, the user is in the Laundry Place. The previous action was "go east", which led them here. Now, the prompt says to try going north or west. The user's next step should be to go north as per the initial instructions. But wait, the user's task was to go east first, then north. So after going east to the Laundry Place, the next step is to go north. However, the current room's description says that going north is unblocked. So the next logical step is to go north. But the user might be in a loop if they keep moving between rooms without progress. However, since the goal is to reach the spare room and lift the passkey, the user needs to navigate to the spare room. The Laundry Place might be part of the path. So the next action should be to go north from the Laundry Place. But the user has to check if that's the correct direction. The initial instructions said after going east, go north. So the next step is indeed north. The user hasn't lifted the passkey yet, so they need to proceed to the spare room. Therefore, the next action is to go north.

-= Spare Room =-
I never took you for the sort of person who would show up in a spare room, but I guess I was wrong.



There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

There is a passkey on the floor.

Okay, let me try to figure out the next steps here. The user's goal is to first go east, then north, lift the passkey from the spare room, and then stop. So far, they've gone east from the Steam Room to the Laundry Place, then north to the Spare Room. Now, in the Spare Room, they need to pick up the passkey on the floor. The current command should be to pick up the passkey. But the system might expect a different verb, like 'take' instead of 'lift'. Let me check the previous actions. The user was told to "lift the passkey from the floor of the spare room." So the correct action here is 'lift', but maybe the game uses 'take' instead. Wait, in the initial instruction, the user is told to "lift the passkey", so maybe 'lift' is the right command. But sometimes games use 'take' for picking up items. However, the user's previous action was 'go east' and 'go north', so the next logical step is to pick up the passkey. The command should be 'lift passkey' or 'take passkey'. Since the problem statement says "lift the passkey", I should use 'lift'. But maybe the game expects 'take'. Hmm. Let me think. The user is in the Spare Room, and the passkey is on the floor. The correct action is to pick it up. The command should be 'lift passkey' as per the initial instruction. So the next action is 'lift passkey'.
</think>lift passkey

That's not a verb I recognise.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to complete the game by following specific steps. The goal is to go east, then north, lift the passkey from the spare room, and then stop.

First, they started in the Steam Room, went east to the Laundry Place, then north to the Spare Room. Now, in the Spare Room, they need to lift the passkey. But the system said "That's not a verb I recognise," so "lift passkey" is invalid.

Hmm, maybe the correct command is to pick up the passkey. In TextWorld, sometimes "take" is used instead of "lift." Let me check the previous interactions. The user tried "lift passkey" and it didn't work. So perhaps the correct verb is "take." Alternatively, maybe "get" or "pick up."

But the user's past actions were: go east, go north, then the next step was to lift the passkey. Since that failed, the next step is to use a different verb. The key is to find the right command to pick up the passkey. The correct command here is likely "take passkey" or "get passkey." Since the system didn't accept "lift," switching to "take" might work. So the next action should be "take passkey."
</think>take passkey
