You are now playing a fast paced session of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, you could, like, ensure that the hatch within the cellar is open. After that, move south. Then, ensure that the portal within the basement is open. After that, head south. And then, move west. With that done, attempt to move north. And then, go to the west. Once you get around to doing that, pick up the peanut from the floor of the studio. Alright, thanks!

-= Cellar =-
I am pleased to announce that you are now in the cellar.



There is a closed hatch leading south. There is an open gate leading north.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in TextWorld. The main goal is to open certain hatch and portal, move in specific directions, and pick up a peanut.

First, the user was in the cellar. The task was to ensure the hatch south is open, then move south, then open the portal in the basement, move south again, then west, and finally pick up the peanut in the studio.

But the user tried "ensure hatch open south" which the game didn't recognize. Then they tried "go south", but the game said they need to open the hatch first. So the user is stuck because they can't go south unless the hatch is open.

The user's past actions: They tried to open the hatch but the command wasn't recognized. Then they tried to go south, but the game said the hatch is closed. So the next step is to figure out the correct way to open the hatch. Maybe the correct verb is "open" instead of "ensure". So the correct command should be "open hatch south".

Then, after opening the hatch, they can go south. Then proceed with the next steps: open the portal, move south, west, etc., and finally pick up the peanut.

So the next action should be "open hatch south".

Okay, let's break this down. The user is trying to navigate through a text-based game, following specific steps. The main goal is to open a hatch in the cellar, move south, open a portal in the basement, move south again, go west, then move north and west again to pick up a peanut in the studio.

Earlier, the user tried "ensure hatch open south," which the game didn't recognize. Then they tried "go south," but the game said the hatch was closed. The user then tried "open hatch south," but the game still didn't recognize it. Now, the user is stuck again.

First step: The goal is to open the south hatch in the cellar, then move south. But the game isn't recognizing "open hatch south." Maybe the correct command is just "open hatch" or "open the hatch south." Alternatively, maybe the hatch has a different name or the command needs to be more specific.

Second step: The user's past actions include trying to open the hatch but using incorrect verbs. They tried "ensure" which didn't work, then "go south" without opening the hatch. Now, they tried "open hatch south" again, but it's still not working. So the next step is to find the correct way to open the hatch.

Third step: The user is in a loop because the same action isn't working. They need to try a different synonym or phrasing. Maybe the correct command is "open hatch" without specifying south, or "open the hatch south." Alternatively, maybe the hatch is called something else, like "gate" or "door."

Finally, the next action should be to try a different command. Since "open hatch south" didn't work, perhaps "open hatch" or "open the hatch" is the correct command. Alternatively, check if the hatch is already open and if there's another way to proceed.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in a text adventure game. The main goal is to open certain hatch and portal, move in specific directions, and pick up a peanut.

So far, the user has opened the hatch in the cellar and moved south to the basement. In the basement, they need to open the portal leading south. But the user tried "open portal south" twice, and the game only recognized "open portal" but not "south". So the next step is to figure out the correct command to open the portal.

The user's past actions: Opened the cellar hatch, went south to basement, tried to open the south portal but the command wasn't recognized. Now, they need to find the right way to open the portal. Maybe the correct command is just "open portal" without specifying south, or perhaps "open the portal south". Alternatively, maybe the portal has a different name or the command needs to be more specific.

Since the game didn't recognize "open portal south" the second time, the user should try a different phrasing. Maybe "open portal" is sufficient, or "open the portal". The next action should be to try "open portal" again, using a synonym if necessary.

So far, the user has opened the hatch in the cellar, moved south to the basement, opened the portal, moved south again to the kitchenette, went west to the cubicle, then north to the steam room. Now, the next step according to the original plan was to move west again after going north. But in the steam room, the user can go west or south. The original plan was to move west after going north, but the user is now in the steam room. The next step would be to go west from the steam room. However, the user might be stuck if they can't find the peanut. But according to the steps, after moving west from the steam room, they should be able to proceed to the studio where the peanut is. So the next action is to go west.
