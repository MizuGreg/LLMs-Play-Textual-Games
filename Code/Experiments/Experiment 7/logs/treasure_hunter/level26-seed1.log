Welcome to another exciting episode of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First stop, take a trip west. Then, head north. If you can succeed at that, venture north. After that, attempt to venture east. And then, travel south. If you can succeed at that, pick-up the American latchkey from the floor of the studio. With the American latchkey, make an attempt to go south. And then, unlock the American gate with the American latchkey. Then, make it so that the American gate within the cubicle is ajar. After opening the American gate, make an attempt to go east. Then, travel east. After that, lift the keycard from the floor of the workshop. And if you do that, you're the winner!
