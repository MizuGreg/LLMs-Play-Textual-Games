You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Garden =-
You arrive in a garden. An ordinary kind of place. You begin looking for stuff.



There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door.

You've entered a backyard. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You see a patio chair. But there isn't a thing on it. You make out a patio table. The patio table is stylish. However, the patio table, like an empty patio table, has nothing on it. What's the point of an empty patio table? You can make out a closed BBQ.

There is a closed wooden door leading north. There is a closed screen door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal by finding a recipe in the kitchen. The game has them moving between the garden and backyard, but they keep going back and forth between north and south, which is causing a loop.

First, the goal is to find the cookbook in the kitchen, follow the recipe, and then enjoy the meal. So far, the user has been moving north and south repeatedly, which isn't helping them progress. They need to find the kitchen instead of just moving around the garden and backyard.

The previous actions have not led to any progress because they're stuck in a loop. The next step should be to look for the kitchen. Since the initial exit was to the north, maybe the kitchen is there. Alternatively, maybe the screen door west leads to the kitchen. But the user hasn't checked those doors yet. So instead of going north again, they should check the closed doors, like the wooden door north or the screen door west, to find the kitchen and access the cookbook.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to cook a meal by finding a recipe in the kitchen. So far, they've been moving between the garden and backyard, which isn't helping. They opened a wooden door leading to a shed, but that's not the kitchen yet.

First step: The goal is to find the cookbook in the kitchen, follow the recipe, and cook. So far, they've checked the backyard and shed but haven't found the kitchen. Next step is to look for the kitchen, maybe through the screen door west or the wooden door north.

Second step: Past actions include moving north and south, opening the wooden door, but no progress on the kitchen. Next step should be checking the screen door west or looking for the kitchen in the shed.

Third step: They're in a loop between garden and backyard. Need to break it by checking the screen door west or looking for the kitchen in the shed. The next action should be opening the screen door west or checking the shed's contents for the cookbook.

First step: The goal is to find the cookbook in the kitchen, follow the recipe, and cook. So far, they've checked the backyard, shed, but not the kitchen. Next step is to find the kitchen.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to find a cookbook to cook a meal. They've been moving around the garden and backyard, opening doors, but haven't found the kitchen yet. They're in the shed now, and their previous actions haven't yielded the cookbook.

First step: The goal is to find the cookbook in the kitchen, follow the recipe, and cook. So far, they've checked the backyard, shed, but not the kitchen. Next step is to find the kitchen.

Second step: Past actions include moving north/south, opening doors, looking around shed. No progress on kitchen. Next step is to check the wooden door north or screen door west again, maybe the kitchen is there.

Third step: They're stuck in a loop between garden and shed. Need to break it by checking the screen door west again or looking for the cookbook in the shed's contents. Since the screen door didn't work before, maybe check the wooden door north again. Alternatively, look for the cookbook in the shed's contents.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to find a cookbook to cook a meal. They've been moving around the garden and backyard, opening doors, but haven't found the kitchen yet. They're in the shed now, and their previous actions haven't yielded the cookbook.

First step: The goal is to find the cookbook in the kitchen, follow the recipe, and cook. So far, they've checked the backyard, shed, but not the kitchen. Next step is to find the kitchen.

Second step: Past actions include moving north/south, opening doors, looking around shed. No progress on kitchen. Next step is to check the wooden door north or screen door west again, maybe the kitchen is there.

Third step: They're stuck in a loop between garden and shed. Need to break it by checking the screen door west again or looking for the cookbook in the shed's contents. Since the screen door didn't work before, maybe check the wooden door north again. Alternatively, look for the cookbook in the shed's contents.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to find a cookbook to cook a meal. They've been moving around the garden and backyard, opening doors, but haven't found the kitchen yet. They're in the shed now, and their previous actions haven't yielded the cookbook.

First step: The goal is to find the cookbook in the kitchen, follow the recipe, and cook. So far, they've checked the backyard, shed, but not the kitchen. Next step is to find the kitchen.

Second step: Past actions include moving north/south, opening doors, looking around shed. No progress on kitchen. Next step is to check the wooden door north or screen door west again, maybe the kitchen is there.

Third step: They're stuck in a loop between garden and shed. Need to break it by checking the screen door west again or looking for the cookbook in the shed's contents. Since the screen door didn't work before, maybe check the wooden door north again. Alternatively, look for the cookbook in the shed's contents.
