THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Livingroom and Bedroom. The goal is to cook a meal using the cookbook in the kitchen. So far, they've been moving north and south repeatedly, which isn't helping.

First, I need to figure out why they're looping. The previous actions were going north from the Livingroom to the Bedroom, then south back to Livingroom, and repeating. That's not making progress towards the kitchen or the cookbook.

The next step should be to find the kitchen. Since the cookbook is in the kitchen, they need to get there. But how? The current rooms are Livingroom and Bedroom. Maybe there's another exit from the Bedroom or Livingroom that leads to the kitchen. The user hasn't checked other directions like east or west yet. 

Wait, the initial instruction said to check the cookbook in the kitchen. So maybe the kitchen is accessible from another room. The user has only tried north and south. Perhaps they need to look for other exits. Alternatively, maybe the bedroom has a different exit. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to find a way to open a door or use an object to get to the kitchen. But the current description doesn't mention any objects except the sofa and bed. 

Wait, the user is in the Bedroom, and the exit is to the north. But going south leads back to the Livingroom. So maybe the kitchen is in another direction. Maybe the user needs to look for a different path. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to find a way to get to the kitchen from the Livingroom. Since the Livingroom is described as ordinary, maybe there's a door or exit that's not mentioned. But the user hasn't tried east or west. 

So the next step should be to try moving east or west from the current room. Since the user is in the Bedroom, maybe there's an exit to the east or west that leads to the kitchen. Alternatively, maybe the Livingroom has an exit to the east that leads to the kitchen. 

But the user has been moving north and south, so they need to try different directions. The next action should be to try east or west. Let's check the previous steps. The user was in the Livingroom, then Bedroom, then back. So maybe the next step is to try east from the Bedroom or Livingroom. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to find the kitchen through a different method. But according to the game's setup, the cookbook is in the kitchen, so the user needs to get to the kitchen. 

So the correct next action is to try moving east or west from the current room. Since the user is in the Bedroom, maybe the exit is east. Let's try that.

If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's an oven. You can make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a counter? But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove appears to be empty. This always happens, here in TextWorld!

<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to cook a meal using the cookbook in the kitchen. They've already found the kitchen, took the cookbook, and started preparing the pork chop recipe.

Looking at the steps: the recipe says to chop the pork chop, fry it, dice the red onion, fry it, then prepare the meal. The user took the pork chop, but now they need to fry it. The problem is that the previous attempts to use "fry pork chop" didn't work. The system might expect a different phrasing, like using "pan" as an object.

Wait, in the kitchen, there's a stove and a pan mentioned. Maybe the correct action is to use the pan to fry the pork chop. So instead of just "fry pork chop," they need to specify the pan. But the user tried "fry pork chop in pan" and it didn't work. Maybe the correct command is "fry pork chop with pan" or "use pan to fry pork chop." Alternatively, maybe the system expects "cook pork chop" instead of "fry." But the recipe says "fry the pork chop," so maybe the correct verb is "fry."

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to first take the pan from the counter. But the pan isn't mentioned as being in the kitchen. Wait, the kitchen has a stove, but the pan might be on the counter. The user hasn't checked that yet. So maybe the next step is to take the pan first, then use it to fry the pork chop.

But the user is stuck on the "fry" command. The system might be expecting a different verb or a different structure. Since "fry pork chop" didn't work, maybe the correct action is "cook pork chop" instead. Let me check the previous steps. The user tried "cook pork chop" and it was invalid. Then they tried "fry pork chop," which also didn't work. The system might be expecting "use pan to fry pork chop" or "fry pork chop with pan."

Alternatively, maybe the correct action is "put pork chop in pan" and then "fry pan." But the recipe says to fry the pork chop, so maybe the user needs to use the pan to fry it. The key is to use the correct verb and object. Since "fry pork chop in pan" didn't work, maybe the correct command is "fry pork chop with pan" or "use pan to fry pork chop." But the system might not recognize that. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to first take the pan from the counter.

Wait, the user hasn't taken the pan yet. The kitchen has a counter, but the pan isn't mentioned as being there. The user might need to take the pan first. So the next step is to take the pan, then use it to fry the pork chop. But the user is currently at the step where they need to fry the pork chop. So the correct action would be to use the pan to fry the pork chop. But since the system didn't recognize "fry pork chop in pan," maybe the correct command is "fry pork chop with pan" or "use pan to fry pork chop." Alternatively, maybe the system expects "cook pork chop" instead of "fry."

But according to the recipe, the direction is to fry the pork chop. So the correct action is to fry it. The user needs to use the correct syntax. Maybe the correct command is "fry pork chop" without specifying the pan, but the system is expecting the pan to be used. Since the user hasn't taken the pan, maybe they need to take it first. So the next step is to take the pan from the counter, then fry the pork chop.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe. They have the pork chop and the red onion. The recipe says to chop the pork chop, fry it, dice the onion, fry it, then prepare the meal.

So far, they took the pork chop and the cookbook. They're stuck on the frying part. The system isn't recognizing commands like "fry pork chop with pan" or "fry pork chop in pan." Maybe the correct verb is "cook" instead of "fry"? Or maybe they need to use the stove instead of the pan.

Wait, the kitchen has a stove. Maybe the action is to use the stove to cook the pork chop. The user tried "fry" but maybe "cook" is the right verb. Alternatively, the system might expect "put pork chop on stove" and then "cook." But the recipe specifically says "fry," so maybe the correct command is "fry pork chop" without specifying the pan, but the system is expecting the pan to be used. Since the user can't find the pan, maybe they need to take it from the counter. But the system says they can't see the pan. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the correct action is "cook pork chop" instead of "fry." The user tried that earlier and it didn't work. But maybe the system is expecting that. Or perhaps the user needs to use the stove directly. Since the stove is in the kitchen, maybe "cook pork chop on stove" is the correct command. Let's try that.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to cook a meal using the cookbook in the kitchen. They've already followed the recipe steps: took the pork chop, chopped it, fried it, took the red onion, diced it, and now need to fry the onion.

The problem is that the system isn't recognizing commands like "fry red onion in pan" or "fry red onion with pan." Maybe the correct verb is "cook" instead of "fry"? Or perhaps they need to use the stove directly. The user tried "cook pork chop on stove" earlier and it worked, so maybe "cook red onion on stove" is the right command. Let's try that.

The user tried "cut pork chop with knife" multiple times, but the system says it only understood up to wanting to cut. Maybe the correct command is "cut the pork chop" without specifying the knife.
