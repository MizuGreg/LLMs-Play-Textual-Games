You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. A normal one. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You see a closed fridge. You can see a closed oven, which looks conventional, right there by you. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a knife. Hey, want to see a counter? Look over there, a counter. You see a banana and a cookbook on the counter. You can see a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is a closed frosted-glass door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe in the cookbook. The recipe requires banana, pork chop, white tuna. They've already taken the banana from the counter, and the pork chop and white tuna from the fridge. But they're carrying too many things, so they had to drop the pork chop. Now they need to proceed with the cooking steps.

The directions say to slice the banana, roast it, then do the same for the pork chop and white tuna. But the user is stuck because they can't carry all the items. They need to maybe drop one item to carry the others. Wait, they dropped the pork chop earlier. Now they have the banana, white tuna, and maybe the white onion? Wait, the white onion was taken from the fridge but they couldn't carry it because they were already carrying three items. Then they dropped the pork chop to free up space. Now they have the banana, white tuna, and maybe the white onion? Or did they drop the pork chop and keep the white onion?

Wait, the user took the white onion from the fridge but couldn't carry it because they were already carrying the banana, pork chop, and white tuna. So they had to drop the pork chop. Now they have the banana, white tuna, and the white onion? Or did they drop the pork chop and keep the white onion? The last action was putting the pork chop down, so now they have the banana, white tuna, and the white onion. But the recipe doesn't mention the white onion, so maybe that's a red herring.

The next step is to slice the banana. But the user needs to use the knife on the table. So they need to take the knife, then slice the banana. Then roast it. But the user hasn't taken the knife yet. So the next action should be to take the knife from the table. Then slice the banana. Then roast it. But the user is currently holding the white tuna and the banana. Wait, after dropping the pork chop, they have the banana and white tuna. Then they can take the knife, slice the banana, roast it, then proceed with the pork chop and white tuna. But the pork chop was dropped, so maybe they need to pick it up again. Wait, but the user can't carry all items. So maybe they need to drop the white tuna and take the pork chop again, but that's complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the user should first take the knife, then slice the banana. Then roast it. Then proceed with the pork chop and white tuna. But the user is currently holding the white tuna and the banana. Wait, no, after dropping the pork chop, they have the banana and white tuna. Then they can take the knife, slice the banana, roast it, then slice the pork chop (which they have to pick up again?), but they can't carry both. This is getting confusing. The key is to follow the recipe steps, but manage the items properly. The main issue is that the user can only carry so many items. So the next step is to take the knife from the table, then slice the banana. Then roast it. Then maybe proceed with the pork chop and white tuna, but need to manage the carrying capacity.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is trying to follow a recipe to cook a meal. The recipe requires slicing and roasting the banana, pork chop, and white tuna. So far, they've taken the banana, pork chop, and white tuna from the fridge and counter. They also took the knife and sliced the banana. Now, they need to roast the banana, but the system isn't recognizing "roast" as a verb. Maybe they need to use a different command, like "put in oven" or "cook in oven". Since the oven is available, perhaps the next step is to place the banana in the oven. But the user is holding the banana, so they need to put it in the oven. The previous attempts to use "roast" didn't work, so switching to "put in oven" might be the solution. That makes sense because the oven is the appliance used for roasting. So the next action should be putting the banana in the oven.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook according to the recipe. They've already taken the banana, pork chop, and white tuna. They sliced the banana and put it in the oven. But the system isn't recognizing "roast" as a verb. So maybe the correct action is to use the oven's function. Since the oven is open and the banana is inside, perhaps the next step is to close the oven again. Wait, but the recipe says to roast the banana, so maybe after putting it in the oven, they need to close it and then maybe check when it's done. But the user can't close the oven because they have the banana in there. Alternatively, maybe the oven has a roast function, so they need to activate it. But the system might not accept "roast" as a command. Maybe the correct action is to "close the oven" to simulate roasting. Or perhaps "cook the banana" is the correct verb. But the user tried "roast" and it didn't work. So maybe the next step is to close the oven after putting the banana in, assuming that closing it triggers the roasting process. Let me check the previous steps. The user put the banana in the oven, then tried to roast it, which didn't work. So maybe the correct action is to close the oven, which would be the next step. But the oven was already open. Wait, the user opened the oven, put the banana in, then tried to roast it. Maybe the oven needs to be closed to start roasting. So the next action should be closing the oven. But the user is holding the banana, so they need to put it in first. Wait, they already put it in. So maybe the next step is to close the oven. But the system might not recognize "close" as a verb. Alternatively, maybe "roast" is the correct verb, but the system is having issues. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the stove for roasting. But the recipe says to roast, which is typically done in the oven. Hmm. The user is stuck because "roast" isn't working. So the next step is to close the oven, which might be the correct action. Let me try that.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe. The recipe requires slicing and roasting the banana, pork chop, and white tuna. So far, they've taken the banana, pork chop, and white tuna from the fridge and counter. They also took the knife and sliced the banana. Now, they need to roast the banana, but the system isn't recognizing "roast" as a verb. They tried putting the banana in the oven, but it's not working. The oven is closed, but they can't see the banana inside. Maybe the issue is that the banana is already in the oven, but the system isn't detecting it. Alternatively, maybe the correct action is to use the stove for roasting. The recipe says "roast," which is typically done in the oven, but perhaps the user needs to use the stove's function. Since the oven is closed, maybe they need to open it again. But the user tried that already. Alternatively, maybe the next step is to cook the pork chop and white tuna. The user has the pork chop and white tuna, so they need to slice them and roast them. But the system is stuck on the banana. Maybe the user needs to proceed with the other ingredients. Let's check the steps again. The recipe says slice and roast each ingredient. The user has sliced the banana. The pork chop and white tuna need to be sliced and roasted. But the user is stuck on the banana. Maybe the correct action is to slice the pork chop and white tuna. But the user can't carry all items. They have the banana and white tuna. Wait, they dropped the pork chop earlier. So maybe they need to pick it up again. But they can't carry it. This is confusing. The main issue is the banana not being recognized. Maybe the correct action is to use the stove instead of the oven. The stove is available. So the next step is to put the banana on the stove to roast it. That might work. Let's try that.

Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe. They've taken the banana, pork chop, and white tuna. They sliced the banana and tried to roast it, but the system isn't recognizing "roast" as a verb. They've tried putting the banana in the oven multiple times, but it's not working. The oven is closed, and they can't see the banana inside. Maybe the issue is that the banana is already in the oven, but the system isn't detecting it. Alternatively, maybe the correct action is to use the stove instead of the oven. But the user can't see the banana on the stove.

Maybe the next step is to check if the banana is in the oven and then proceed. But the system isn't recognizing the actions. The user is stuck in a loop of trying to put the banana in the oven, but it's not working. The main goal is to complete the recipe steps. Since the banana is the only one processed, maybe the user needs to move on to the next steps, like slicing the pork chop and white tuna. But they can't carry all items. They have the banana and white tuna. Maybe they need to drop the white tuna and take the pork chop again. But they can't carry both. This is confusing. The key is to follow the recipe steps despite the system's issues. The next action should be to slice the pork chop and white tuna, even if the system doesn't recognize the verbs. Maybe the correct command is to "slice pork chop" and "slice white tuna". Let's try that.
