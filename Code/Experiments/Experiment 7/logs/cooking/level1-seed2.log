You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You've entered a kitchen.

Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a fridge. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. The fridge contains a red onion, a raw red potato, a white onion, a green bell pepper and an orange bell pepper. You check the price tag on the fridge. 80 bucks? What a deal! You'll have to ask where they got this! You can make out a closed oven nearby. You see a table. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a cookbook and a knife. You scan the room, seeing a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The stove appears to be empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe in the cookbook. The recipe says to chop the red onion, fry it, and then prepare the meal. So the goal is to follow those steps.

First, they found the cookbook and looked at recipe #1. The ingredients needed are a red onion. The directions are to chop, fry, and prepare. 

The user tried to chop the red onion but got an error because they needed a knife. They tried using the knife on the onion, but the system didn't recognize the verb. Then they tried "use knife to chop red onion," which also didn't work. 

So the problem is that the system isn't recognizing the correct verb for chopping. The user needs to find the right way to chop the onion with the knife. Maybe the correct command is "chop the red onion with the knife" or "cut the red onion with the knife." Since "chop" requires the knife, they need to specify using the knife. 

The next step should be to use the knife to chop the red onion. The previous attempts didn't work because the verb wasn't recognized. So the correct action is to use the knife on the red onion, perhaps with the verb "cut" instead of "chop" if that's what the system accepts. Alternatively, maybe "chop" is correct but needs to be combined with the knife. 

Wait, the user tried "use knife on red onion" which didn't work. Maybe the correct command is "chop red onion with knife." But the system might expect a different phrasing. Since the user is stuck, they need to try a different synonym or structure. The next action should be to chop the red onion using the knife, perhaps using the correct verb that the system recognizes.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to cook a meal using the recipe from the cookbook. The recipe requires chopping the red onion, frying it, and preparing the meal. So far, the user has taken the red onion from the fridge, picked up the knife, but tried to chop the onion with the knife, which didn't work. The system said "That's not a verb I recognise," so maybe the correct action is to use the knife to cut the onion instead of chop.

Wait, the user tried "chop red onion with knife" and it didn't work. Maybe the correct verb is "cut" instead of "chop". Or perhaps the action should be "use knife to cut red onion". Since the system didn't recognize "chop", trying a different verb like "cut" might work. Also, the user needs to make sure they have both the onion and the knife. They already took the knife, so the next step is to cut the onion with the knife. Let's try that.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to cook a meal according to the recipe. The recipe requires chopping the red onion, frying it, and preparing the meal. So far, the user has taken the red onion from the fridge, picked up the knife, but keep getting errors when trying to chop or cut it.

The problem is that the system isn't recognizing the verbs "chop" or "cut" when using the knife. The user tried "use knife on red onion" which didn't work. Maybe the correct action is to "cut" the onion with the knife, but the system is expecting a different command. Alternatively, maybe the verb is "slice" instead of "cut" or "chop". Since the user is stuck in a loop of trying the same actions, they need to try a different synonym or structure. The next step should be to use the knife to cut the onion, perhaps using a different phrasing like "cut the red onion with the knife" or "use the knife to cut the red onion".

FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe. The recipe says to chop the red onion, fry it, and prepare the meal. So far, the user has taken the red onion from the fridge, picked up the knife, but keep getting errors when trying to chop or cut it.

The problem is that the system isn't recognizing the verbs "chop" or "cut" when using the knife. The user tried "use knife on red onion" which didn't work. Maybe the correct action is to "cut" the onion with the knife, but the system is expecting a different command. Alternatively, maybe the verb is "slice" instead of "cut" or "chop". Since the user is stuck in a loop of trying the same actions, they need to try a different synonym or structure. The next step should be to use the knife to cut the onion, perhaps using a different phrasing like "cut the red onion with the knife" or "use the knife to cut the red onion".
