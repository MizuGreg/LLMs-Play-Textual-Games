You've entered a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

You see a fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop and a lettuce! You can make out a closed conventional looking oven close by. You can see a table. You see a knife on the table. You can see a counter. On the counter you can see a cookbook. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe in the cookbook. The recipe says to dice the pork chop, roast it, and prepare the meal. So far, the user has tried to cut the pork chop with the knife but keep getting a response that only the cutting part is understood. Maybe the system isn't recognizing the action correctly.

Looking at the steps: the user has the pork chop and the knife. The first step was to open the cookbook, then look at it, then dice the pork chop. But the system keeps saying it only understood up to cutting. Maybe the correct action is to actually perform the cutting properly. The user tried "cut pork chop with knife" multiple times, but the system isn't processing it. Maybe the action needs to be phrased differently, like "cut the pork chop with the knife" instead of just "cut pork chop with knife". Alternatively, maybe after cutting, the next step is to roast it in the oven. But the oven is closed, so the user needs to open it first. Wait, the recipe says to roast the pork chop after dicing. So after cutting, the next step would be to roast it. But the oven is closed, so the user needs to open it. But the user hasn't done that yet. Maybe the loop is that the user is stuck on cutting, not moving to roasting. So the next action should be to open the oven, then roast the pork chop. But the user hasn't opened the oven yet. So the correct sequence is: cut the pork chop, open the oven, roast it, then prepare the meal. But the system is not recognizing the cutting action, so maybe the user needs to use a different command, like "use knife to cut pork chop" or "cut the pork chop with the knife". Alternatively, maybe the system requires the user to first take the knife, which they did, then cut it. But the response is not progressing. So the next step after cutting is to roast it, but the oven is closed. So the user needs to open the oven first. Wait, the initial description says the oven is closed. So the user needs to open it, then put the pork chop in, then roast it. But the recipe says to roast after dicing. So the correct steps are: cut the pork Chop, open the oven, roast it. But the user is stuck on cutting. So the next action should be to open the oven, then roast. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the answer should be to open the oven.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe. The recipe says to dice the pork chop, roast it, and prepare the meal. So far, the user has the pork chop and the knife. They tried cutting the pork chop but kept getting errors. Then they opened the oven but couldn't roast the pork chop because the command wasn't recognized.

First, the goal is to follow the recipe steps: dice, roast, prepare. The user has already diced the pork chop (though the system didn't acknowledge it), opened the oven. Now, the next step should be to roast the pork chop. But the system isn't recognizing "roast" as a verb. Maybe the correct command is "put pork chop in oven" or "place pork chop in oven". Alternatively, "roast pork chop" might need to be phrased differently. Since "roast" isn't working, maybe the user needs to use a synonym like "bake" or "sear". But the recipe says "roast", so maybe the system expects a specific command. The user tried "roast pork chop in oven" multiple times, but it's not working. So the next step is to find an alternative way to roast it, perhaps by using a different verb or command structure. The correct action would be to put the pork chop in the oven and then roast it. But since "roast" isn't recognized, maybe "bake" is the correct verb here. So the next action should be to bake the pork chop in the oven.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe. The recipe requires dicing the pork chop, roasting it, and preparing the meal. So far, the user has managed to take the pork chop from the fridge, put it in the oven, but is having trouble with the roasting step.

The previous attempts to use "roast" or "bake" as verbs aren't working. The system might be expecting a different command structure. Maybe the correct action is to "cook" the pork chop in the oven instead of "roast". Alternatively, since the oven is already open, the next step is to "cook" the pork chop. The user has already put the pork chop in the oven, so the next logical step is to start cooking it. The system might not recognize "roast" as a verb, so using "cook" could be the solution. Let's try that.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe. The recipe steps are: dice the pork chop, roast it, and prepare the meal. So far, the user has managed to take the pork chop, put it in the oven, and roast it. Now, the next step is to prepare the meal. But the user is having trouble with the exact command.

The user tried several commands like "prepare meal with pork chop", "serve meal with pork chop", but the system isn't recognizing them. The problem might be that the system expects a different phrasing. Maybe "prepare the meal" is the correct verb here. Alternatively, since the pork chop is already roasted, the next step is to serve it. But the system isn't accepting "serve" as a verb. Maybe the correct action is to "eat the pork chop" or "consume the meal". But the game's goal is to prepare the meal, not necessarily eat it. Wait, the initial instruction says "enjoy your meal", so maybe the final step is to "eat" it. However, the user might need to use the correct command structure. Since "serve" isn't working, perhaps "eat the pork chop" is the right command. Let me check the previous steps. The user roasted the pork chop, so now they need to eat it. The system might accept "eat" as the verb. So the next action should be to eat the pork chop.
