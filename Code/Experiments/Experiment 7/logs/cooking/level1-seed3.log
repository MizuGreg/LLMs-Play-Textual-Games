You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You've entered a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

You see a fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop and a lettuce! You can make out a closed conventional looking oven close by. You can see a table. You see a knife on the table. You can see a counter. On the counter you can see a cookbook. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

It isn't something you can open.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal in the kitchen. The goal is to find the recipe in the cookbook, use the ingredients from the fridge, and then cook the pork chop. 

First, the user tried to open the cookbook but couldn't. So the first step is to figure out how to open it. Maybe the cookbook is closed, so they need to open it. But the user tried that and it didn't work. Wait, maybe the cookbook is on the counter, so they need to pick it up first. Oh, right, the user saw the cookbook on the counter. So maybe the next step is to pick up the cookbook.

Wait, the initial description says the user can see a cookbook on the counter. The user tried to open it, but it wasn't possible. Maybe the cookbook is closed, so they need to open it. But the user tried to open it and it didn't work. Maybe the cookbook is not in a place where it can be opened. Or maybe the user needs to pick it up first. Let me check the initial description again.

The user sees a cookbook on the counter. The user tried to open it, but it wasn't possible. So maybe the cookbook is closed, and the user needs to open it. But the user tried to open it and it didn't work. Maybe the correct action is to pick up the cookbook first, then open it. But the user tried to open it directly. So maybe the next step is to pick up the cookbook.

Wait, the user's previous action was "open cookbook", which didn't work. So the next step should be to pick up the cookbook first. Then, once it's in hand, open it. So the next action should be "take cookbook" or "pick up cookbook". Then, after that, open it. But the user is stuck because they tried to open it without picking it up. So the correct next step is to take the cookbook first.
