You've just shown up in a livingroom.

You can make out a sofa. The sofa is comfy. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

There is an exit to the north. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You can make out an opened fridge, which looks conventional, nearby. The fridge contains a raw white tuna, a white onion, a raw pork chop and a yellow onion! You see an oven. You see a table. You wonder idly who left that here. The table is massive. But the thing is empty. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. There's something about an object in a room that's just so... TextWorld. You see a red hot pepper, a raw red tuna, a red bell pepper, a green hot pepper, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is an open frosted-glass door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe in the cookbook. The recipe requires slicing the red hot pepper and frying it. The user has the knife now, so they should be able to slice the pepper.

Wait, the user tried to slice the red hot pepper again, but the system said cutting requires a knife. But they just took the knife from the counter. Maybe they need to use the knife on the pepper. Maybe the action is "slice the red hot pepper with the knife"? But the previous attempt didn't work. Maybe the correct action is just "slice the red hot pepper" since the knife is already taken. Or maybe they need to use the knife first. Wait, the user has the knife, so perhaps the next step is to actually slice the pepper with the knife. But the system might not accept that syntax. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the knife on the pepper. Let me check the previous steps.

The user took the knife, then tried to slice the pepper again. The system said cutting requires a knife, but the user already has the knife. Maybe the correct action is to use the knife on the pepper. So the next step is to slice the red hot pepper using the knife. But the system might require the action to be "slice the red hot pepper" again. Maybe the user is in a loop because they tried slicing without the knife, then took the knife but didn't use it. So the next action should be to slice the pepper again, but this time with the knife. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the knife first. But the system might not accept that. So the next action is to slice the red hot pepper again, even though they have the knife. Maybe the system is expecting that action.

<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The user is trying to follow a recipe to cook a meal. The recipe has four steps: slice the red hot pepper, fry it, slice the white tuna, and roast the white tuna. So far, the user has managed to slice the red hot pepper. Now they need to fry it.

The problem is that the user is trying to use "fry the red hot pepper with the stove" or "fry the red hot pepper on the stove," but the system isn't recognizing those as valid commands. The error messages suggest that "fry" isn't a recognized verb here. Maybe the correct action is to use the stove's functionality. Since the stove is mentioned as being there, perhaps the user needs to "put the red hot pepper on the stove" or "heat the stove" before frying. Alternatively, maybe the correct command is simply "fry the red hot pepper," but the system is expecting a different phrasing.

Looking at the previous steps, after slicing the pepper, the user tried "fry the red hot pepper" but got an error. Then they tried various combinations with "with the stove" or "on the stove," which also didn't work. The system might be expecting a different verb or a different structure. Maybe the correct action is "cook the red hot pepper on the stove" or "heat the red hot pepper on the stove." Alternatively, since the recipe says "fry," maybe the user needs to use the word "fry" in a different context, like "fry the red hot pepper using the stove."

But the user has to avoid repeating the same action. Since "fry" isn't working, maybe the synonym is "cook" or "heat." However, the recipe specifically says "fry," so maybe the correct command is "fry the red hot pepper" without any additional words. But the system is rejecting it. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the stove first. So the next step would be to "put the red hot pepper on the stove" or "place the red hot pepper on the stove" to prepare it for frying. That might be the correct action here.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a recipe to cook a meal. The recipe has four steps: slice the red hot pepper, fry it, slice the white tuna, and roast the white tuna. So far, the user has managed to slice the red hot pepper. Now they need to fry it.

The problem is that the user is trying to use "fry the red hot pepper with the stove" or "fry the red hot pepper on the stove," but the system isn't recognizing those as valid commands. The error messages suggest that "fry" isn't a recognized verb here. Maybe the correct action is to use the stove's functionality. Since the stove is mentioned as being there, perhaps the user needs to "put the red hot pepper on the stove" or "heat the stove" before frying. Alternatively, maybe the correct command is simply "fry the red hot pepper," but the system is expecting a different phrasing.

Looking at the previous steps, after slicing the pepper, the user tried "fry the red hot pepper" but got an error. Then they tried various combinations with "with the stove" or "on the stove," which also didn't work. The system might be expecting a different verb or a different structure. Maybe the correct action is "cook the red hot pepper on the stove" or "heat the red hot pepper on the stove." Alternatively, since the recipe says "fry," maybe the user needs to use the word "fry" in a different context, like "fry the red hot pepper using the stove."

But the user has to avoid repeating the same action. Since "fry" isn't working, maybe the synonym is "cook" or "heat." However, the recipe specifically says "fry," so maybe the correct command is "fry the red hot pepper" without any additional words. But the system is rejecting it. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the stove first. So the next step would be to "put the red hot pepper on the stove" to prepare it for frying. That might be the correct action here.

Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe. The recipe says to slice the red hot pepper, fry it, slice the white tuna, and roast the white tuna. So far, the user has sliced the red hot pepper. Now they need to fry it.

But every time they try to use "fry the red hot pepper on the stove," the system says that's not a recognized verb. Maybe the correct action is different. Let's think about possible synonyms or alternative phrasings. Maybe "cook" instead of "fry"? Or "heat" the pepper on the stove? Alternatively, perhaps the user needs to use the stove's function, like "put the red hot pepper on the stove" and then "heat it." But the system is strict with verbs. Maybe the correct verb is "fry," but the system is expecting a different structure. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "use the stove to fry the red hot pepper." But the system might not recognize that. Since the user is stuck, maybe they need to try a different approach, like using "cook" instead of "fry." But the recipe specifically says "fry," so that might not work. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "place the red hot pepper on the stove" and then "fry it." But the system is rejecting "fry." Maybe the correct action is "fry the red hot pepper" without any additional words, even though the system says it's not recognized. But the user has to follow the system's rules. So the next step is to try a different verb or structure, like "cook the red hot pepper on the stove." But the system might not accept that. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "heat the red hot pepper on the stove." But the recipe says "fry," so that's not right. Hmm, this is tricky. The user is in a loop trying to fry the pepper, but the system doesn't recognize the command. The next step is to try a different action, maybe "cook" instead of "fry," even though the recipe says "fry." But that might not work. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "use the stove to fry the red hot pepper." But the system might not recognize that. The key is to find a command that the system accepts. Since "fry" is not working, maybe the correct action is "cook the red hot pepper on the stove." Let's try that.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe. They've already sliced the red hot pepper and fried it. Now they need to slice the white tuna. But they can't find the knife. The knife is on the counter, but the system says they can't see it. Maybe the user needs to look at the counter again or check the fridge. Wait, the recipe says to use a knife, so maybe the user needs to take the knife from the counter. But the system is saying they can't see it. Maybe the correct action is to "look at the counter" to find the knife. Alternatively, maybe the knife is already in hand, but the user forgot. Or perhaps the user needs to use a different verb, like "get the knife" instead of "take". Since the previous attempts to take the knife failed, maybe the correct action is to "get the knife from the counter" or "pick up the knife". But the system might not recognize those. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "use the knife" even if it's not taken. But the recipe requires the knife. So the next step is to find the knife, perhaps by looking at the counter again.
