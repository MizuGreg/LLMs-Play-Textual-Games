THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through a series of rooms: bathroom, corridor, bedroom, and back and forth between them. The goal is to find the cookbook in the kitchen to cook a meal.

First, I need to recall the initial instructions. The user started in the bathroom, then moved west to the corridor, then east to the bedroom, and kept looping between corridor and bedroom. The problem is that the user is stuck in a loop between the corridor and bedroom, not progressing towards the kitchen or the cookbook.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the bedroom again, and the prompt suggests going east or west. But going east leads back to the corridor, and west leads back to the bedroom. So, the user is stuck in a loop between these two rooms. The next step should be to find a different path or a way out of this loop.

The key is to break the loop. Since the previous actions (go west and east) are leading back to the same places, maybe there's another direction. But according to the descriptions, the corridor has an exit to the north, which is mentioned as "no door." The bedroom has an exit to the north as well. Wait, in the corridor description, there's an exit to the north. Maybe the user needs to go north from the corridor instead of west or east.

But in the previous steps, the user kept going west and east, missing the north exit. So the next action should be to go north from the corridor. However, the user is currently in the bedroom. So perhaps the user needs to go north from the bedroom. Wait, the bedroom's description says there's an exit to the north. So maybe the user should try going north from the bedroom instead of east or west.

But the user has been going back and forth between corridor and bedroom. The loop is because the user is not taking the north exit. So the correct next step is to go north from the current room, which is the bedroom. That would lead to the north exit, possibly leading to the kitchen where the cookbook is located.

Therefore, the next action should be to go north from the bedroom. That's the key to breaking the loop and progressing towards the kitchen.

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. A standard one. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

Hey, want to see a fridge? Look over there, a fridge. You look around you, at all the containers and supporters, doors and objects, and you think to yourself. Why? Why Textworld? You can see a closed oven in the corner. Were you looking for a table? Because look over there, it's a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a knife. You make out a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? You see a yellow apple, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a green apple, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a yellow onion, a raw purple potato, a tomato and a cookbook on the counter. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm. Oh well

There is a closed frosted-glass door leading east. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to cook a meal, which requires finding the cookbook in the kitchen. They started in the bathroom, then moved back and forth between the corridor and bedroom, missing the north exit from the corridor.

First, the goal is to reach the kitchen, find the cookbook, and cook. The user has already taken the cookbook from the kitchen but got stuck in a loop between the corridor and bedroom. The next step should be to escape the loop by going north from the corridor instead of west/east. But since they're in the bedroom, they need to go north from there. Wait, the bedroom has an exit to the north. So the correct action is to go north from the bedroom to exit the loop and reach the kitchen again. But the user kept going east and west, so changing direction to north is essential. The previous actions were repetitive, so using a synonym like "north" instead of "exit" would help. The next command should be "go north" from the bedroom.

SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user's goal is to cook a meal, which requires finding the cookbook in the kitchen. They've already taken the cookbook from the kitchen but keep getting stuck in a loop between the corridor and bedroom.

First, the goal is to reach the kitchen, find the cookbook, and cook. The user has already taken the cookbook, so the next step is to use it. But they keep looping between rooms, so the problem is the loop.

Previous actions involved going back and forth between corridor and bedroom. The next step should be to escape the loop by going north from the corridor instead of west/east. But since they're in the bedroom, going north from there would lead to the living room, then back to the kitchen. However, the user might not have tried that yet. The key is to break the loop by changing direction. The correct action is to go north from the bedroom to exit the loop and reach the kitchen again.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal using the cookbook they found in the kitchen. But every time they try to use the cookbook, it doesn't work. The game is stuck in a loop where they can't proceed beyond the kitchen.

First, the goal is to cook a meal. They have the cookbook, so the next step should be to use it. But the commands like "use cookbook" or "cook meal with cookbook" aren't working. Maybe the correct action is to look for ingredients in the kitchen. The user has been stuck in the kitchen, so they need to find the right ingredients to cook.

Previous actions involved trying to cook but failing. The loop is because they're not using the ingredients properly. The next step is to check the counter for ingredients and use them with the cookbook. The correct command might be to take an ingredient, then use the cookbook with it. But since they can't see any such thing, maybe they need to interact with the stove or oven. Alternatively, maybe the cookbook is already in hand, so the next step is to cook using the available ingredients.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to cook a meal, which requires using the cookbook and ingredients. They've already taken the cookbook and some apples but can't carry more items.

First, the goal is to cook a meal. They need to use the cookbook and ingredients. But they're stuck because they can't carry more items. The previous actions involved taking multiple items, which is causing the problem.

Second, the user has taken the cookbook and some apples, but the game is preventing them from taking more due to the carry limit. The next step should be to use the ingredients they have with the cookbook.

Third, the loop is because they're trying to take too many items. The solution is to use the existing items without taking more. So, the correct action is to cook using the cookbook and the apples they have.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal using the cookbook and some ingredients. They've taken the cookbook and a yellow apple, but the game isn't recognizing the cooking command. The previous attempts to use the cookbook with the apple aren't working.

First, the goal is to cook a meal. They need to use the cookbook and ingredients. But the game is stuck because the commands aren't working. Maybe the correct action is to use the cookbook and the apple in a different way.

Second, the user has the cookbook and the apple. The next step should be to cook using those. But the game isn't allowing it. Perhaps the correct command is to "cook" without specifying, or use a different verb.

Third, the loop is because the user is repeatedly trying the same command. The solution is to find another way to use the ingredients. Maybe the stove is the right place to cook. So the next action is to use the stove with the apple and cookbook.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out how to win this game. The user's goal is to cook a meal, which requires using the cookbook and ingredients. They've already taken the cookbook and some apples, but they can't carry more items. The problem is that the game isn't recognizing the cooking commands.

First, the goal is to cook a meal. The user has the cookbook and some ingredients, so the next step is to use them. But the commands like "cook with apple and cookbook" aren't working. Maybe the correct action is to use the stove or oven, which is mentioned in the kitchen description.

Second, the user has tried multiple commands without success. The loop is because they're repeating the same actions. The solution is to find a different way to use the ingredients. Maybe the stove is the right place to cook, so the next step is to use the stove with the apple and cookbook.

Third, the game is stuck in a loop of trying to cook without progress. The correct action is to use the stove, which is a conventional item in the kitchen. So the next command should be to use the stove with the apple and cookbook.
