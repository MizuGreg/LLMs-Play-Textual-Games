You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You've entered a kitchen.

You make out an opened conventional looking fridge in the corner. The fridge contains a yellow onion, a yellow apple, a red onion, a raw pork chop, a white onion and an orange bell pepper. You make out an oven. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. Look over there! a table. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a raw yellow potato, a green hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Silly stove, silly, empty, good for nothing stove.

Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is in a kitchen, and the goal is to cook a meal using the ingredients found there. The first step was to open the cookbook, but it wasn't possible. Then they looked around, under the counter, table, and stove, but nothing was found. Now, the user is stuck in a loop of checking places without finding the cookbook.

Wait, the cookbook is on the counter. The user looked under the counter and table, but maybe they didn't check the counter properly. The initial description said the counter has a cookbook and a knife. So maybe the user needs to pick up the cookbook from the counter. But the previous action was looking under the counter, which didn't find anything. So maybe the next step is to check the counter again, but the user already saw the cookbook there. Hmm, but the user didn't take it. So perhaps the next action is to take the cookbook from the counter. But the user hasn't done that yet. The problem is that the user is looking in the wrong places. The cookbook is on the counter, so the correct action is to take it. But the user might have missed it. So the next step is to take the cookbook from the counter. That would allow them to proceed with the recipe.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is trying to cook a meal using the ingredients from the kitchen. The goal is to follow the recipe in the cookbook. So far, they took the cookbook and started with slicing the yellow onion. But the system responded that cutting requires a knife. The user has the knife on the counter, so they need to pick it up first.

First step: The goal is to cook the meal by gathering ingredients and following the directions. They've taken the cookbook and started slicing the onion, but need the knife. 

Second step: Past actions include taking the cookbook, looking around, and slicing the onion. The next step should be picking up the knife from the counter.

Third step: The user tried slicing without the knife, which is why they need to get the knife first. Repeating the same action (slicing without the knife) isn't working, so the synonym here is "take the knife" instead of "get the knife."

Final action: Take the knife from the counter to proceed with slicing the onion.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe in the cookbook. The current step is cutting the yellow onion with the knife. But every time they try to say "cut the yellow onion with the knife," the system only understands up to "cut the yellow onion." So maybe the issue is that the command is too verbose or the system isn't recognizing the knife part.

First, the goal is to follow the recipe: slice the onion, roast it, dice the potato, roast the potato, then prepare the meal. So far, they've taken the cookbook, got the knife, but haven't actually cut the onion yet. The problem is that the system isn't processing the "with the knife" part. Maybe the correct command is just "slice the yellow onion" since the knife is already taken. Alternatively, maybe "cut the yellow onion" without mentioning the knife, as the knife is in hand.

Second, past actions: took cookbook, took knife. Next step is to cut the onion. But the system isn't accepting the command with the knife. So perhaps the next action should be "slice the yellow onion" instead of "cut," or "cut the yellow onion" without specifying the knife. But the user already has the knife, so maybe the system needs a different phrasing.

Third, the user is in a loop because every time they try to cut, the system doesn't recognize the action. The solution is to use a synonym or simplify the command. Instead of "cut the yellow onion with the knife," just say "cut the yellow onion" since the knife is already taken. That way, the system processes the action without the extra detail.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe. The current step is slicing the yellow onion. They took the onion and the knife, but the system is prompting them to specify how to cut it. The previous attempt to slice with the knife didn't work because they didn't take the onion first. Now they've taken the onion, so the next step is to slice it.

First, the goal is to follow the recipe: slice the onion, roast it, dice the potato, roast the potato, then prepare the meal. So far, they've taken the cookbook, the knife, the yellow onion. Next is slicing the onion.

Second, past actions: took cookbook, took knife, took onion. Next step is to slice the onion. But the system says they need to specify how to cut it. Maybe the correct command is "slice the yellow onion" without mentioning the knife since they already have it.

Third, the user might be looping between taking the onion and trying to cut it. The key is to properly slice the onion now that it's in hand. The previous error was not taking the onion first, but now it's taken. So the next action should be slicing it.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe. The current step is after slicing the yellow onion. The next step in the recipe is to roast the yellow onion. But the system says "That's not a verb I recognise." So maybe "roast" isn't the right command here. The user might need to use a different verb or action.

First, the goal is to follow the recipe: slice the onion, roast it, dice the potato, roast the potato, then prepare the meal. So far, they've sliced the onion. Next is roasting it. But the system doesn't recognize "roast" as a verb. Maybe the correct action is "put the onion in the oven" or "heat the onion." Alternatively, maybe "roast the yellow onion" is the correct command, but the system is having trouble with it. 

Second, past actions: took cookbook, took knife, took onion, sliced onion. Next step is to roast it. But since "roast" isn't working, perhaps the user needs to use a synonym like "bake" or "heat." Alternatively, maybe the oven needs to be used. The user saw an oven in the kitchen. So maybe the next step is to put the onion in the oven.

Third, the user is in a loop because they can't get the oven to work. The key is to use the oven. So instead of trying to roast directly, they should put the onion in the oven.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe. The current step is after roasting the yellow potato by putting it in the oven. The next step in the recipe is to "prepare the meal," but the user hasn't done that yet.

First, the goal is to follow the recipe's directions: slice the onion, roast it, dice the potato, roast the potato, then prepare the meal. So far, they've done the first four steps. The next step is to prepare the meal. But the system isn't recognizing "roast" as a verb, so maybe "prepare" is the correct command here.

Second, past actions: took cookbook, knife, onion, sliced onion, put in oven, took potato, diced potato, put in oven. Next step is to prepare the meal. Since "roast" isn't working, the user should use "prepare" instead.

Third, the user might be looping between steps if they keep using "roast." The key is to use the correct command for the final step, which is "prepare the meal." So the next action should be preparing the meal.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe. The current step is after roasting the onion and potato. The next step is to "prepare the meal," but the system isn't recognizing the command. The user has already followed all the steps in the recipe: sliced the onion, roasted it, diced the potato, roasted that too. Now, the final step is to combine them into a meal.

First, the goal is to cook the meal by following the recipe's directions. The user has done all the preparation steps. The next step is to prepare the meal, which likely means combining the roasted ingredients.

Second, past actions: took cookbook, knife, onion, sliced onion, put in oven, took potato, diced potato, put in oven. Now, the meal is ready, so the next step is to prepare it.

Third, the user is stuck because the system isn't accepting "prepare the meal." Maybe the correct command is "serve the meal" or "eat the meal," but since the goal is to cook, perhaps "combine the ingredients" or "assemble the meal." But the recipe says "prepare meal," so maybe the system expects a different phrasing. The key is to use the correct command that the system recognizes, even if it's a synonym.

Maybe the correct command is "eat the meal," but that's not cooking. Wait, the game might expect a different action. Since the oven is already used for roasting, maybe the final step is to take the roasted items out of the oven and combine them. But the user hasn't done that yet. Alternatively, maybe the meal is considered prepared once the ingredients are in the oven. But the system is not recognizing any of the commands. The user is stuck in a loop of trying different verbs. The key is to find a command that the system accepts, even if it's a synonym. The answer might be "take the meal" or "get the meal," but I'm not sure. The user needs to break the loop by using a different action.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop where they can't get the meal from the oven. The goal is to cook the meal by following the recipe. They've already sliced and roasted the onion and potato. The next step should be to combine them into a meal. But the system isn't recognizing any of the commands. Maybe the correct action is to "serve the meal" even though it's not a verb. Alternatively, the game might expect a different phrasing. The user needs to break the loop by trying a different command, even if it's a synonym.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal, but the system isn't recognizing their commands. The goal is to follow the recipe steps: slice the onion, roast it, dice the potato, roast the potato, then prepare the meal. The user has done the first four steps. Now, the next step is to prepare the meal. But the system isn't accepting any of the commands like "prepare," "serve," "assemble," or "combine."

First, the goal is to cook the meal by following the recipe. The user has done all the preparation steps. The next step is to combine the roasted ingredients into a meal.

Second, past actions: took cookbook, knife, onion, sliced onion, put in oven, took potato, diced potato, put in oven. Now, the meal is ready, so the next step is to prepare it.

Third, the user is stuck in a loop because the system isn't recognizing any of the commands. The key is to use a different action, maybe "eat the meal" even though it's not cooking. Alternatively, the game might expect a different phrasing. The answer might be "eat the meal" even if it's not the correct step, but the user has to proceed.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.
