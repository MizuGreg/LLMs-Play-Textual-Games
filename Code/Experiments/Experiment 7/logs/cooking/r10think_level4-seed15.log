You've just sauntered into a kitchen.

You can make out a fridge. You shudder, but continue examining the room. The fridge contains a raw white tuna, a white onion, a raw red tuna and a raw pork chop. You see an oven. Oh, great. Here's a table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Silly table, silly, empty, good for nothing table. You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a cookbook and a knife. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open frosted-glass door leading west. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door.

THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal based on the cookbook in the kitchen. The goal is to find the recipe, gather ingredients, and prepare the meal.

First, they started in the living room, went west to the corridor, then east back to the living room, then north to the kitchen. In the kitchen, they took the cookbook from the counter and tried to open the west door, but it led to the pantry. Then they went back east to the kitchen again. Now they're stuck in a loop between the kitchen and pantry.

So the next step is to avoid the loop. Instead of opening the west door again, maybe they should check the kitchen for ingredients. The fridge has raw tuna, onion, pork chop. The cookbook is there. Maybe they need to use the ingredients from the fridge to cook. But the oven is mentioned. Wait, the user hasn't used the fridge yet. So maybe the next action is to check the fridge for ingredients, then use them in the oven. But the user is in the kitchen again. The previous action was trying to open the west door again, which didn't help. So instead of opening the door, maybe they should look inside the fridge. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next command should be to open the fridge to get the ingredients.

Okay, let's break this down. The user needs to cook a meal using the cookbook in the kitchen. They've already gathered all the ingredients: white tuna, onion, red tuna, and pork chop. The recipe from the cookbook says to chop the white tuna, roast it, and prepare the meal.

The user tried to chop the white tuna but was asked what they want to chop it with. The previous action was "chop white tuna," which didn't work because they didn't specify a tool. So, the next step is to use a knife, which is present on the counter. The user needs to use the knife to chop the tuna. Since the knife is in the kitchen, the correct action is to take the knife first, then use it to chop the tuna. But the user hasn't taken the knife yet. So the next command should be to take the knife from the counter.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal using the cookbook. They've gathered all the ingredients, chopped the white tuna, and now need to roast it. The problem is that the previous attempts to use the oven as a verb aren't working. The system is expecting a different command structure.

First, the goal is to follow the recipe: chop the tuna, roast it, and prepare the meal. The user has already chopped the tuna. Now, they need to roast it using the oven. The error messages indicate that "roast" isn't a valid verb here. Maybe the correct action is to use the oven's function. Since the oven is in the kitchen, perhaps the next step is to use the oven to roast the tuna. But the system isn't recognizing "roast" with "oven". Maybe the correct command is "put white tuna in oven" or "heat oven". Alternatively, since the user has the knife, maybe they need to use it to chop again, but that's already done. Wait, the recipe says "roast the white tuna", so the action should be to roast it. But the system isn't accepting "roast". Maybe the correct verb is "cook" or "bake". Alternatively, the user might need to interact with the oven first. Since the oven is present, maybe the next step is to use the oven to roast the tuna. But the system is not recognizing "roast". Perhaps the correct command is "roast white tuna in oven" but that's not working. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the oven's action. Since the user is stuck, the next step is to try a different command, like "put white tuna in oven" or "heat oven". But the user has to follow the recipe's directions. The recipe says "roast the white tuna", so the correct action is to roast it. But the system isn't accepting "roast". Maybe the correct verb is "cook" instead. So the next action should be "cook white tuna with oven". But the system might not recognize that. Alternatively, the user might need to use the oven's function. Since the user is in a loop, the next step is to try a different command, like "use oven to roast white tuna" but that's not working. The correct command might be "roast white tuna in oven" but the system isn't recognizing it. So the next step is to try a different approach, maybe "put white tuna in oven" to start the roasting process. That's the next logical step.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe. They've gathered all the ingredients, chopped the white tuna, and put it in the oven. Now they need to roast it. The problem is that the system isn't recognizing commands like "heat oven to 200°C". The user has to follow the recipe's directions, which say to roast the tuna.

Earlier attempts to use "heat" or "set" didn't work. Maybe the correct verb is "roast" without specifying the oven. But the recipe says to roast it in the oven. Wait, the user already put the tuna in the oven. Maybe the next step is to "roast white tuna" without mentioning the oven, assuming it's already in there. But the system might require specifying the oven. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the oven's function. Since the oven is open and the tuna is inside, perhaps the next step is to "roast white tuna in oven" but the system isn't accepting that. The user is stuck in a loop of trying to heat the oven. The correct action might be to just roast the tuna, assuming the oven is already preheated. But the recipe says to roast it, so the command should be "roast white tuna".

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe. They've gathered all the ingredients, chopped the white tuna, and put it in the oven. Now they need to roast it. The problem is that the system isn't recognizing commands like "roast white tuna in oven". The user has to follow the recipe's directions, which say to roast the tuna.

Earlier attempts to use "heat" or "set" didn't work. Maybe the correct verb is "roast" without specifying the oven. But the recipe says to roast it in the oven. Wait, the user already put the tuna in the oven. Maybe the next step is to "roast white tuna" assuming the oven is already preheated. But the system might require specifying the oven. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the oven's function. Since the oven is open and the tuna is inside, perhaps the next step is to "roast white tuna in oven" but the system isn't accepting that. The user is stuck in a loop of trying to heat the oven. The correct action might be to just roast the tuna, assuming the oven is already preheated. But the recipe says to roast it, so the command should be "roast white tuna".
