THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal based on the cookbook in the kitchen. The goal is to find the recipe, cook the meal, and enjoy it.

So far, they've navigated through the corridor, bathroom, and into the kitchen. In the kitchen, they found the cookbook, took it, and then went back south. Now they're back in the corridor again.

The problem is that they're stuck in a loop between the corridor and the kitchen. Every time they go north, they end up in the kitchen again, then go south back to the corridor. That's not making progress towards the goal.

The next step should be to find a way to cook using the ingredients in the kitchen. They have a cookbook, so maybe they need to check the ingredients listed in the recipe. But the cookbook isn't open yet. Wait, earlier when they tried to open it, it said it wasn't something you could open. But they took it. Maybe they need to open it again?

Alternatively, maybe they need to use the ingredients on the counter. The ingredients are a green apple, raw purple potato, green bell pepper, yellow apple, and raw red potato. The cookbook might have a recipe that uses these. But how to proceed?

Wait, the user is in the corridor again. The exits are north (to kitchen) and south. Maybe they need to go north again to the kitchen, open the cookbook, check the recipe, then use the ingredients to cook. But they already tried that. Maybe they need to look for a way to cook the meal without going back and forth.

Alternatively, maybe the stove is the key. The stove is conventional but has nothing on it. Maybe they need to put the ingredients on the stove and cook. But how to do that in the game?

The main issue is the loop. The user is repeatedly going between corridor and kitchen. To break the loop, they need to do something else in the kitchen. Maybe they need to open the cookbook again, even though it said it wasn't open. Or perhaps they need to use the ingredients from the counter.

Wait, the user took the cookbook from the table. Maybe they need to open it now. The previous attempt to open it failed, but maybe they can try again. Or maybe they need to look at the ingredients in the kitchen to find what's needed for the recipe.

So the next action should be to open the cookbook again. Even though it said it wasn't something you could open, maybe they can try again. Alternatively, check the ingredients on the counter to see what's needed for the recipe.

But the user is in the corridor again. So the next step is to go north to the kitchen again, then open the cookbook. But they already did that. Maybe the cookbook is now openable. Or maybe they need to use the ingredients from the counter.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is to use the stove and the ingredients to cook the meal. But how? The game might require using the cookbook's recipe to know which ingredients to use and how.

So the next action is to go north to the kitchen, open the cookbook, then check the recipe, then use the ingredients to cook. But since they are in the corridor again, the next step is to go north again.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to cook a meal using the cookbook in the kitchen. They've already navigated to the kitchen, taken the cookbook, but couldn't open it. Then they took a knife and tried to cut the purple potato, but the game isn't recognizing the action.

First step: The goal is to find a recipe in the cookbook, gather ingredients, and cook the meal. So far, they've taken the cookbook and knife, but couldn't open the book or cut the potato successfully.

Second step: They need to open the cookbook to get the recipe. Since the previous attempt failed, maybe they need to try a different command, like 'read cookbook' instead of 'open'. Also, the cutting action might not be the right way; perhaps they need to use the stove or oven once they have the ingredients.

Third step: They're stuck in a loop between the corridor and kitchen. To break it, they should focus on using the cookbook properly. Instead of cutting, maybe they need to use the ingredients on the stove. So the next action should be to open the cookbook again, using a different command if necessary.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe in the cookbook. The goal is to follow the recipe steps correctly.

So far, they've opened the cookbook and found the recipe. The ingredients needed are green apple, orange bell pepper, and purple potato. The directions say to dice the green apple, roast it, slice the bell pepper, roast it, dice the purple potato, fry it, then prepare the meal.

The user has the knife and the ingredients on the counter. They tried cutting the green apple but the game didn't recognize the action. The previous attempts to cut the apple with the knife were unsuccessful. The problem might be that the game expects a different command structure, like using "dice" instead of "cut" or "slice".

The next step should be to use the correct commands as per the recipe. Since "cut" isn't working, maybe "dice" is the right verb. Also, they need to roast the apple, so maybe using the oven. But the oven is closed. They might need to open it first. Alternatively, the stove could be used for roasting.

Wait, the recipe says "roast the green apple". The user has the knife, so maybe they need to dice the apple first, then put it in the oven. But the oven is closed. So the steps would be: dice the apple, open the oven, roast it. Then do the same for the bell pepper and potato.

But the user is stuck on cutting the apple. The game might require using the knife to dice it. So the correct command would be "dice green apple with knife". But previous attempts to cut didn't work. Maybe the game expects "dice" instead of "cut". So the next action should be to dice the green apple using the knife.

THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to roast the green apple using the oven. The game isn't recognizing "roast" as a verb here. Maybe the correct command is "put in oven" or "heat in oven". Since the previous attempts to use "roast" failed, I need to find another way to express putting the diced apple into the oven.

The user has already diced the green apple. Now, they need to place it in the oven to roast it. The oven is closed, so maybe they need to open it first. But the recipe says to roast it, so perhaps the action is to put it in the oven without opening. Alternatively, the game might expect a different verb like "place" or "put".

Since "roast" isn't working, the next step is to use "put in oven" or "place in oven". Let's try "put in oven" as the command.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to cook a meal using the recipe from the cookbook. They've followed the steps to dice the green apple, put it in the oven, but the game isn't recognizing "roast" as a verb. They keep getting stuck in a loop where they take and put the apple back into the oven.

First, the goal is to follow the recipe steps: dice the apple, roast it, slice the bell pepper, roast it, dice the potato, fry it, then prepare the meal. So far, they've diced the apple and put it in the oven. The next step should be to roast it, but the game doesn't accept "roast". Maybe the correct action is to "heat" or "bake" instead. Alternatively, maybe the oven is already doing the roasting once the apple is inside.

Since the user is stuck on the roast command, they need to find another way to proceed. The loop happens because they keep taking and putting the apple into the oven. The solution is to use a different verb for roasting, like "heat" or "bake", or perhaps the oven automatically roasts when the apple is inside. But the game requires a specific command. Since "roast" isn't working, maybe "heat" is the correct verb here. Alternatively, the user might need to use the stove instead of the oven for roasting. But the recipe specifies the oven. So the next action should be to use "heat" instead of "roast".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook the meal according to the recipe. They've followed the steps to dice the green apple and put it in the oven. The problem is that the game isn't recognizing "roast" or "heat" as valid verbs for the oven. They keep getting stuck in a loop where they have to put the apple back into the oven.

First, the goal is to follow the recipe: dice the apple, roast it, slice the bell pepper, roast it, dice the potato, fry it, then prepare the meal. So far, they've done the apple part. Now, they need to move on to the bell pepper and potato.

But the user is stuck on the oven action. The game might expect a different command, like "cook" or " bake". Since "roast" and "heat" aren't working, maybe "cook" is the correct verb. Alternatively, maybe the oven is already doing the job once the apple is inside, so they just need to proceed to the next step.

The next step after roasting the apple would be to slice the bell pepper. But the user is stuck on the oven command. So the solution is to use a different verb for roasting, like "cook", and then proceed to the next ingredient.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to slice the orange bell pepper, but the game says they can't see it. Wait, earlier in the kitchen, the user saw a green bell pepper and a raw purple potato. Maybe the orange bell pepper is a typo or misunderstanding. The recipe says "orange bell pepper", but maybe it's actually the green one. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to take the bell pepper first.

The user has the knife and is in the kitchen. The previous step was cooking the green apple. Now, they need to slice the orange bell pepper. But the game isn't recognizing it. Maybe the correct name is "green bell pepper" instead of "orange". Or perhaps the user needs to take the bell pepper from the counter first. Since the game says "can't see any such thing", maybe the user hasn't taken the bell pepper yet. So the next step is to take the green bell pepper and then slice it.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, the user is trying to roast the green bell pepper but the game isn't recognizing "roast" as a verb. They've already roasted the green apple by using "cook" with the oven. Maybe the correct verb here is "heat" or "bake". Since "roast" isn't working, they should try "heat" instead. The next step is to use "heat" to roast the bell pepper in the oven.

But the user is in a loop because they keep getting stuck on the same command. The key is to use a different verb that the game accepts. Since "cook" worked for the apple, maybe "heat" is the right choice here. So the next action should be to heat the green bell pepper in the oven.
