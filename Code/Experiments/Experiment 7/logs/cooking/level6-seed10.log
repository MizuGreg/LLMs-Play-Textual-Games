You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Livingroom =-
You are in a livingroom. An ordinary kind of place. The room is well lit.

You make out a sofa. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Hm. Oh well

There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door.

-= Bedroom =-
You find yourself in a bedroom. A typical kind of place.

You can make out a bed. The bed is large. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the bed.

There is an exit to the north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one. There is an exit to the north. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. A normal one.

You can see a fridge. You shudder, but continue examining the room. The fridge contains a green bell pepper, a yellow onion, a lettuce, an orange bell pepper, a carrot, a raw white tuna, a block of cheese, a green apple, a green hot pepper, a yellow apple and a red onion. You can see a closed oven right there by you. You can make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you can make out a raw yellow potato, a red hot pepper, a tomato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a red apple and a cookbook. Were you looking for a stove? Because look over there, it's a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is an open frosted-glass door leading east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text-based game where they need to cook a meal using the cookbook found in the kitchen. The goal is to follow the recipe steps to prepare a dish.

First, the user has already navigated through the living room, bedroom, corridor, and arrived in the kitchen. They found the cookbook on the counter and took it. Now, they need to use the cookbook to find a recipe.

The next step is to check the cookbook's contents to find a recipe. Since the user tried to open it but it wasn't possible, they took it. Now, they need to look through the cookbook's pages to find a recipe. Maybe they need to open it again or look for a specific entry.

Wait, the user tried to open the cookbook but it wasn't possible. But they took it. Maybe the cookbook is now in their inventory, so they can read it. The next action should be to read the cookbook to find a recipe. Once they have the recipe, they can gather the necessary ingredients from the kitchen's fridge and pantry. Then, they can use the stove to cook the meal. The final step is to enjoy the meal once it's cooked.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe in the cookbook. The recipe requires dicing the green bell pepper, frying it, then doing the same with the yellow onion and potato. So far, they've diced the green bell pepper. Now, the next step is to fry it. But the user is having trouble using the right verbs.

The user tried "fry green bell pepper with stove" but the system didn't recognize it. Maybe "fry" isn't the right verb here. Perhaps they need to use "cook" instead? Or maybe "heat" the pan first. Wait, the recipe says "fry the green bell pepper," so maybe the correct action is to use the stove's cooking function. Alternatively, maybe they need to use the word "cook" instead of "fry." Let me check the previous steps. The user had to use "dice" for cutting, so maybe "fry" is correct, but the system is expecting a different phrasing. Maybe "fry green bell pepper on stove" or "fry green bell pepper in pan." But the user tried "in pan" and it didn't work. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the correct action is to "cook the green bell pepper" using the stove. Since the stove is the cooking appliance here. So the next step is to cook the diced green bell pepper using the stove. Let me try that.
