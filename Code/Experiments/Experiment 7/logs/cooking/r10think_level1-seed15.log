You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. An usual one.

You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to a fridge. Hmmm... what else, what else? The fridge contains a raw white tuna, a white onion, a raw red tuna, a yellow onion and a block of cheese. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You make out an oven! You scan the room, seeing a table. The table is massive. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh, great. Here's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a raw yellow potato, a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal based on the cookbook in the kitchen. The goal is to find the recipe, gather ingredients, and cook something.

First, the user checked the fridge, counter, table, and stove but didn't find the cookbook. Wait, the initial description mentioned a cookbook on the counter. But when they looked around, they didn't see it. Maybe they need to check the counter again or look under the counter. But the user already looked under the counter and found nothing. Hmm.

Wait, the user tried opening the cookbook but it wasn't possible. Maybe the cookbook is in a different place. The stove, table, or maybe the fridge? But the fridge was checked. Maybe the cookbook is on the counter but not visible? Or maybe the user needs to take an item from the counter, like the knife, to help. But the main issue is finding the cookbook.

Wait, the initial description said the counter has a cookbook. The user looked around but didn't see it. Maybe they need to look more carefully. Alternatively, maybe the cookbook is in the fridge, but the fridge items were listed. Wait, the user already checked the fridge and found the ingredients but not the cookbook. So the cookbook must be on the counter. Maybe the user needs to pick it up. But the previous action was looking around, which didn't find it. Maybe the next step is to take the cookbook from the counter. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action should be to take the cookbook.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is trying to cook a meal using the cookbook. The goal is to follow the recipe, which requires chopping the white tuna, roasting it, and preparing the meal.

So far, the user took the cookbook, read the recipe, and tried to chop the white tuna. They have the knife now. The problem is that the previous attempt to "chop white tuna" failed because they needed to use the knife. The error message said "That's not a verb I recognise," which probably means the command was incorrect.

Looking at the steps: The recipe says to "chop the white tuna," which requires using the knife. The user has the knife, so the next step should be to use the knife on the tuna. But the previous attempt to "use knife on white tuna" didn't work. Maybe the correct command is "chop white tuna with knife" or "cut white tuna with knife." Alternatively, maybe "cut the white tuna" is the correct verb.

The user is stuck in a loop because they keep trying to chop but can't. The key is to use the correct verb and mention the knife. Since "chop" requires the knife, the command should include using the knife. So the next action should be "chop white tuna with knife" or similar. But the system might expect a different phrasing. Maybe "cut white tuna" is the correct verb without specifying the knife, but since the knife is needed, it's necessary to include it. Alternatively, the user might need to "use knife on white tuna" again, but that failed before. Wait, the previous attempt was "use knife on white tuna" which was invalid. So maybe the correct command is "chop white tuna" again, assuming the knife is already in hand. But the system said "Cutting something requires a knife," implying that the knife isn't being used. So the user needs to explicitly use the knife. Maybe the correct command is "cut white tuna with knife" or "chop white tuna with knife." Since the system didn't accept "use knife on white tuna," perhaps the correct syntax is "chop white tuna with knife." Let's try that.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe. The recipe says to chop the white tuna, roast it, and prepare the meal. So far, they've chopped the tuna and put it in the oven. Now they need to roast it.

But the user is getting errors when trying to roast the tuna. The previous attempts to use "roast", "roast with oven", and "use oven on white tuna" didn't work. The system says "That's not a verb I recognise." So maybe the correct verb is "put in oven" or "place in oven". But they already put it in the oven. Wait, maybe the next step is to "cook" the tuna in the oven. Alternatively, maybe the oven needs to be turned on. But the user already opened the oven and put the tuna in. Maybe the next step is to "close the oven" to start roasting. Or perhaps "roast" is the correct verb, but the user needs to specify the oven. Let me check the previous steps.

The user put the white tuna in the oven. Now, maybe the correct action is to "roast white tuna" again, but the system says it's not a verb. Alternatively, maybe the oven is already on, so the user just needs to wait. But the game might require an action. Alternatively, the user might need to "use the oven to roast the tuna". But the system doesn't recognize that. Maybe the correct command is "roast" without specifying the oven, but that didn't work before. Hmm. The user is stuck in a loop where they can't proceed. The key is to find the right verb that the system accepts. Since "roast" failed, maybe the correct action is "cook" or "heat". But the recipe says "roast". Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "close the oven" to start the roasting process. Let's try that.
