You've just walked into a kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You can see a fridge. Now that's what I call TextWorld! The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a green bell pepper and a carrot. Now why would someone leave that there? You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see an oven. You scan the room for a table, and you find a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You scan the room for a counter, and you find a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a yellow apple, a yellow onion, a green apple, a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? The stove appears to be empty. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is an open frosted-glass door leading west. There is an exit to the south.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe in the cookbook. The recipe requires dicing the orange bell pepper and the yellow apple, then frying them both. So far, the user has taken the knife and tried to dice the orange bell pepper but got stuck because they need the knife. They tried taking the knife from the counter, which they did, but then tried to dice the pepper again, which requires the knife.

Wait, maybe the issue is that after taking the knife, they need to use it on the pepper. The previous attempt to dice the pepper without the knife failed. Now that they have the knife, they should use it to dice the pepper. But the system message says that cutting requires a knife, so maybe they need to specify using the knife. But the user already took the knife, so the next step is to use it on the pepper. Then, after dicing, they can fry it. Then do the same for the apple. Once both are fried, they can prepare the meal, which would complete the recipe and win the game.

So the next action should be to use the knife on the orange bell pepper to dice it. The user has the knife now, so they can proceed. The previous step was taking the knife, so the next step is to apply the knife to the pepper. The command would be "dice the orange bell pepper with the knife" or something similar. But in the game's context, maybe just "dice the orange bell pepper" again, since the knife is already taken. But the system message says that cutting requires a knife, so maybe the game expects the user to use the knife explicitly. However, the user already has the knife, so the correct next step is to dice the pepper with the knife. Therefore, the next command is "dice the orange bell pepper".

Okay, let's break this down. The user is trying to follow a recipe to cook a meal. The recipe requires dicing two ingredients: an orange bell pepper and a yellow apple. The user has the knife now, but they're stuck trying to dice the pepper because the game keeps saying "Cutting something requires a knife." But they already have the knife. Wait, maybe the issue is that they need to use the knife on the pepper. The previous attempts to use "dice" didn't work because the game expects a different verb. The user tried "use knife on orange bell pepper," which wasn't recognized. So maybe the correct action is to "cut the orange bell pepper with the knife." But the game might not accept "cut" either. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to first pick up the knife, but they already did. Hmm. The recipe says "dice the orange bell pepper," but the game requires a different command. Maybe the correct verb is "cut" instead of "dice." Let me check the previous interactions. The user tried "dice" and got an error. The system message says "Cutting something requires a knife." So perhaps the correct action is to "cut the orange bell pepper" using the knife. But the user tried "use knife on..." which wasn't recognized. Maybe the correct command is "cut the orange bell pepper with the knife." But the game might not accept that. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to just use the knife on the pepper without specifying "cut." Wait, the user has the knife, so the next step is to use it on the pepper. The game might be expecting "cut" as the verb. Let me try that. So the next action should be "cut the orange bell pepper." That's the correct step. The user was stuck on "dice," but the game requires "cut." So the answer is to cut the pepper.
