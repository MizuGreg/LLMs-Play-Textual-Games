You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Livingroom =-
You are in a livingroom. An ordinary kind of place. The room is well lit.

You make out a sofa. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Hm. Oh well

There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door.

There is an exit to the north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door.

You are in a kitchen. A normal one.

You can see a fridge. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You can see a closed oven right there by you. You can make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you can make out a raw yellow potato, a red hot pepper, a tomato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a red apple and a cookbook. Were you looking for a stove? Because look over there, it's a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is a closed frosted-glass door leading east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal based on the cookbook in the kitchen. So the goal is to find the recipe, gather ingredients, and cook something.

First, they went from the living room to the bedroom, then corridor, and finally reached the kitchen. In the kitchen, they took the cookbook from the counter. Then they checked the oven, stove, and fridge. The fridge had some ingredients like vegetables and cheese. But the stove and oven are empty. So the next step is to use the ingredients from the fridge and maybe the counter to make a dish. Wait, the counter had potatoes, peppers, tomatoes, etc. Maybe they need to cook something with those. But the stove is empty, so maybe they need to put the ingredients on the stove. But the user hasn't used the cookbook yet. The cookbook was taken, but maybe they need to check the recipe steps. However, the user tried to open the cookbook but it wasn't possible initially. Now that they have it, maybe they should look at the cookbook to find the recipe. Then gather the needed ingredients from the fridge and counter. Then use the stove to cook. But the user is in the kitchen again, so the next action should be to check the cookbook for the recipe. But the previous action was looking at the fridge. So the next step is to look at the cookbook to find the recipe steps. Then collect ingredients, then cook. But the user has the cookbook, so maybe they need to read it. But the game might require using the cookbook to find the recipe. So the next action is to look at the cookbook to find the recipe. Then proceed to gather ingredients and cook.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is trying to cook a meal using the cookbook in the kitchen. The recipe requires dicing a green bell pepper, frying it, and similar steps for other ingredients. The user has the knife and the ingredients.

First, the goal is to follow the recipe steps: gather ingredients, chop/dice them, fry, and prepare the meal. So far, the user has taken the cookbook, gathered some ingredients from the fridge and counter, and tried to dice the green bell pepper but keeps getting stuck because the knife is needed. They took the knife from the table, but every time they try to cut the pepper, the game reminds them they need a knife. Wait, they already have the knife. Maybe the issue is that they need to use the knife on the pepper. But the previous attempts to "cut" the pepper without specifying the method (slice, dice, chop) are failing. The user is repeatedly trying to "dice" the pepper, but the game says they need a knife. But they have the knife. Maybe the correct action is to use the knife on the pepper. So instead of "cut green bell pepper", they should use the knife on it. The command should be "use knife on green bell pepper" or "cut green bell pepper with knife". But the game's response says "Cutting something requires a knife." So maybe the user needs to specify using the knife. Alternatively, the correct action is to "dice green bell pepper" after taking the knife. Since the user already took the knife, the next step is to actually perform the cutting action with the knife. The previous attempts to "cut" without specifying the method are failing. So the next action should be to dice the pepper using the knife. The command would be "dice green bell pepper" again, but this time with the knife in hand. However, the game keeps prompting for the method. Maybe the user needs to use the knife on the pepper. So the correct command is "cut green bell pepper with knife" or "use knife on green bell pepper". But the game's previous responses indicate that "cut" requires specifying the method. So the user should try "dice green bell pepper" again, but this time the knife is available. Since the user has the knife, the action should succeed. Therefore, the next step is to dice the green bell pepper.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe in the cookbook. The recipe requires dicing a green bell pepper, frying it, and similar steps for other ingredients. The user has the knife and the ingredients.

First, the goal is to follow the recipe steps: gather ingredients, chop/dice them, fry, and prepare the meal. So far, the user has taken the cookbook, gathered some ingredients from the fridge and counter, and tried to dice the green bell pepper but keeps getting stuck because the knife is needed. They took the knife from the table, but every time they try to cut the pepper, the game reminds them they need a knife. Wait, they already have the knife. Maybe the issue is that they need to use the knife on the pepper. The previous attempts to "cut" the pepper without specifying the method (slice, dice, chop) are failing. The user is repeatedly trying to "dice" the pepper, but the game says they need a knife. But they have the knife. Maybe the correct action is to use the knife on the pepper. So instead of "cut green bell pepper", they should use the knife on it. The command should be "use knife on green bell pepper" or "cut green bell pepper with knife". But the game's response says "Cutting something requires a knife." So maybe the user needs to specify using the knife. Alternatively, the correct action is to "dice green bell pepper" after taking the knife. Since the user already took the knife, the next step is to actually perform the cutting action with the knife. The previous attempts to "cut" without specifying the method are failing. So the next action should be to dice the green bell pepper.

Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is stuck in a loop where they keep trying to cut the green bell pepper with the knife, but the game only understands up to the point of wanting to cut it. The goal is to cook a meal using the recipe from the cookbook. The user has the knife and the ingredients.

First, the goal is to follow the recipe steps: dice the green bell pepper, fry it, slice the onion, fry it, etc. But the user can't get past the cutting step. The problem is that the game isn't recognizing the "cut with knife" command. Maybe the correct action is to use the knife on the pepper directly. The previous attempts to say "cut green bell pepper with knife" are not working. Maybe the game expects a different phrasing, like "slice the green bell pepper with the knife" or "dice the green bell pepper using the knife". Alternatively, the user might need to first use the knife on the pepper before cutting it. Since the user has the knife, the next step is to actually perform the cutting action with the knife. The loop is repeating the same command, so changing the wording slightly might help. The next action should be to dice the green bell pepper using the knife.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe. They've already taken the green bell pepper, diced it, and now they need to fry it. The previous attempts to use "fry" didn't work, so maybe they need to use a different verb. The recipe says to "fry the green bell pepper," so perhaps the correct action is to use the stove. Since the stove is in the kitchen, the user should put the diced pepper on the stove and fry it. The game might expect the command "fry green bell pepper on stove" or similar. Since "fry" wasn't working, maybe "cook" or "heat" is the correct verb. Alternatively, the user might need to specify using the stove. The next step is to fry the diced pepper using the stove.

FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe. They've already taken the green bell pepper, diced it, and now they need to fry it. The problem is that the command "fry green bell pepper on stove" isn't working. The available commands list shows that "fry" isn't a recognized verb. Maybe the correct action is to use the stove's function. Since the stove is in the kitchen, the user should put the diced pepper on the stove and then use the stove to cook it. The game might expect the command "put green bell pepper on stove" followed by "cook". Alternatively, the user might need to use the stove's action directly. The next step is to put the diced pepper on the stove and then use the stove to fry it.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe. They've already followed the steps for the green bell pepper: diced it, put it on the stove, and fried it. Now, the next steps in the recipe are to slice the yellow onion and fry it. The user needs to repeat the process for the onion. So, they should take the yellow onion from the fridge, slice it with the knife, then put it on the stove and fry it. The previous steps worked for the green bell pepper, so repeating them for the onion should work. The next action is to slice the yellow onion.

Okay, the user is stuck trying to take the yellow potato from the fridge. They've repeated the command multiple times, but the game only understands up to taking the potato. The goal is to cook the meal by following the recipe. The user has already processed the green bell pepper and yellow onion. Next, they need to handle the yellow potato. The previous steps for the onion worked, so maybe the issue is with the wording. Instead of "take yellow potato from fridge," maybe "take the yellow potato from the fridge" with the article. But the game might not recognize "the." Alternatively, the user might need to use a different verb or structure. The next step is to try taking the potato again, possibly with a different phrasing.
