You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Livingroom =-
I am stoked to announce that you are now in the livingroom.

If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a sofa. You wonder idly who left that here. But the thing is empty. Hopefully, this discovery doesn't ruin your TextWorld experience!

You need an exit without a door? You should try going north.

You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Corridor and Bathroom. The goal is to cook a meal using the cookbook in the kitchen. So first, I need to figure out how to get to the kitchen.

The user has been moving west and east between the corridor and bathroom, which suggests they're going in circles. The initial directions were going north from the living room, then south to the bedroom, then west to the corridor, and then back and forth between corridor and bathroom. 

The problem is that the corridor has an exit to the north, but the user might not have checked that. Wait, in the corridor description, there's an exit to the north. Maybe the user hasn't tried going north from the corridor yet. But in the previous steps, the user kept going west and east, missing the north exit.

So the next step should be to go north from the corridor. But the user has been going west and east repeatedly. So the loop is because they're not taking the north exit. The correct path would be from the corridor, go north to reach the kitchen. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action should be to go north from the corridor.

Of every kitchen you could have sauntered into, you had to walk into an ordinary one.

Were you looking for a fridge? Because look over there, it's a fridge. You can see an oven. You can make out a table. You see a cookbook on the table. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You smell an intriguing smell, and follow it to a counter. The counter is vast.

There is a closed frosted-glass door leading west. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to cook a meal by finding the cookbook in the kitchen and then using it. They took the cookbook from the kitchen but got stuck in a loop between the corridor and bathroom.

First, they need to use the cookbook. But in the kitchen, after taking it, they went south back to the corridor. Then they kept going west and east, looping between bathroom and corridor. The problem is they're not moving forward from the kitchen anymore.

The next step should be to use the cookbook. But in the kitchen, the user had already taken the cookbook. Maybe they need to check the ingredients or follow the recipe. However, the game might require them to go back to the kitchen again. But since they're stuck in a loop, they need to find another way out.

Wait, in the kitchen, there's a closed frosted-glass door leading west. Maybe that's the way back to the living room or another area. But the user was trying to go south from the kitchen, which led them back to the corridor. Maybe they need to go west from the kitchen through the door instead of south.

So the correct action would be to go west from the kitchen through the frosted-glass door, which would take them back to the living room or another room where they can proceed. But the user was previously going south, which led to the corridor. So changing the direction from west might break the loop.

SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the corridor and bathroom. The goal is to cook a meal using the cookbook in the kitchen. They took the cookbook but kept looping.

First step: The goal is to use the cookbook to cook, so they need to be in the kitchen again. But they keep going back and forth.

Second step: They took the cookbook from the kitchen, then went south to corridor, then west to bathroom, then east back to corridor. So they're stuck in a loop between corridor and bathroom.

Third step: The loop is because they're not moving north from the corridor. The correct path is to go north from the corridor to get back to the kitchen. But they kept going west and east. So the next action should be going north instead of west/east.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to cook a meal by using the cookbook in the kitchen. They've already taken the cookbook but are stuck in a loop between the corridor and bathroom.

First, they need to use the cookbook. But in the kitchen, the cookbook isn't openable. Maybe they need to find ingredients or follow the recipe steps. However, the game might require them to exit the current loop to reach the kitchen again.

Second, their past actions involve moving between corridor and bathroom, which isn't helping. The correct path is to go north from the corridor to get back to the kitchen. But they keep going west and east, looping instead.

Third, the loop is because they're not taking the north exit. The solution is to go north from the corridor instead of west/east. So the next action should be going north to break the loop and reach the kitchen again.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the corridor and bathroom. The goal is to cook a meal using the cookbook in the kitchen. They've taken the cookbook but can't open it. The problem is they keep looping without progressing.

First, the goal is to use the cookbook to cook. But in the kitchen, the cookbook isn't openable. Maybe they need to find ingredients or follow the recipe steps. However, the game might require them to exit the loop to reach the kitchen again.

Second, their past actions involve moving between corridor and bathroom, which isn't helping. The correct path is to go north from the corridor to get back to the kitchen. But they keep going west and east, looping instead.

Third, the loop is because they're not taking the north exit. The solution is to go north from the corridor instead of west/east. So the next action should be going north to break the loop and reach the kitchen again.

Of every kitchen you could have sauntered into, you had to walk into an ordinary one.

Were you looking for a fridge? Because look over there, it's a fridge. You can see an oven. You can make out a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. You smell an intriguing smell, and follow it to a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You make out a stove! But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

There is a closed frosted-glass door leading west. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal by finding the cookbook in the kitchen. They've been moving between rooms, eventually reaching the pantry and back. The goal is to use the cookbook to cook, but they can't open it yet.

First, the goal is to cook a meal. They need to use the cookbook, but it's not openable. Maybe they need to find ingredients or follow the recipe steps. But in the kitchen, there's nothing on the table except potatoes and a knife. The stove is empty.

Second, their past actions include taking the cookbook from the kitchen, going to the pantry, and returning. They need to use the cookbook now. Since it's not openable, maybe they need to find a way to use it without opening it, like using the ingredients on the counter.

Third, they're looping between rooms. The correct step is to use the cookbook with the ingredients. Since the cookbook is already taken, the next step is to cook using the potatoes and knife. But the game might require them to interact with the stove or oven. So the next action is to use the cookbook to cook, perhaps by combining the ingredients.
