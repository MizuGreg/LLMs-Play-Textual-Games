THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms to cook a meal using the cookbook in the kitchen. The goal is to find the kitchen, check the cookbook, and then enjoy the meal.

So far, the user has moved from the bathroom to the corridor, then to the bedroom, and back to the corridor. They've been going south and north, which seems to be looping between the corridor and bedroom. The problem is that they're stuck in a loop and need to find a way to progress further.

The next step should be to check the west direction in the corridor since that's mentioned as an unblocked entrance. Maybe the kitchen is west of the corridor. Alternatively, maybe there's a door or a different path that hasn't been explored yet. Since the previous actions of going south and north didn't lead to the kitchen, trying west might be the key. Let me make sure that's the next logical move.

Hey, want to see a fridge? Look over there, a fridge. A closed conventional looking oven is close by. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Look over there! a counter. You shudder, but continue examining the counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. You scan the room, seeing a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is a closed frosted-glass door leading south. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door. There is an exit to the west.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to cook a meal using the cookbook in the kitchen. They've already found the kitchen, took the cookbook, and looked at it. The recipe requires cheese, green bell pepper, and yellow onion. The user is stuck because they can't find the cheese on the counter.

Looking at the items on the counter: red hot pepper, raw purple potato, and a knife. The cheese isn't there. The user tried taking the cheese but couldn't. So, maybe the cheese is in another part of the kitchen. The kitchen has a fridge, oven, stove, and exits to south, east, west. The user hasn't checked the fridge yet. Since the recipe says "block of cheese," maybe it's in the fridge. The user should check the fridge next. Alternatively, maybe the cheese is in the pantry or another room, but the current location is the kitchen. The next logical step is to open the fridge to look for the cheese. The user hasn't done that yet. So the next action should be to open the fridge.

Okay, let's see. The user needs to cook a meal according to the recipe in the cookbook. The recipe requires cheese, green bell pepper, and yellow onion. The user has already taken the cheese and the green bell pepper from the fridge. The next ingredient needed is the yellow onion.

Looking at the current location, the user is in the kitchen. The items available include a stove, oven, and exits. The user needs to find the yellow onion. Previously, the user checked the fridge and found the yellow onion there. Wait, in the previous step, when the user opened the fridge, the yellow onion was listed. So the user might have already taken it, but maybe not. Let me check the history.

Wait, the user took the cheese and the green bell pepper. The yellow onion is still in the fridge. So the next step is to take the yellow onion from the fridge. But the user might have already taken it. Wait, no, the user hasn't taken the yellow onion yet. The recipe says to slice the yellow onion, so it needs to be obtained. The user needs to take the yellow onion from the fridge. So the next action should be to take the yellow onion from the fridge. But the user might have already done that. Wait, in the previous steps, the user took cheese and green bell pepper. The yellow onion is still in the fridge. So the next step is to take the yellow onion. Then, follow the directions: dice the cheese, fry it, dice the pepper, roast it, slice the onion, roast the onion, then prepare the meal. Once all ingredients are gathered, the user can cook the meal. So the next action is to take the yellow onion from the fridge.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal using the recipe from the cookbook. They need to gather the ingredients: cheese, green bell pepper, and yellow onion. They've already taken the cheese and green bell pepper from the fridge. The yellow onion is in the fridge too, but they can't carry more items.

The problem is they're carrying too many things. So instead of taking the yellow onion from the fridge, maybe they should leave one of the other items. Wait, the recipe says to dice the cheese, fry it, dice the green bell pepper, roast it, slice the yellow onion, and roast the onion. Maybe they don't need to take all the ingredients at once. But the game requires taking them from the fridge.

Alternatively, maybe the user can use the stove or oven to cook the ingredients once they're gathered. But the issue is carrying capacity. The user has already taken the cheese and green bell pepper, so adding the yellow onion would exceed the limit. So perhaps the next step is to leave the green bell pepper and take the yellow onion instead? But the recipe needs both. Hmm.

Wait, the user took the cheese and green bell pepper. The yellow onion is still in the fridge. The user can't take it because they're carrying too much. So maybe the solution is to drop one of the items they already have. But the game might not allow dropping. Alternatively, maybe the user can use the stove to cook the cheese and green bell pepper first, then take the onion. But the recipe steps require having all ingredients ready.

Alternatively, maybe the user can take the yellow onion from the counter instead of the fridge? But the counter has a red hot pepper and a potato. The fridge has the yellow onion. So the correct action is to take the yellow onion from the fridge, but the game says they can't carry more. So perhaps the user needs to find a way to carry all three. Maybe the user can take the yellow onion from the fridge without taking the green bell pepper? But the recipe requires both. This is confusing. The user needs to follow the recipe steps, but the game's mechanics are preventing them from carrying all items. So the next step is to take the yellow onion from the fridge, even if it means carrying all three, but the game says they can't. So maybe the user has to find another way, like using the stove or oven to cook the ingredients without carrying them all. But the game requires taking the ingredients first. I'm stuck. The correct action is to take the yellow onion from the fridge, even if it's over the limit. Maybe the game allows it. Or maybe the user should leave the green bell pepper and take the onion. But the recipe needs both. I think the next step is to take the yellow onion from the fridge, even if it's over the limit.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to cook a meal using the recipe from the cookbook. They need to gather cheese, green bell pepper, and yellow onion. They've taken the cheese and green bell pepper, but can't carry the yellow onion. They tried taking it but got a message about carrying too many things. Then they dropped the green bell pepper into the fridge to free up space.

Now, the next step is to take the yellow onion from the fridge. Since they dropped the green bell pepper, they can now carry the yellow onion. So the action should be to take the yellow onion from the fridge. That way, they have all three ingredients: cheese, yellow onion, and the green bell pepper is back in the fridge. Then they can follow the recipe steps to cook the meal. The key is to make sure they have all ingredients without exceeding the carrying limit. So the next command is to take the yellow onion from the fridge.

Okay, let's see. The user needs to cook a meal according to the recipe. They've gathered all three ingredients: cheese, green bell pepper, and yellow onion. The next step is to follow the directions in the recipe. The recipe says to dice the cheese, fry it, then dice the pepper, roast it, slice the onion, roast the onion, and prepare the meal.

The user tried "follow directions" but it wasn't recognized. Then they tried "dice the block of cheese" but were asked to use a knife. The knife is on the counter. So the next step is to use the knife on the cheese. But the user might not have the knife in their inventory. Wait, the counter has a knife. So they need to take the knife first. But the user is carrying the cheese, onion, and maybe the green bell pepper. Wait, no, the green bell pepper was dropped into the fridge. So the user is carrying the cheese and the yellow onion. The knife is on the counter. So the correct action is to take the knife from the counter, then use it to dice the cheese. Then proceed with the recipe steps. But the user might not have the knife yet. So the next step is to take the knife from the counter.

The user tried to use the knife but couldn't because they were carrying too many things. The knife is on the counter. So the solution is to drop one of the ingredients to free up space. The user already has the cheese and the onion. Maybe they can drop the onion and take the knife, then proceed. But the recipe requires all ingredients. Alternatively, maybe they can use the stove or oven to cook the ingredients without carrying them all. But the game requires taking the ingredients first. So the next step is to drop the onion and take the knife, then use it to dice the cheese. Then proceed with the recipe steps. But the user needs to follow the exact steps. So the next action is to use the knife on the cheese, even if it means dropping something else. But the user can't carry more.

Okay, the user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe. They've diced the cheese, but now they need to fry it. The previous attempts to use "fry" didn't work, so maybe the correct verb is "sear" or "sauté". Since the recipe says "fry", perhaps the game expects a different term. Alternatively, maybe "cook" is the right verb. The user has the cheese and the knife, so the next step is to fry the cheese using the stove. The correct action should be to use the stove to fry the cheese.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop where they can't carry all the ingredients. They need to follow the recipe steps: dice cheese, fry it, dice pepper, roast it, slice onion, roast onion, then prepare the meal. They've already diced the cheese and fried it. Now, they need the green bell pepper and yellow onion. But they can't carry both. The solution is to drop one of them to free up space. The user previously dropped the yellow onion, so they need to take it back. But the game says they can't carry too many things. Maybe the correct action is to take the green bell pepper from the fridge, even if it means leaving the yellow onion. Then proceed with the recipe steps. The next action should be to take the green bell pepper from the fridge.

THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop where they can't carry all the ingredients. They need to follow the recipe steps: dice cheese, fry it, dice pepper, roast it, slice onion, roast onion, then prepare the meal. They've already diced the cheese and fried it. Now, they need the green bell pepper and yellow onion. But they can't carry both. The solution is to drop one of them to free up space. The user previously dropped the yellow onion, so they need to take it back. But the game says they can't carry too many things. Maybe the correct action is to take the green bell pepper from the fridge, even if it means leaving the yellow onion. Then proceed with the recipe steps. The next action should be to take the green bell pepper from the fridge.
