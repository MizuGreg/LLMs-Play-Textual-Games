You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You've just walked into a kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

You see a fridge. The fridge contains a yellow onion, a raw white tuna, a white onion, a raw red tuna, a yellow bell pepper, a red onion and a red bell pepper. Now why would someone leave that there? You can make out an oven. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. You scan the room, seeing a table. The table is massive. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a yellow apple, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe in the cookbook. The recipe requires chopping white tuna, roasting it, chopping a yellow onion, frying it, chopping and frying a yellow potato. So far, they've picked up the knife and tried to cut the white tuna but got a message that cutting requires a knife. Wait, maybe the action needs to be phrased differently. The previous attempt was "cut white tuna with knife," but the system said it wasn't understood. Maybe the correct action is "chop white tuna" but they need to have the knife in hand. They already picked up the knife, so maybe the next step is to actually chop it. Alternatively, maybe the system expects the command to be "chop the white tuna" without specifying the knife, but since the knife is in hand, that should work. But the user tried that and got the same message. Hmm, maybe the system is expecting a different verb, like "slice" instead of "chop"? Or maybe "dice" as per the recipe. Wait, the recipe says "dice the white tuna," so maybe the correct action is "dice white tuna." But the user tried "chop" and "cut." Maybe the system is confused between chop and dice. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the knife to chop the tuna. Let me check the previous steps. The user picked up the knife, so the next action should be to chop the tuna with the knife. But the system said "cutting requires a knife," so maybe the correct command is "chop white tuna with knife." But the user tried that and got the same message. Maybe the system is not recognizing "chop" and expects "slice" or "dice." Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the knife on the tuna. Wait, the knife is in hand, so the action should be "chop white tuna" and the system should recognize it. But the user tried that and got the message. Maybe the system is in a loop because the action isn't being recognized. So the next step is to try a different verb, like "dice" instead of "chop." Let's try that.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is trying to follow a recipe to cook a meal. The recipe has specific steps: dice white tuna, roast it, chop yellow onion, fry onion, chop and fry yellow potato. So far, the user has successfully diced the white tuna. Now, the next step is to roast the white tuna.

But the user is having trouble with the verb "roast." The system isn't recognizing it. Maybe "roast" isn't the correct verb here. Perhaps the correct action is to "put in oven" or "place in oven." Since the recipe says "roast the white tuna," but the system doesn't accept "roast," the user needs to find an alternative way to express that action. Maybe using "put in oven" or "place in oven" would work. The user tried "roast white tuna in oven" but it didn't work. So the next step is to try a different phrasing, like "put white tuna in oven" or "place white tuna in oven." That should be the correct action to proceed.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook according to the recipe. The current step is after roasting the white tuna, but there's a loop here. The user tried "roast white tuna" but it wasn't recognized. Then they put the tuna back in the oven, took it out, and now they're stuck again.

The goal is to follow the recipe steps: dice white tuna, roast it, chop onion, fry onion, chop and fry potato. So far, the user has diced the tuna and put it in the oven. But the system isn't recognizing "roast" as a verb. Maybe the correct action is to "put in oven" again, but that didn't work. Alternatively, maybe "heat oven" or "preheat oven" is needed before roasting. But the recipe says "roast the white tuna," so perhaps the system expects a different command. The user needs to find a synonym for "roast" that the system accepts. Since "roast" isn't working, maybe "bake" or "cook" could be alternatives. But the recipe specifically says "roast," so maybe the system is expecting "put in oven" again. However, the user already did that. Maybe the next step is to move on to the next part of the recipe, like chopping the onion, even though the tuna isn't fully roasted yet. But the recipe requires roasting first. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the stove for roasting instead of the oven. Wait, the stove is conventional, but the oven is mentioned. Maybe the correct action is to use the stove's heat. But the recipe says "roast," which usually implies an oven. Hmm. The user is stuck in a loop between putting the tuna in the oven and taking it out. The next step should be to try a different verb for roasting, like "bake" or "cook," but the system might not accept it. Alternatively, maybe the user should proceed to the next step in the recipe, even if the previous step isn't fully completed. But the recipe requires roasting first. So the correct action is to find a synonym for "roast" that the system recognizes. Since "roast" isn't working, maybe "bake" is the alternative. Let's try that.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is trying to follow a recipe to cook a meal. The current step is after roasting the white tuna, but there's a loop here. The user tried "roast white tuna" but it wasn't recognized. Then they put the tuna back in the oven, took it out, and now they're stuck again.

The goal is to follow the recipe steps: dice white tuna, roast it, chop onion, fry onion, chop and fry potato. So far, the user has diced the tuna and put it in the oven. But the system isn't recognizing "roast" as a verb. Maybe the correct action is to "put in oven" again, but that didn't work. Alternatively, maybe "heat oven" or "preheat oven" is needed before roasting. But the recipe says "roast," so perhaps the system expects a different command. The user needs to find a synonym for "roast" that the system accepts. Since "roast" isn't working, maybe "bake" or "cook" could be alternatives. But the recipe specifically says "roast," so maybe the system is expecting "put in oven" again. However, the user already did that. Maybe the next step is to move on to the next part of the recipe, like chopping the onion, even if the tuna isn't fully roasted yet. But the recipe requires roasting first. Alternatively, maybe the user should use the stove's heat. But the recipe says "roast," which usually implies an oven. Hmm. The user is stuck in a loop between putting the tuna in the oven and taking it out. The correct action is to find a synonym for "roast" that the system recognizes. Since "roast" isn't working, maybe "bake" is the alternative. Let's try that.

Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is trying to cook according to the recipe, but they're stuck on the "roast white tuna" step. The system isn't recognizing "roast" as a verb. They've tried putting the tuna in the oven multiple times, but it's not working. The goal is to follow the recipe steps: dice white tuna, roast it, chop onion, fry onion, chop and fry potato. So far, they've diced the tuna and put it in the oven. But the system isn't accepting "roast," so maybe they need to use a different verb. Maybe "bake" or "cook" instead? But the recipe says "roast," so maybe the system expects a different command. Alternatively, maybe they need to use the stove instead of the oven. But the recipe specifies "roast," which is usually done in an oven. The user is in a loop between putting the tuna in the oven and taking it out. The next step should be to try a different action, like "cook" instead of "roast," but the system might not accept it. Alternatively, maybe they need to proceed to the next step in the recipe, even if the previous step isn't fully completed. But the recipe requires roasting first.

The user tried "fry yellow onion in pan" but it wasn't recognized. Then they tried "put yellow onion in pan" but the system said they can't see any such thing. The goal is to follow the recipe steps: dice white tuna, roast it, chop onion, fry onion, chop and fry potato. So far, they've completed the first four steps. Now, the next step is to chop the yellow potato and fry it. But the user is stuck on the onion frying part. The system isn't recognizing "fry" or "put in pan." Maybe the correct action is to use the stove's heat. Since the stove is conventional, maybe "heat pan" or "place in pan" is needed. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the oven again, but the recipe says fry. So the next step is to try a different command for frying, like "heat pan" or "cook in pan." But the system might not accept those. The user needs to find a synonym for "fry" that works. Since "fry" isn't working, maybe "cook" or "sear." But the recipe says "fry," so perhaps the system expects "put in pan" again. However, the user already tried that.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a recipe to cook a meal. The current step is after frying the yellow onion, but they're stuck. The goal is to follow the recipe steps: dice white tuna, roast it, chop onion, fry onion, chop and fry potato. So far, they've completed the first four steps. Now, the next step is to chop the yellow potato and fry it. But the user is stuck on the onion frying part. The system isn't recognizing "fry" or "put in pan." Maybe the correct action is to use the stove's heat. Since the stove is conventional, maybe "heat pan" or "place in pan" is needed. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the oven again, but the recipe says fry. So the next step is to try a different command for frying, like "heat pan" or "cook in pan." But the system might not accept those. The user needs to find a synonym for "fry" that works. Since "fry" isn't working, maybe "cook" or "sear." But the recipe says "fry," so perhaps the system expects "put in pan" again. However, the user already tried that. The correct action is to proceed to the next step in the recipe, which is chopping the yellow potato. But the user is stuck on the onion. So the next step is to try a different verb for frying, like "heat pan" or "cook in pan."
