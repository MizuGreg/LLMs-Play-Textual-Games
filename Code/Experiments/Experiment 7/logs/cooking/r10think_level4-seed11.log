THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Bedroom and Livingroom. The goal is to cook a meal by finding a recipe in the kitchen. But so far, the user has been going back and forth between east and west, which isn't helping.

First, I need to recall the original task: find the cookbook in the kitchen, follow the recipe, then enjoy the meal. The current location is the Bedroom, but the kitchen isn't mentioned yet. The exits are east and west, which loop between the two rooms. So the problem is that the user isn't moving towards the kitchen.

Looking at the previous steps, every time they go east, they end up in the Bedroom again, and west takes them to the Livingroom. But neither room mentions a kitchen or a cookbook. So maybe the kitchen is another room not yet explored. But the current exits don't include north or south. Wait, in the Livingroom description, there's an exit to the north. Maybe the kitchen is north of the Livingroom?

But the user has been going west and east, which are the same rooms. So the next step is to try going north from the Livingroom. The user was told in the Livingroom to try west, but maybe north is the way to the kitchen. Since the previous actions were repeating, the user needs to try a different direction. The loop is between Bedroom and Livingroom, so going north from Livingroom might be the key. Let me check the previous messages. In the Livingroom, the exit to the north is mentioned. So the next action should be to go north from the Livingroom, which hasn't been tried yet. That's the next step to break the loop and proceed towards the kitchen.

You've just sauntered into a corridor.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. A typical kind of place.

You can make out an opened fridge. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper and a green bell pepper. You make out a closed oven right there by you. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Silly table, silly, empty, good for nothing table. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a cookbook and a knife. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You scan the room for a stove, and you find a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

There is an open frosted-glass door leading west. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to cook a meal using the cookbook found in the kitchen. So far, they've taken the cookbook, opened it, and started preparing the recipe. The current step is to dice the orange bell pepper, but they need the knife.

Wait, the user has the orange bell pepper but hasn't used the knife yet. The previous action was "dice the orange bell pepper," but the system responded that cutting requires a knife. So the next step is to take the knife from the counter. Once they have the knife, they can properly dice the pepper. Then, follow the recipe's directions to roast it and prepare the meal. The next action should be to take the knife to proceed.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal using the recipe from the cookbook. They've taken the cookbook, found the orange bell pepper and knife, but are having trouble cutting the pepper because they need to specify the action correctly.

First, the goal is to follow the recipe: dice the pepper, roast it, then prepare the meal. So far, they've taken the cookbook and the knife, but haven't actually diced the pepper yet. The problem is that the system is expecting a specific command format. The user tried "dice the orange bell pepper" but the system said cutting requires a knife, which is true, but maybe they need to use the knife first.

Wait, the user already has the knife. The previous attempt was "use knife on orange bell pepper", which didn't work. Maybe the correct command is "cut orange bell pepper with knife" or "dice orange bell pepper with knife". But the system keeps saying it's not recognized. Alternatively, maybe the correct verb is "slice" instead of "dice"? But the recipe says "dice".

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the knife on the pepper. The system might be expecting "cut" as the verb. But the user tried "cut" and it didn't work. Hmm. The user is stuck in a loop where they can't get the pepper diced because the commands aren't recognized. The next step is to find a different way to phrase the action, maybe using "slice" instead of "dice", or using "cut" with the knife specified. Since the system is not recognizing "dice", perhaps "slice" is the correct verb here. Let me check the previous messages. The recipe says "dice", but the system might be expecting a different verb. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the knife to cut the pepper. So the correct command would be "cut orange bell pepper with knife". But the system said it's not recognized. Maybe the correct command is "cut the orange bell pepper with the knife". But the user has to be concise. The next action should be to use the knife to cut the pepper, even if the system is not recognizing it. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to just cut the pepper, and the knife is already in hand. So the next step is to cut the pepper, and the system will accept it.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal using the recipe from the cookbook. The recipe says to dice the orange bell pepper. But every time they try to use the knife, the system doesn't recognize the command. The user has the knife and the pepper, but can't get the action to work.

First, the goal is to cook the meal by following the recipe. So far, they've taken the cookbook, found the pepper and knife, but haven't diced the pepper yet. The problem is that the commands aren't being recognized. The system might be expecting a specific verb or structure.

The user tried "dice the orange bell pepper" but got a response about needing a knife. Then they tried using the knife, but the system didn't recognize "use knife on..." or "use knife to cut". Maybe the correct command is just "cut the orange bell pepper" without mentioning the knife, since the knife is already in hand. Alternatively, maybe the system wants the verb "slice" instead of "dice". But the recipe says "dice".

Wait, the user is in a loop where they can't get the action to work. The next step is to try a different verb or structure. Since "dice" isn't working, maybe "slice" is the correct verb here. Or perhaps the system wants the command to be "cut the orange bell pepper with the knife". But the user has to be concise. The next action should be to slice the pepper, even if the system says it's not recognized. Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "cut the orange bell pepper".
