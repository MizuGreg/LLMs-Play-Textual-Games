You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. A normal one.

You see a fridge. The fridge contains a red onion, a raw pork chop, a raw white tuna, a red bell pepper, a yellow onion, a white onion and a raw red tuna. You can see a closed oven. You scan the room, seeing a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. You scan the room for a counter, and you find a counter. On the counter you can make out a raw yellow potato. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You smell an intriguing smell, and follow it to a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal in the kitchen. The goal is to check the cookbook for a recipe and then cook something. So far, they've put a red onion and a pork chop into the oven. But they need to follow the recipe from the cookbook.

Wait, the initial instruction said to check the cookbook in the kitchen. Did they do that yet? The user mentioned the cookbook is on the table along with a knife. So maybe the next step is to take the cookbook and look at the recipe. But the current actions are about putting ingredients in the oven. Maybe they need to first find the recipe, then prepare the ingredients according to it. But the game's scoring seems to be based on putting ingredients in the oven. However, the user hasn't opened the cookbook yet. So the next logical step is to take the cookbook, check the recipe, and then proceed with the cooking steps as per the recipe. But the user's last action was putting the red bell pepper in the oven, which they couldn't do because they needed to take it first. So maybe the next step is to take the red bell pepper from the fridge, then put it in the oven. But the user is stuck because they need to take each ingredient before putting it in. Alternatively, maybe the recipe requires certain steps, and the user needs to follow the cookbook's instructions. But since the user hasn't checked the cookbook yet, that might be the missing step. So the correct next action is to take the cookbook from the table to check the recipe.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe in the cookbook. The goal is to follow the recipe's steps correctly.

First, the recipe says to dice the pork chop, fry it, then chop and fry the red onion, and dice and fry the white tuna. So far, the user has taken the pork chop and red onion, but they're stuck on chopping because they need the knife. They tried using the knife but got errors. The problem is that the user is trying to "chop" but the system expects a different verb, like "cut" or "slice".

Looking at the previous interactions, the user tried "chop the red onion" but the system said cutting requires a knife. Then they tried "use the knife on the red onion", which wasn't recognized. The correct action here is to use the knife to cut the onion, but the system might not accept "cut" as a verb. So the user needs to use the knife on the onion, perhaps with the right verb.

The next step is to use the knife to cut the red onion. Since "chop" isn't working, maybe "cut" is the right verb. So the command should be "cut the red onion with the knife" or similar. But the system might require a different phrasing. Alternatively, since the user has the knife, they can "cut the red onion" after taking the knife. But the user already took the knife. So the correct action is to cut the onion with the knife.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe. The goal is to follow the steps in the cookbook. So far, they've taken the pork chop and red onion, used the knife, but keep getting stuck on the verb for cutting.

The recipe says to "chop the pork chop" and "chop the red onion". But the system doesn't recognize "chop" as a valid verb. The user tried "cut" but the system only understood "cut the red onion". Maybe the correct verb is "cut" instead of "chop". But the system is expecting a different command. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the knife on the onion without the verb. Wait, the previous attempt was "cut the red onion with the knife", but the system didn't recognize it. Maybe the correct action is just "cut the red onion" without mentioning the knife, since the knife is already in hand. Or perhaps the system requires the knife to be used directly. But the user already took the knife. So the next step is to use the knife to cut the onion. The system might be expecting "cut" as the verb. But the user keeps getting errors. Maybe the correct command is "cut the red onion" without the knife mention. Let me check the previous interactions. The user tried "cut the red onion with the knife" but the system didn't recognize it. So maybe the correct command is just "cut the red onion". But the system said "I only understood you as far as wanting to cut the red onion." So maybe the system is expecting the action to be "cut" but the user is trying to use the knife. Wait, the user has the knife. So the correct action is to use the knife to cut the onion. But the system might not accept "use the knife to cut the red onion". Alternatively, the correct verb is "cut" without the knife. But the user needs to use the knife. Hmm. Maybe the system is expecting "cut" as the verb, so the next step is to just "cut the red onion".

Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is in a kitchen game where they need to cook a meal using the recipe from the cookbook. The main goal is to follow the recipe steps correctly.

First, the recipe requires gathering ingredients: pork chop, red onion, and white tuna. The user has already taken the pork chop and red onion, but the white tuna is still in the fridge. They need to get that too. Then, the directions say to dice the pork chop, fry it, chop and fry the red onion, and dice and fry the white tuna. So far, the user has tried chopping the pork chop but kept getting stuck on the verb. They tried "chop", "cut", "slice", but the system didn't recognize them. Maybe the correct verb is "dice" instead of "chop" or "cut". Also, they need to take the white tuna from the fridge next.

Wait, the user is getting confused between the red bell pepper and red tuna. But the recipe specifies red onion, not bell pepper. So maybe the system is confused with the items in the fridge. The user needs to take the white tuna, not the bell pepper. So the next step is to take the white tuna from the fridge. Then, follow the recipe steps properly. But the user is stuck on the verb for cutting. Maybe the correct action is to "dice" the pork chop and red onion, and "dice" the white tuna. But the system might require specific verbs. Alternatively, the user needs to use the knife on each ingredient as per the recipe steps. So the next action should be taking the white tuna from the fridge.

Maybe the user needs to put the tuna on the stove and then fry it. But the system might require the exact command. Since "fry" isn't working, maybe the next step is to "cook the white tuna" or "heat the white tuna on the stove".

Okay, let's break this down. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe. The goal is to follow the steps in the cookbook. So far, they've taken the white tuna, diced it, and fried it. Now they need to handle the pork chop and red onion.

The recipe says to dice the pork chop, fry it, chop and fry the red onion. The user has the knife and the stove. They tried to cook the pork chop but got an error. The system says they need to take the pork chop first, but it's not on the counter. Wait, the user took the pork chop from the fridge earlier, but maybe it's not in their inventory. They need to take it again. Alternatively, maybe the pork chop is on the counter. The user tried taking it from the counter but couldn't. So the next step is to take the pork chop from the fridge again. But the system says they can't see it. Maybe the pork chop is already in their inventory. Wait, the user took it earlier but maybe it's not visible. So the correct action is to take the pork chop from the fridge again. But the system says they can't see it. Maybe the pork chop is on the counter. The user needs to check the counter again. Alternatively, the system is confused. The next step is to take the pork chop from the fridge again.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is stuck because they can't find the pork chop in the fridge. The game's goal is to cook a meal using the recipe from the cookbook. The user has already taken the white tuna, diced it, and fried it. Now they need to handle the pork chop and red onion.

The recipe says to dice the pork chop, fry it, chop and fry the red onion. The user has the knife and the stove. They tried to take the pork chop from the fridge but got an error. Maybe the pork chop is already in their inventory from a previous step. Wait, earlier the user took the pork chop from the fridge, but the system didn't confirm it. Maybe the pork chop is on the counter. The user needs to check the counter again. Alternatively, the system is confused and the correct action is to use the knife on the pork chop. But the user needs to take it first. Since the system says they can't see it, maybe the correct action is to take it from the fridge again, even though it's not visible. Alternatively, the user might need to use a different verb or action. The next step is to take the pork chop from the fridge again, even if it's not visible.
