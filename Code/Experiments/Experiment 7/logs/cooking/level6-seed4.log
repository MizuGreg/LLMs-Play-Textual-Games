You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. A standard kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

You can make out a fridge. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? The fridge contains a raw white tuna, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a white onion and a raw red tuna. You can see an oven. Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a raw yellow potato, a red hot pepper, a yellow apple, a banana, a red bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a yellow onion, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato and a knife. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.

There is an open plain door leading south. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door.

Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is in a kitchen, and the goal is to cook a meal using the ingredients from the fridge and counter. The cookbook wasn't helpful because looking in it didn't yield any recipes. So, the next step should be to use the ingredients available.

Wait, the user has already checked the cookbook but found nothing. Maybe the recipe is implied by the ingredients? Like, combining certain items. The fridge has tuna, carrot, pepper, onion. The counter has potatoes, peppers, apples, bananas, onions, a knife. Maybe the user needs to cook a dish like a salad or a stir-fry. But how to proceed?

The user is stuck on looking in the cookbook again and again. The system is probably expecting a different action. Instead of looking in the cookbook, maybe the user should start preparing the ingredients. For example, using the knife to chop vegetables. Or maybe the recipe is to make a specific dish with the available items. Since the cookbook didn't help, perhaps the user needs to use the ingredients directly. The next action should be to use the knife on an ingredient, like chopping a carrot or onion. That would be a practical step towards cooking.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is trying to cook a meal in the kitchen. They've already taken some ingredients and started chopping. The current issue is that they need to cook the chopped carrot with the onion, but there are two onions available: white and yellow. The user is confused which one to use.

First, the goal is to cook a meal using the ingredients from the fridge and counter. The user has taken the carrot and the knife, chopped the carrot. Now they need to use the onion. Since the cookbook didn't provide a recipe, maybe the correct approach is to use the available onions. The white onion is in the fridge, and the yellow onion is on the counter. The user might need to take one of them.

But the system is prompting for a specific action. The user tried "cook the chopped carrot with the onion" and was asked to specify which onion. So the next step is to take one of the onions. Since the user previously took the carrot from the fridge, maybe they should take the white onion from the fridge. Alternatively, the yellow onion is on the counter. The user needs to take one of them to proceed.

The previous actions were taking the carrot from the fridge, taking the knife, chopping the carrot. Now, the next logical step is to take an onion. The user might have to take the white onion from the fridge or the yellow onion from the counter. Since the user is in the kitchen, maybe the white onion is in the fridge, so take that. Then, cook the carrot with the onion. But the system might expect a different action. Alternatively, maybe the user should use the yellow onion on the counter. The key is to take one of the onions and then cook the carrot with it. The user needs to specify which onion to take. The correct action would be to take the white onion from the fridge.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal in the kitchen. They've gathered some ingredients: carrot, white onion, and a knife. They've chopped the carrot and taken the onion. Now they need to cook it. The problem is that the previous attempts to use the stove to cook the carrot and onion aren't working because the system doesn't recognize the verb.

So, the goal is to cook a meal. The user has the ingredients and the stove. The next step should be to use the stove correctly. The error messages indicate that "cook" isn't the right verb here. Maybe the correct action is to "put" the ingredients on the stove or "heat" the stove. But the system might expect a specific command like "heat the stove" or "use the stove to heat the carrot and onion."

Since the user is stuck in a loop of trying to cook but getting errors, they need to try a different verb. Maybe "heat" is the correct verb instead of "cook." So the next action should be to heat the stove with the carrot and onion. Alternatively, "put the carrot and onion on the stove" might work. But the system might require a more direct command. The key is to find a verb that the system accepts for heating the ingredients on the stove.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is trying to cook a meal in the kitchen. They've gathered ingredients like carrot, onion, and a knife. They've chopped the carrot and put the onion on the stove. The previous attempts to heat the stove or cook the ingredients didn't work because the system didn't recognize the verbs.

The goal is to cook a meal, so the next step is to actually cook the ingredients. Since the system isn't accepting "heat" or "cook," maybe the correct action is to "put" the ingredients on the stove and then "use" the stove to cook them. But the user has already put the carrot and onion on the stove. Maybe the next step is to "turn on" the stove or "light" it. Alternatively, since the system might expect a specific command, maybe "cook the carrot and onion" is the correct verb, even if it's not recognized. But the user has to try different synonyms. The key is to find a verb that the system accepts for cooking.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal in the kitchen. They've taken the carrot, chopped it, taken the white onion, and put both on the stove. The problem is that the system isn't accepting commands like "cook" or "heat" when using multiple objects.

The goal is to cook a meal, so the next step is to actually cook the ingredients. Since the previous attempts to use verbs like "cook" with multiple objects failed, maybe the correct action is to use a single object. But the user has both carrot and onion on the stove. Wait, maybe the system expects a different verb, like "start" or "light" the stove. Alternatively, since the user has already put the ingredients on the stove, maybe the next step is to "turn on" the stove. But the system might not recognize that. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "use" the stove to cook the ingredients. But the system says "multiple objects" is not allowed. So perhaps the user should cook one item at a time. But the user has both on the stove. Hmm. The key is to find a verb that the system accepts without multiple objects. Maybe "heat" the stove instead of the ingredients. But the user needs to heat the ingredients. Alternatively, "cook" the carrot alone, then the onion. But the user has both on the stove. This is tricky. The correct action might be to "heat the stove" without the ingredients, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, "cook the carrot" and then "cook the onion" separately. But the system might not allow that. The user needs to find a way to proceed without using multiple objects. Maybe the answer is to "cook the carrot and onion" even if it's not allowed, but the system says it's not recognized. So the next step is to try a different verb or structure.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

<think>
Okay, the user is stuck in a loop where they keep trying to take the white onion from the fridge, but the system isn't recognizing it. The goal is to cook a meal, so they need to actually use the ingredients. They've already taken the carrot and chopped it. The next step should be to cook the carrot and onion. But the system is having trouble with multiple objects. Maybe the correct action is to cook the carrot first, then the onion. But the user has both on the stove. The system might expect a different verb, like "heat" instead of "cook". Alternatively, maybe the user should just cook the carrot on the stove without the onion. But the system says they need to take the onion first. Wait, they already took the onion. This is confusing. The correct command might be to "use the stove to cook the carrot and onion", but the system doesn't recognize that. So the next step is to try a different approach, maybe cooking one at a time.
