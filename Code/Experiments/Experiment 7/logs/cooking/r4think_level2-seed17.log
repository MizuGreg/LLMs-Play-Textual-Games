You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. A normal one.

You make out a fridge. The fridge contains a red onion, a raw pork chop, a red bell pepper, a yellow onion, a carrot, a lettuce and an orange bell pepper. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's an oven. You wonder idly who left that here. You scan the room, seeing a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to a stove. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

Okay, let me try to figure out what to do next. The user is in a kitchen game where they need to cook a meal using the ingredients from the fridge. The cookbook recipe says they need a pork chop and a red onion. They've already taken both ingredients, so the next step is probably to start cooking.

Looking at the directions: chop the pork chop, fry the pork chop, dice the red onion, fry the red onion, then prepare the meal. They have the ingredients, so they need to perform these actions. The user has the pork chop and red onion in their inventory now. 

The next logical step would be to chop the pork chop. But wait, in the game, they might need to use the knife from the table. The user mentioned there's a knife on the table. So maybe they need to take the knife first. But the previous actions were taking the pork chop and onion. The user might have already taken the knife, but the game didn't mention it. Wait, the initial description said the table has a cookbook and a knife. So the user hasn't taken the knife yet. 

But the recipe says to chop the pork chop. To chop, they need the knife. So the next step should be to take the knife from the table. Then, chop the pork chop. But the user's last action was taking the red onion. So the next action should be to take the knife. Then, chop the pork chop. But the user might not have the knife yet. Let me check the game state again.

The user is in the kitchen, with the pork chop and red onion. The table has a knife. So the next step is to take the knife. Then, chop the pork chop. But the user hasn't taken the knife yet. So the next action should be to take the knife. Then, chop the pork chop. But the user might need to use the knife to chop. So the correct sequence is: take knife, chop pork chop, fry pork chop, dice onion, fry onion, prepare meal.

But the user's last action was taking the red onion. So the next step is to take the knife. Then, chop the pork chop. But the user might not have the knife yet. So the next action is to take the knife. Then, chop the pork chop. But the user's previous actions were taking the pork chop and red onion. So the next step is to take the knife. Then, chop the pork chop. But the user might not have the knife yet. So the correct next action is to take the knife from the table.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe from the cookbook. The recipe requires chopping and frying the pork chop and red onion. So far, they've taken the pork chop, red onion, and knife. They chopped the pork chop, but now they're stuck on the "fry" part.

The previous attempts to use "fry pork chop" weren't recognized. Maybe the game expects a different phrasing. Instead of "fry," perhaps "cook" or "sear" is the correct verb. Alternatively, maybe they need to use the stove. The user mentioned a stove in the kitchen, but earlier it was described as empty. Wait, the stove might be the place where frying happens. So maybe the next step is to use the stove to fry the pork chop.

But the user hasn't interacted with the stove yet. The recipe says to fry the pork chop, so they need to put it on the stove. So the correct action would be to put the pork chop on the stove and then fry it. Alternatively, maybe "fry the pork chop on the stove." But the game might require a specific command. Since "fry" alone isn't working, perhaps using "cook" or "sear" instead. Or maybe the stove needs to be used first.

Wait, the user has the knife and the pork chop. The next step after chopping is to fry. Since "fry" isn't working, maybe the correct command is "put the pork chop on the stove" or "cook the pork chop." But the game might expect "fry" with the stove. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the stove first. Let me check the previous steps again.

The user has the pork chop and knife. They chopped it. Now, they need to fry it. The stove is in the kitchen. So the correct action is to go to the stove and then fry the pork chop. But the user is already in the kitchen. So maybe the next step is to use the stove to fry the pork chop. The correct command might be "fry the pork chop on the stove" or "cook the pork chop on the stove." Since "fry" alone isn't working, maybe "cook" is the right verb here. Alternatively, the game might require using the stove as an object. So the next action should be to use the stove to fry the pork chop.

But the previous attempt to use "fry" didn't work, so maybe they need to use a different verb or action.

The user tried "fry the pork chop on the stove" but it wasn't recognized. Then they tried "put pork chop on stove", which worked. Now, after putting it on the stove, the next step is to fry it. Since "fry" isn't working, maybe the correct action is to use the stove's function. Alternatively, maybe they need to use the word "cook" instead of "fry". Or perhaps they need to interact with the stove in another way, like turning it on.

Wait, the recipe says "fry the pork chop", so the action should be frying. But the game might require a specific command. Since "fry" didn't work, maybe the correct command is "cook the pork chop on the stove". Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the stove's name. Let me check the previous steps again. The user is in the kitchen, and the stove is present. So the next action should be to cook the pork chop on the stove. But the game might require the exact phrase. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the verb "sear" instead of "fry". But the recipe says "fry", so that's not helpful.

Another possibility is that the user needs to use the stove's function. So after putting the pork chop on the stove, they need to turn it on or use it. But the game might not have a "turn on" command. Alternatively, maybe the correct action is to "fry the pork chop" without specifying the stove, but the game didn't recognize it. So maybe the correct command is "cook the pork chop". Let me try that.

So far, they've taken the pork chop, red onion, and knife. They chopped the pork chop and put it on the stove. Then they tried to cook it but got a prompt asking what to cook it with.

The issue here is that the game is expecting a specific action. The user tried "cook pork chop" but the game responded with a question about what to cook it with. That suggests that the correct action is to use the stove to fry the pork chop. Since the user already has the pork chop on the stove, the next step is to use the stove's function to fry it. The correct command should be "fry the pork chop on the stove" or similar. But since previous attempts with "fry" didn't work, maybe the correct verb is "cook" with the stove. Alternatively, the user might need to use the knife to chop it again, but they already chopped it. Wait, the user has the pork chop on the stove, so the next step is to cook it.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe. The recipe requires chopping and frying the pork chop and red onion. So far, they've successfully chopped both ingredients and fried them using the stove. The next step in the recipe is to "prepare the meal," which probably means combining the cooked ingredients.

The user has already completed the steps for the pork chop and red onion. The next action should be to put them together to make the meal. Since the game hasn't mentioned any other steps, the final step is to prepare the meal by combining the fried pork chop and red onion. The correct command here would be "prepare the meal" or "serve the meal." But since the recipe says "prepare meal," maybe that's the exact phrase needed. Alternatively, the user might need to use the stove again, but since both ingredients are already cooked, the final step is to assemble them. So the next action is to prepare the meal.

Something still needs to be cut.

cut red onion
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

You need to specify how you want to cut the red onion. Either slice, dice, or chop it.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe. The recipe says to dice the red onion. But earlier, they tried cutting it and were asked to specify slice, dice, or chop. So the correct action here is to dice the red onion. Since the user hasn't done that yet, the next step is to dice it. The previous steps were chopping the pork chop and frying both. Now, the red onion needs to be diced. So the correct command is "dice the red onion".
