I am stoked to announce that you are now in the livingroom.

If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a sofa. You wonder idly who left that here. But the thing is empty. Hopefully, this discovery doesn't ruin your TextWorld experience!

You need an exit without a door? You should try going north.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in a text-based game. The goal is to cook a meal by finding a recipe in the kitchen. So far, they've moved from the living room, through the bedroom, corridor, bathroom, and back to the corridor again. The current room is the corridor with a closed sliding patio door east, exits north, south, and west. The user tried going west again, which led back to the bathroom.

Hmm, the user is stuck in a loop between the corridor and the bathroom. They need to find a way to get to the kitchen. The previous actions of going west and east are just repeating the same path. So, the next step should be to try a different direction. The corridor has an exit to the north, but the user hasn't tried that yet. Maybe going north from the corridor would lead them to the kitchen. Alternatively, if the patio door is closed, maybe they need to open it, but the game hasn't mentioned any way to open it yet. But since the user hasn't tried north yet, that's the next logical step. So the next action should be to go north.

Of every kitchen you could have sauntered into, you had to walk into an ordinary one.

Were you looking for a fridge? Because look over there, it's a fridge. You can see an oven. You can make out a table. You see a cookbook on the table. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You smell an intriguing smell, and follow it to a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You make out a stove! But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

There is a closed frosted-glass door leading west. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to cook a meal by following the recipe from the cookbook. They found the cookbook in the kitchen, so that's checked off. Now, they need to gather the ingredients: pork chop, red onion, and white tuna. 

Looking at the previous actions, the user tried taking the pork chop from the counter, but it wasn't there. The counter has a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato, and a knife. Wait, the recipe says pork chop, red onion, white tuna. The user might have missed looking for those specific items. 

The user is in the kitchen, so maybe the pork chop is in the fridge. The fridge is mentioned as being in the kitchen. The user hasn't checked the fridge yet. The previous steps were taking the cookbook, then looking at it. Now, the next step should be to check the fridge for the pork chop. 

But the user tried taking the pork chop from the counter and failed. So maybe the pork chop is in the fridge. The user needs to open the fridge, take the pork chop, then proceed to get the red onion and white tuna. The next action should be to go to the fridge, open it, and take the pork chop. But the current room is the kitchen, and the fridge is in the kitchen. Wait, the user is in the kitchen, and the fridge is mentioned as being there. So the next step is to go to the fridge, open it, and take the pork chop. But the user hasn't done that yet. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check the fridge for the pork chop. The previous action was taking the pork chop from the counter, which wasn't there. So the correct step is to check the fridge. The user should go to the fridge, open it, and take the pork chop. Then proceed to get the red onion and white tuna. So the next action is to go to the fridge, which is in the kitchen. But the user is already in the kitchen. Wait, the fridge is in the kitchen, so the user is already there. The next step is to open the fridge. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action should be to open the fridge. But the user's last action was taking the cookbook. So the next step is to go to the fridge, open it, and take the pork chop. But the user can't see the pork chop on the counter, so it's probably in the fridge. Therefore, the correct next action is to open the fridge. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the answer is to open the fridge.

Looking at the previous actions, the user took the cookbook, found the ingredients, and now has all three items. The recipe says to dice the pork chop, grill it, dice the red onion, roast it, dice the white tuna, grill it, and then prepare the meal. The user has the ingredients but hasn't started cooking yet.

The next logical step is to begin preparing the dish according to the recipe. Since the user is in the kitchen, they should start by dicing the pork chop. The command would be "dice pork chop". That's the first step in the recipe, so that's the next action needed to complete the meal and win the game.

The user tried to dice the pork chop but got a message asking what they want to dice it with. They tried "use knife on pork chop", but that didn't work. So maybe the knife is already in their inventory from earlier. Wait, in the kitchen, there's a knife on the counter. The user might need to take the knife first before using it on the pork chop.

So the previous action was trying to use the knife on the pork chop without taking it. The correct step would be to take the knife first. Then, use the knife to dice the pork chop. That makes sense because the knife is on the counter, so they need to pick it up before using it. Therefore, the next action should be to take the knife.

Okay, let's see. The user's goal is to cook a meal by following the recipe. They've already taken the cookbook, gathered all the ingredients, and started preparing the pork chop. The next steps according to the recipe are to grill the pork chop, dice the red onion, roast the red onion, dice the white tuna, grill the white tuna, and then prepare the meal.

The user just diced the pork chop, so the next step is to grill it. But how do they grill it? The recipe says "grill the pork chop," so maybe they need to use the grill. But in the kitchen, there's a stove, but the user hasn't mentioned a grill. Wait, the recipe might assume the user knows how to use the available tools. Since the user is in the kitchen, maybe they can use the stove's grill function. Alternatively, the user might need to use the stove itself. But the previous action was dicing, so the next logical step is to grill the pork chop. The command would be "grill pork chop." But the system might expect a different verb. Alternatively, maybe "put pork chop on stove" or "cook pork chop." But the recipe says "grill," so the correct action is to grill it. The user tried "use knife on pork chop" before, which didn't work, but now they've diced it. So the next step is to grill the pork chop. The command should be "grill pork chop."

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe. They've already gathered all the ingredients and diced the pork chop. The next step in the recipe is to grill the pork chop. But the user is having trouble with the commands. They tried "grill pork chop" which didn't work, then "cook pork chop" which asked what they want to cook it with. Then they tried "use stove on pork chop" but that wasn't recognized.

So, maybe the correct action is to use the stove to cook the pork chop. The recipe says "grill the pork chop," but the system might expect a different command. Since the user is in the kitchen and the stove is present, the next step is to put the pork chop on the stove and cook it. The command should be "put pork chop on stove" or "cook pork chop on stove." But the system might not recognize "put," so maybe "cook pork chop" with the stove. Alternatively, since the user has the knife and the pork chop, they need to use the stove. The correct command is likely "cook pork chop" using the stove. But the system says "use stove on pork chop" isn't valid. So maybe the correct action is to use the stove to cook the pork chop. The next step is to cook the pork chop on the stove.
