-= Bedroom =-
You've just shown up in a bedroom. The room is well lit.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a bed. The bed is large. The bed appears to be empty.

There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.

You arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a green bell pepper, a green hot pepper, a red bell pepper and a yellow onion. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a tomato and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open plain door leading west. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe in the cookbook. The recipe says to chop the green bell pepper, roast it, and prepare the meal. But the user is having trouble getting the knife to work on the pepper.

First, they tried "chop green bell pepper," but the system said cutting requires a knife. Then they took the knife from the table. But when they tried "chop" again, it didn't work. Then they tried "use knife on green bell pepper," which wasn't recognized. So they kept repeating "chop" and "use knife," which isn't working.

Wait, maybe the correct action is to use the knife on the pepper. But the system doesn't recognize "use knife on" as a valid command. Maybe the correct verb is "cut" instead of "chop"? Or perhaps "chop" requires the knife to be used properly. Alternatively, maybe the system expects a different phrasing, like "cut the green bell pepper with the knife."

But the user has already taken the knife. So the next step should be to use the knife on the pepper. Since "use knife on" isn't working, maybe the correct command is "cut green bell pepper" after taking the knife. But the system said that "chop" requires a knife, but "cut" might be a different verb. Alternatively, maybe the correct action is "chop the green bell pepper with the knife," but the system might not recognize that.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to first "chop" the pepper, which requires the knife, and then "roast" it. But the user is stuck on the first step. So the next action should be to use the knife on the pepper, even if the system doesn't recognize it, but maybe the correct command is "cut" instead of "chop." Or maybe "chop" is the right verb, but the system is expecting the user to use the knife properly. Since the user has the knife, perhaps the correct command is "chop green bell pepper" again, but the system is not recognizing it. So the user needs to find a synonym or different phrasing. Maybe "cut" is the correct verb here. So the next action should be "cut green bell pepper" instead of "chop."

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to cook a meal using the recipe from the cookbook. The recipe requires chopping the green bell pepper, roasting it, and preparing the meal. So far, the user has found the cookbook, taken the knife, but is stuck on the first step of chopping the pepper.

The user has tried "chop green bell pepper" multiple times, but the system says cutting requires a knife. Then they tried "use knife on green bell pepper," which isn't recognized. The system keeps prompting for a specific cutting method (slice, dice, chop) but the user keeps using "chop."

So, the loop here is repeatedly trying "chop" without specifying the method. The system might expect a different verb or a different phrasing. Since "chop" is a verb, but the system is not recognizing "use knife on," maybe the correct action is to use the knife on the pepper with the right verb. Alternatively, maybe "cut" is the correct verb here. The user needs to use a synonym or different phrasing to break the loop. The next step should be to use the knife on the pepper with the correct verb, perhaps "cut" instead of "chop."

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe. The recipe says to chop the green bell pepper, roast it, and prepare the meal. But the user is stuck on the first step.

They've tried "chop green bell pepper" multiple times, but the system says cutting requires a knife. Then they took the knife from the table. But when they tried "chop" again, it didn't work. Then they tried "use knife on green bell pepper," which wasn't recognized. So they kept repeating "chop" and "use knife," which isn't working.

Wait, maybe the correct action is to use the knife on the pepper. The system might not recognize "use knife on" but maybe "cut" is the right verb. The user has the knife, so maybe the correct command is "cut green bell pepper with knife." But the system keeps saying it only understood up to cutting. So maybe the user needs to specify the tool again. Alternatively, maybe the system expects a different phrasing, like "chop the green bell pepper with the knife." But the user has tried that. Hmm.

The loop here is repeatedly trying to chop the pepper without specifying the method. The system might expect a different verb or a different phrasing. The next step should be to use the knife on the pepper with the correct verb, perhaps "cut" instead of "chop." So the next action should be "cut green bell pepper with knife."

Okay, let's tackle this. The user is stuck in a loop where they keep trying to cut the green bell pepper with the knife, but the system isn't recognizing it. The goal is to follow the recipe: chop the pepper, roast it, then prepare the meal.

First, the user has already taken the knife from the table. The problem is the command structure. The system might not accept "cut green bell pepper with knife" as valid. Maybe the correct verb is "chop" instead of "cut," but the user has tried that. Alternatively, the system might expect the knife to be used in a specific way.

Since the user is repeating the same action and getting the same response, they need to try a different phrasing. Maybe "use the knife to chop the green bell pepper" or "chop the green bell pepper with the knife." But the system keeps saying it only understands up to cutting. So perhaps the next step is to use the knife on the pepper without specifying the action, just "use knife on green bell pepper," but that didn't work before. Alternatively, maybe the system expects the user to first "chop" the pepper, which requires the knife, and then "roast" it. But the user is stuck on the first step.

The loop is trying the same command over and over. The solution is to find a synonym or different phrasing. Since "cut" isn't working, maybe "slice" or "dice" as alternatives. But the recipe says "chop," so maybe that's the correct verb. The user needs to use the knife properly. The next action should be to use the knife on the pepper with the correct verb, perhaps "chop" again, but the system isn't recognizing it. So the answer is to try a different command, like "chop the green bell pepper with the knife."

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe. They've already chopped the green bell pepper. The next step in the recipe is to roast it. But the user is having trouble with the verb "roast." They've tried "roast green bell pepper with oven" and "roast green bell pepper in oven," but the system isn't recognizing those as valid commands.

So, the goal is to follow the recipe: chop the pepper, roast it, then prepare the meal. The user has completed the first step (chopping). Now, they need to roast it. The problem is the correct verb or phrasing for roasting. Maybe the system expects a different verb, like "bake" instead of "roast," or "put in oven." Alternatively, maybe "roast" is the correct verb, but the user needs to specify using the oven. Since the previous attempts with "roast" and "with oven" didn't work, perhaps the correct command is "put green bell pepper in oven" or "place in oven." But the recipe says "roast," so maybe the user needs to use the correct verb. The next step is to find the right command for roasting, possibly using the oven. The user should try a different phrasing, like "roast the green bell pepper in the oven" or "put the green bell pepper in the oven to roast." But since the system isn't recognizing "roast," maybe the answer is to use "bake" instead. However, the recipe specifies "roast," so the user needs to stick with that. The correct command might be "roast green bell pepper in oven" without the verb "with." But the system says that's not a verb. So the next action should be to use the oven properly, maybe "put in oven" as the verb. But the recipe says "roast," so the user needs to find the right command. The answer is to use "roast" with the correct object and possibly the oven.

FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is trying to follow a recipe to cook a meal. The recipe says to chop the green bell pepper, roast it, and then prepare the meal. So far, the user has successfully chopped the pepper. Now, they need to roast it.

The problem is that the user is trying to use the verb "roast" but the system isn't recognizing it. They've tried "roast green bell pepper with oven" and "roast green bell pepper in oven," but both are invalid. The system keeps saying "That's not a verb I recognise."

So, the user is stuck on the second step of the recipe. They need to find the correct way to roast the pepper. Since "roast" isn't working, maybe the correct verb is "bake" or "put in oven." But the recipe specifies "roast," so maybe the user needs to use the correct phrasing. Alternatively, the system might expect the user to use the oven's action, like "put in oven" instead of "roast."

The loop here is repeatedly trying to use "roast" with the oven, which isn't working. The solution is to find a synonym or different phrasing. Since "roast" isn't recognized, maybe the correct action is "put the green bell pepper in the oven" or "place in oven." But the recipe says "roast," so the user needs to stick with that. The next step is to try a different command that the system might recognize, like "put in oven" instead of "roast."

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to roast the green bell pepper. They put it in the oven, but the system isn't recognizing "roast" as a verb. The previous attempts to use "roast" with different phrases didn't work. The user needs to find another way to make the system understand that the pepper is being roasted.

The goal is to follow the recipe: chop, roast, prepare. The user has chopped and put the pepper in the oven. Now, they need to roast it. Since "roast" isn't working, maybe the correct action is to use the oven's function. The oven is open, so maybe the user needs to "heat" the pepper in the oven. Alternatively, the system might expect the user to say " bake" instead of "roast." But the recipe says "roast," so maybe the user needs to use the correct verb. The next step is to try a different command that the system recognizes, like "heat" or "bake."
