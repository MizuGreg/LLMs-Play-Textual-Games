Hey, want to see a toilet? Look over there, a toilet. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the toilet.

You need an exit without a door? You should try going north.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Bathroom and Corridor. They keep going north and south, which just brings them back. The goal is to cook a meal by finding a recipe in the kitchen.

First, I need to figure out how to get to the kitchen. The current path is looping, so maybe there's another way. The user has been going back and forth between the bathroom and corridor. The bathroom has a toilet but nothing else. The corridor has east and south exits, but going south just brings them back to the bathroom.

Wait, maybe the kitchen is in a different direction. The initial prompt mentioned the kitchen has a cookbook. The user hasn't checked other rooms yet. Maybe they need to explore east instead of south. But in the corridor, the advice was to go east or south. The user kept going south, which loops. Maybe trying east first would lead to the kitchen.

So the next step is to go east from the corridor. That's the next action. The user needs to break the loop by trying a different direction. The previous actions were all south and north, which are looping. Changing to east might lead to the kitchen where the cookbook is.

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. An usual one.

You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop, a white onion, a red bell pepper and a carrot. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a closed oven. You smell an intriguing smell, and follow it to a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. You can make out a counter. On the counter you can make out a banana. Hey, want to see a stove? Look over there, a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.

There is an open frosted-glass door leading east. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one. There is an exit to the west.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to cook a meal using the cookbook in the kitchen. They've already taken the cookbook and tried to prepare a recipe, but they're stuck on the banana. The recipe says to dice the banana, but they need a knife and are having trouble executing the action.

Looking at the previous steps, the user tried cutting the banana with a knife but got errors. The system mentioned that they need to take the banana first. So the issue is that the banana is still on the table, and they need to pick it up before using it.

The next logical step is to take the banana from the counter. Once they have it, they can use the knife to dice it. Then, after dicing, they can roast it as per the recipe. But since the user is stuck on the cutting part, the immediate action should be to take the banana. That's the missing step before they can proceed with cutting.

SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to roast the banana but the system isn't recognizing "roast" as a verb. They've already diced the banana with the knife. The recipe says to roast the banana after dicing. But the user is stuck on the "roast" command.

Hmm, maybe the correct verb is "put on stove" or "place on stove". Since the stove is in the room, they need to put the diced banana on the stove. The previous attempts to use "roast" are failing, so the next step should be to place the banana on the stove. That makes sense because the recipe says to roast it, but the action might be "put on stove" instead of "roast". So the next action should be to put the diced banana on the stove.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to roast a banana but keeps getting errors. The goal is to cook a meal using the recipe from the cookbook. They've already taken the cookbook, diced the banana with the knife, and put the banana on the stove. But the system isn't recognizing "roast" as a verb.

Wait, maybe the correct action is to "place the banana on the stove" instead of "roast". But the user tried that and got an error. Alternatively, maybe the stove is already on, so they just need to put the banana on it. The previous steps show that the user put the banana on the stove, but the system isn't accepting "roast". So the next step should be to use the stove's function. Since "roast" isn't working, maybe the correct verb is "heat" or "cook". But the recipe says "roast", so perhaps the system expects a different command. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the oven instead of the stove. But the oven is closed. Hmm. The user is stuck in a loop between taking and putting the banana on the stove. The key is to find the correct verb that the system accepts. Since "roast" isn't working, maybe "cook" is the right term. But the recipe says "roast". Alternatively, maybe the action is just putting it on the stove, and the roasting is automatic. But the system is strict. The user needs to find a synonym for "roast" that works. Alternatively, maybe the correct action is to "put the banana in the oven", but the oven is closed. Wait, the user has the cookbook and the recipe says to roast the banana. The stove is conventional and empty. Maybe the correct action is to use the stove's function. Since "roast" isn't working, perhaps the correct command is "heat" or "cook". But the system might not recognize those. Alternatively, the user might need to use the oven. But the oven is closed. The user needs to open the oven first. Wait, the user hasn't tried that. So maybe the next step is to open the oven, then put the banana in. But the recipe says to roast on the stove. This is confusing. The user is stuck in a loop, so the assistant needs to suggest a different action. The previous actions were taking and putting the banana on the stove. The system isn't recognizing "roast", so maybe the correct action is to "cook" the banana. But the system might not accept that. Alternatively, the user needs to use the oven. So the next step is to open the oven, then put the banana in. But the user hasn't tried that yet. So the correct action would be to open the oven.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal but keeps getting errors. The goal is to follow the recipe in the cookbook. They've taken the cookbook, got the ingredients, diced the banana, and tried to roast it. But the system isn't recognizing "roast" as a verb.

First, the steps needed are: take the cookbook, get ingredients, dice the banana, roast it. The user has done the first three steps. Now, they need to roast the banana. But the system says "roast" isn't a verb. Maybe the correct action is to use the stove's function. The user put the banana on the stove, but the system doesn't accept "roast". Alternatively, the user needs to use the oven. They tried that but the system still doesn't recognize the verb. The user is stuck in a loop between taking and putting the banana on the stove. The key is to find the correct verb. Since "roast" isn't working, maybe the answer is to use "cook" even if it's not recognized. But the system says it's not a verb. The correct action is to use the oven and accept that "roast" isn't working, so the next step is to "cook" the banana in the oven.

But the system isn't recognizing "roast" as a verb. The user is stuck in a loop between taking and putting the banana on the stove.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal but keeps getting errors. The goal is to follow the recipe in the cookbook. They've taken the cookbook, got the ingredients, diced the banana, and tried to roast it. But the system isn't recognizing "roast" as a verb. The user is stuck in a loop between taking and putting the banana on the stove.

First, the steps needed are: take the cookbook, get ingredients, dice the banana, roast it. The user has done the first three steps. Now, they need to roast the banana. The system says "roast" isn't a verb. Maybe the correct action is to use the stove's function. The user put the banana on the stove, but the system doesn't accept "roast". Alternatively, the user needs to use the oven. They tried that but the system still doesn't recognize the verb. The key is to find the correct verb. Since "roast" isn't working, maybe the answer is to use "cook" even if it's not recognized. But the system says it's not a verb. The correct action is to use the oven and accept that "roast" isn't working, so the next step is to "cook" the banana in the oven.
