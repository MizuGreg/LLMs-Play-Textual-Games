You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Livingroom =-
You find yourself in a livingroom. A typical kind of place.

You can make out a sofa! But the thing is empty. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door.

-= Kitchen =-
You're now in a kitchen. Let's see what's in here.

An open fridge is right there by you. The fridge contains a carrot and a lettuce. You can see a closed oven. You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a yellow apple, a raw yellow potato and a red apple. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

There is an open plain door leading east. There is an exit to the north. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the cookbook in the kitchen. The goal is to follow the recipe steps to prepare a dish.

So far, the user has gone from the living room to the kitchen, opened the oven (though it was already open), took the cookbook and the knife. They checked the oven but it was empty. Now they're stuck because looking in the oven again doesn't yield anything new. The oven is empty, so maybe they need to find ingredients or follow the recipe steps.

Wait, the fridge has a carrot and lettuce, and the counter has apples and a potato. The cookbook probably has a recipe that uses these items. The user needs to use the knife to prepare the ingredients. Since the oven is empty, maybe they need to put the ingredients into the oven. But the stove is mentioned as being conventional but having nothing on it. Maybe the recipe requires using the stove instead of the oven? Or perhaps the oven is supposed to be used after cooking on the stove.

But the user has already taken the knife and the cookbook. The next step would be to check the recipe in the cookbook for the ingredients needed. The user might need to follow the steps in the cookbook to cook the meal. Since the oven is empty, maybe they need to put the ingredients into the oven. However, the user hasn't used the ingredients yet. They have the carrot, lettuce, apples, and potato from the fridge and counter. The knife is taken, so they can cut the ingredients. The recipe might require cooking these items in the oven. But the oven is empty, so maybe they need to put the ingredients in and then bake them. However, the user hasn't done that yet. The previous actions were taking items and checking the oven, but the oven is empty. So the next step would be to use the ingredients from the fridge and counter, prepare them with the knife, and then put them in the oven. But the user hasn't done that yet. The user is stuck because they keep checking the oven, which is empty. So maybe they need to find the recipe steps in the cookbook and follow them. The next action should be to check the cookbook for the recipe steps. But the user already took the cookbook. So maybe they need to read the recipe, find the ingredients, and then cook them. Since the oven is empty, perhaps the user needs to put the ingredients into the oven. But the user hasn't done that yet. The previous actions didn't progress because they kept checking the oven. So the next step is to use the ingredients and the knife to prepare the meal according to the recipe. The user needs to follow the steps in the cookbook. So the next action should be to check the cookbook's recipe steps. But the user already took the cookbook. So maybe the next step is to look at the cookbook to find the recipe instructions. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the ingredients and the knife to cook something, then put it in the oven. But the oven is empty. So the user needs to put the prepared ingredients into the oven. However, the user hasn't done that yet. The previous actions were taking the cookbook and knife, checking the oven. Now, the user needs to use the ingredients from the fridge and counter, prepare them, and then put them in the oven. The next action should be to use the ingredients and the knife to prepare the meal, then put it in the oven. But the user hasn't done that yet. The user is stuck in a loop of checking the oven. So the next action should be to follow the recipe steps in the cookbook to cook the meal.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to cook a meal using the cookbook in the kitchen. They've already gathered ingredients like carrot, yellow apple, and have a knife. The recipe requires dicing the carrot, frying it, slicing the apple, roasting the apple, and preparing the meal.

Earlier attempts to use the knife on the carrot resulted in errors because the user tried using "dice" and "fry" as verbs, which weren't recognized. The correct approach is to use the knife to cut the carrot into dice. Since "use knife on carrot" wasn't working, maybe the correct command is "cut carrot with knife" or "dice carrot with knife". But the system might expect a different phrasing. Alternatively, maybe "fry carrot" is supposed to be done on the stove, not the oven. The user might need to use the stove instead of the oven for frying. So the next step is to use the knife to dice the carrot, then use the stove to fry it. The previous actions kept repeating the same commands, leading to a loop. The next action should be to properly dice the carrot using the knife, then proceed to fry it on the stove.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to cook a meal using the recipe from the cookbook. They've already followed the steps: diced the carrot, fried it on the stove, sliced the yellow apple. Now the next step is to roast the yellow apple. The previous attempt to "roast yellow apple on stove" didn't work because "roast" wasn't recognized as a verb. So, maybe the correct command is "cook yellow apple on stove" or "bake yellow apple on stove". Since the stove is conventional, using "cook" might be the right synonym. The user needs to use the stove to cook the sliced apple. The next action should be to cook the apple on the stove.
