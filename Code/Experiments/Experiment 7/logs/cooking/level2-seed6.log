You've just sauntered into a kitchen. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."

You can see a fridge. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. What a letdown! The fridge is empty! You see a closed oven, which looks conventional, in the corner. Were you looking for a table? Because look over there, it's a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a yellow apple, a red apple, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper and a cookbook. You can see a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe in the cookbook. The recipe requires chopping and frying both a red apple and a yellow apple. The problem is that the user is having trouble getting the knife to chop the apple. They tried "chop red apple" but the system says it requires a knife. Then they tried "use knife on red apple" but that's not a recognized verb. They keep repeating the same actions, which is causing a loop.

First, I need to recall the goal: follow the recipe steps. The user has already looked at the cookbook and found the recipe. They need to chop both apples. The issue is that the correct action might be using the knife to chop the apple, but the previous attempts didn't work because the verbs weren't recognized.

Looking at the previous interactions, the user tried "chop red apple" which failed because a knife is needed. Then they tried "use knife on red apple" which was rejected. The system might be expecting a different verb structure. Maybe "cut" instead of "chop"? Or perhaps "chop" is the correct verb, but the user needs to use the knife properly.

Wait, the error messages indicate that "use knife on red apple" isn't a verb. Maybe the correct command is "chop red apple with knife" or "cut red apple with knife". Alternatively, the system might require a different phrasing. Since "chop" is the verb in the recipe, but the system is not recognizing it when used with the knife, perhaps the user needs to use the knife to chop the apple directly.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to first take the knife, then use it on the apple. But the user already has the knife on the counter. So the next step is to use the knife to chop the red apple. The previous attempts used "use knife on red apple" which was rejected. Maybe the correct command is "chop red apple with knife" or "cut red apple with knife". But the system might not recognize "cut" as a valid verb here. Alternatively, maybe the correct verb is "chop" without specifying the knife, but the system requires the knife to be used.

Since the user is stuck in a loop, the next step is to try a different phrasing. Instead of "use knife on red apple", maybe "chop red apple with knife" or "cut red apple with knife". But the system might not accept "cut". Alternatively, the user might need to use the knife to chop the apple directly. The correct action is probably "chop red apple with knife", but the system might not recognize that. Alternatively, the user might need to use the knife to chop the apple, so the command is "use knife to chop red apple".

But the system says "That's not a verb I recognise." So maybe the correct verb is "chop" without the knife, but the system requires the knife. Therefore, the user needs to use the knife to chop the apple. The correct command is "chop red apple with knife", but if that's not working, maybe "cut red apple with knife". However, the recipe says "chop", so maybe the system is expecting "chop" with the knife. The user has tried "chop red apple" which failed because a knife is needed, then "use knife on red apple" which failed. The next step is to try "chop red apple with knife" or "cut red apple with knife". Since the system is not recognizing "use knife on", maybe the correct command is "chop red apple with knife".

Okay, let's break this down. The user needs to follow the recipe from the cookbook to cook a meal. The recipe says to chop and fry both a red and yellow apple. So far, the user has chopped both apples using the knife. Now, the next step is to fry them.

The user tried "fry red apple" but got an error. Then they tried "fry red apple with pan" and "fry red apple with stove", both not recognized. The problem is that "fry" might not be the correct verb here. Maybe the correct action is to use the stove to cook the apples. Since the stove is in the kitchen, perhaps the command should be "cook red apple on stove" or "fry red apple with stove". But the system didn't recognize "with stove" as a verb. Alternatively, maybe "put red apple on stove" and then "cook". But the recipe says "fry", so maybe the correct verb is "fry" with the stove. Since previous attempts failed, maybe the user needs to use a different phrasing, like "cook red apple on stove" instead of "fry". Alternatively, "heat stove" first, then put the apple on it. But the recipe specifies "fry", so perhaps the correct command is "fry red apple on stove". Let's try that.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe. They've already chopped both apples and fried them on the stove. The next step was to "prepare meal", which worked. Now, the user is at the final step where they need to enjoy the meal. The system says "Enjoy your meal!" but the user tried "finish meal" which wasn't recognized. The goal is to complete the cooking process and enjoy the meal.

So far, the user has completed all the recipe steps: chopping and frying both apples, then preparing the meal. The last action was "prepare meal", which added the meal to their inventory. The next step should be to enjoy the meal. Since "finish meal" didn't work, maybe the correct command is "eat meal" or "consume meal". Alternatively, since the system accepted "prepare meal", maybe the final step is just to confirm that the meal is ready. But the user is stuck on the last command. The correct action here is to use a synonym for "enjoy", like "eat" or "consume". The system might expect "eat meal" as the next step.
