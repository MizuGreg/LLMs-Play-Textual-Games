You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. A normal one.

You can see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper, a raw white tuna, a yellow onion, a red bell pepper, a lettuce and a white onion. You can make out an oven. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You make out a table. Now why would someone leave that there? You see a knife on the table. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw red potato, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a raw red tuna, a red hot pepper and a cookbook. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe in the cookbook. The recipe requires dicing the pork chop, roasting it, slicing and frying two types of potatoes, then preparing the meal.

So far, the user has checked the cookbook, found the recipe, taken the knife, and tried to dice the pork chop. But there's an error because the system says "Cutting something requires a knife," but the user already has the knife. Wait, maybe the action "dice the pork chop" isn't recognized because the system expects a different verb or command. The user tried "dice" but maybe the correct action is "cut" instead? Or perhaps the system is expecting a different phrasing.

The user is stuck in a loop where they keep getting the same error. The previous actions were: check cookbook, take knife, try to dice again. The system isn't recognizing "dice" as a valid action. So the next step is to find an alternative way to cut the pork chop. Maybe using the word "cut" instead of "dice"? Or perhaps the system needs the user to use the knife first, then perform the action.

Wait, the user has the knife. So maybe the correct action is "cut the pork chop" instead of "dice". Let me check the recipe again. The recipe says "dice the pork chop", but maybe the system expects the user to use the knife to cut it. So the user needs to use the knife to cut the pork chop. So the next action should be "cut the pork chop with the knife" or just "cut the pork chop". Since the user already has the knife, maybe the correct command is "cut the pork chop".
