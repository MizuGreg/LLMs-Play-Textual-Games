You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. A normal one.

You make out a fridge. The fridge contains a red onion, a raw pork chop, a red bell pepper, a yellow onion, a carrot, a lettuce and an orange bell pepper. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's an oven. You wonder idly who left that here. You scan the room, seeing a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to a stove. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let me try to figure out what to do next. The goal is to cook a meal using the ingredients from the cookbook. So far, I've taken the pork chop and the red onion. The recipe says to chop the pork chop and fry it, then dice the red onion and fry it. But I'm stuck on how to chop the pork chop because I can't use the knife properly.

Wait, maybe I need to use the knife on the pork chop. The previous attempts to use the knife didn't work. Maybe the correct command is to chop the pork chop with the knife. Let me check the recipe again. The directions say "chop the pork chop" and "dice the red onion". So maybe I need to use the knife to chop the pork chop. But the system didn't recognize "use knife to chop pork chop". Maybe the correct verb is "chop" instead of "use". Let me try "chop pork chop with knife" or "chop pork chop". But the system said "What do you want to chop the pork chop with?" so I need to specify the tool. Maybe the correct command is "chop pork chop with knife". But the system might not accept that. Alternatively, maybe I should first use the knife on the pork chop to chop it. But the system said "You can't see any such thing." Maybe the knife is on the table, so I need to take the knife first. Wait, I already took the pork chop and red onion. The knife is on the table. So I need to take the knife, then use it to chop the pork chop. Let me try that. Take the knife from the table, then use it to chop the pork chop. Then proceed to dice the onion. That should be the next steps.

Okay, let me try to figure this out. The goal is to cook a meal according to the recipe. So far, I've gathered the pork chop and red onion, chopped them, and diced the onion. The next steps are to fry both ingredients. But the system isn't recognizing "fry" commands. Maybe the correct verb is "cook" instead of "fry"? Or perhaps I need to use the stove. Wait, the recipe says to fry, but maybe the action is "cook in pan" or "saute". Let me check the available actions. The user tried "fry pork chop in pan" but it didn't work. Maybe the correct command is "cook pork chop in pan" or "saute pork chop". Alternatively, maybe the stove is the correct tool. Since the user is in the kitchen, maybe the action is "put pork chop in pan" and then "cook". But the recipe says to fry, so perhaps the correct verb is "fry" but with a different phrasing. Alternatively, maybe the system expects "heat pan" first. Let me think: the user needs to fry the pork chop and red onion. Since "fry" isn't working, maybe the correct action is "cook" or "heat". But the recipe specifies frying. Maybe the correct command is "fry pork chop" without specifying the pan, but the system requires the pan. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the stove. Wait, the user is at the table, but the stove is in the kitchen. Maybe the correct action is to go to the stove first. But the user is already in the kitchen. Hmm. The previous attempt was "fry red onion in pan", which didn't work. Maybe the correct command is "cook red onion in pan". Alternatively, "heat pan" to cook. But the recipe says to fry. Maybe the correct action is "fry pork chop" without the pan, but the system requires the pan. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the stove. Let me try "cook pork chop in stove" or "fry pork chop on stove". But the system might not recognize that. Alternatively, maybe the correct verb is "saute". Let me try "saute pork chop in pan". If that doesn't work, maybe "cook pork chop in pan". But the user has to follow the recipe's directions. The recipe says "fry the pork chop" and "fry the red onion". So the correct action is "fry" but with the pan. Maybe the correct command is "fry pork chop in pan" but the system doesn't recognize it. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the stove. Wait, the user is at the table, but the stove is in the kitchen. Maybe the correct action is to go to the stove first. But the user is already in the kitchen. Maybe the correct command is "use stove to fry pork chop". But the system might not recognize that. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the pan. But the pan isn't mentioned. Wait, the user has a knife and the ingredients. Maybe the correct action is "fry pork chop" without the pan, but the system requires the pan. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the stove. Let me try "fry pork chop on stove". If that doesn't work, maybe "cook pork chop in pan". But the system is not recognizing "fry". So maybe the correct action is "cook pork chop in pan". Let me try that.

Okay, let's break this down. The goal is to cook a meal using the recipe from the cookbook. So far, I've gathered the pork chop and red onion, chopped the pork chop, diced the red onion, and fried the pork chop in the stove. Now, the next step is to fry the red onion. But the user tried "fry red onion in stove" and it didn't work. The system didn't recognize "fry" again. Maybe the correct verb is "cook" instead of "fry". Alternatively, maybe the action is "fry red onion in pan" but the system requires a different phrasing. Since the previous attempt with "fry" failed, perhaps using "cook" would work. Let me try "cook red onion in stove" or "fry red onion with stove". But the system might expect a different command. Alternatively, maybe the correct action is "fry red onion" without specifying the stove, but the system requires it. Since the user is at the stove, maybe "fry red onion" is sufficient. But the system said "That's not a verb I recognise." So perhaps the correct action is "cook red onion in stove". Let me try that.
