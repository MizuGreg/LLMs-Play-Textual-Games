You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
I am sorry to announce that you are now in the kitchen. Let's see what's in here.

You can see an opened fridge nearby. The fridge contains a green bell pepper, a block of cheese, a yellow onion, a raw white tuna, a green hot pepper, an orange bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a red onion, a raw red tuna, a red bell pepper and a carrot. You can make out an oven. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a table. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hopefully, this discovery doesn't ruin your TextWorld experience! You can make out a counter. On the counter you make out a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. Huh, weird. You scan the room, seeing a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.

THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe in the cookbook. The recipe requires dicing the block of cheese, frying it, and other steps. But the user is having trouble with the command "dice the block of cheese" because the system says that's not a recognized verb.

Wait, the user tried "use knife on block of cheese" but that's not working either. The system keeps saying "That's not a verb I recognise." So maybe the correct command is different. Let me check the recipe again. The directions say "dice the block of cheese" and "fry the block of cheese". But the user can't use "dice" as a verb here. Maybe the correct action is to cut the cheese with the knife instead of dicing? Or perhaps the system expects a different phrasing, like "cut the block of cheese" instead of "dice".

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to first use the knife on the cheese to cut it, then proceed. But the system is not recognizing "dice" as a verb. So perhaps the correct action is to "cut the block of cheese" using the knife. Let me try that. The previous attempt was "dice the block of cheese", which didn't work. So changing "dice" to "cut" might be the solution. Then, after cutting, the next step would be to fry it. But the user needs to make sure they're using the correct verbs that the system accepts.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is trying to follow a recipe to cook a meal. The recipe requires dicing the block of cheese, frying it, and other steps. But the system isn't recognizing "dice" as a verb, so the user is stuck.

First, the goal is to complete the recipe by gathering ingredients and following directions. The user has already tried "dice the block of cheese" and "use knife on block of cheese," but both are not working. The system keeps saying "That's not a verb I recognise."

So, the user is in a loop because they're repeating the same actions. The problem is that "dice" isn't a recognized verb here. Maybe the correct action is to "cut" the cheese instead of "dice." The user tried "cut block of cheese with knife," but the system still doesn't accept it. Wait, maybe the correct command is just "cut the block of cheese" without mentioning the knife, or perhaps "slice" instead of "cut." Alternatively, the system might expect the user to use the knife first, then perform the action.

But the user has already tried "use knife on block of cheese" and it didn't work. The system might be expecting a different phrasing. Maybe the correct action is "cut the block of cheese" without the knife part. Or perhaps the user needs to "dice" the cheese using the knife, but the system doesn't recognize "dice" as a verb. 

In this case, the user needs to find a synonym for "dice" that the system accepts. Since "dice" isn't working, maybe "chop" or "slice" is the correct verb. Alternatively, the system might require the user to first use the knife on the cheese to cut it, then proceed. But the previous attempt with "cut block of cheese with knife" wasn't successful. 

The next step would be to try a different verb, like "chop" the block of cheese. If that doesn't work, maybe "slice" or "cut" without the knife. But since the user is in a loop, they need to break it by using a different action. The correct next step is to use a synonym for "dice" that the system recognizes, such as "chop."

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a recipe to cook a meal. The recipe requires dicing the block of cheese, frying it, and other steps. But the system isn't recognizing "dice" as a verb, so the user is stuck.

First, the goal is to complete the recipe by gathering ingredients and following directions. The user has already tried "dice the block of cheese" and "use knife on block of cheese," but both are not working. The system keeps saying "That's not a verb I recognise."

So, the user is in a loop because they're repeating the same actions. The problem is that "dice" isn't a recognized verb here. Maybe the correct action is to "cut" the cheese instead of "dice." The user tried "cut block of cheese with knife," but the system still doesn't accept it. Wait, maybe the correct command is just "cut the block of cheese" without mentioning the knife, or perhaps "slice" instead of "cut." Alternatively, the system might expect the user to first use the knife on the cheese to cut it, then proceed. But the user has already tried that.

The next step would be to try a different verb, like "chop" the block of cheese. If that doesn't work, maybe "slice" or "cut" without the knife. But since the user is in a loop, they need to break it by using a different action. The correct next step is to use a synonym for "dice" that the system recognizes, such as "chop."
