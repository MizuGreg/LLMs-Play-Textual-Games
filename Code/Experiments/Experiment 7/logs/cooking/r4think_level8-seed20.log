You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

You arrive in a kitchen. A normal one. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You see a closed fridge. You can see a closed oven, which looks conventional, right there by you. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a knife. Hey, want to see a counter? Look over there, a counter. You see a banana and a cookbook on the counter. You can see a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is a closed frosted-glass door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe in the cookbook. The recipe requires a pork chop, banana, and white tuna. They already took the banana from the counter. Now they need the pork chop and white tuna.

The user tried to take the pork chop from the fridge but couldn't see it because the fridge was closed. Then they tried to look in the fridge but it's still closed. So the next step is to open the fridge to check if the pork chop is inside. If the fridge is closed, they can't access the ingredients inside. So the immediate action should be to open the fridge. Once open, they can check for the pork chop. If it's there, take it. If not, maybe check other places. But according to the recipe, the pork chop should be in the fridge. So opening the fridge is the next logical step.

Okay, let's break this down. The user needs to follow the recipe steps to cook the meal. So far, they've gathered all the ingredients: banana, pork chop, and white tuna. The next steps are to slice the banana, roast it, then slice and roast the pork chop, dice and roast the white tuna, then prepare the meal.

The user tried to slice the banana but was asked what tool to use. They have a knife on the table. So the mistake was not using the knife. The correct action should be to use the knife on the banana to slice it. Since the previous attempt to slice the banana failed because the knife wasn't used, the next step is to use the knife on the banana. That's the missing step here. So the next command should be "slice banana with knife" or similar. But the system might expect "use knife on banana" or "slice banana". Wait, the user tried "slice banana" and was prompted for the tool. So the correct action is to use the knife. Therefore, the next action is to use the knife on the banana.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to slice the banana but keeps having issues with the knife. They took the knife from the table but can't carry more things. So the problem is that they're already carrying the banana and the pork chop, maybe? Wait, the user took the banana and pork chop already. So when they took the knife, they can't carry it because they're already holding too much.

So the goal is to slice the banana. The user needs to use the knife on the banana. But since they can't take the knife because they're carrying too much, maybe they need to drop one of the items to take the knife. But the recipe requires all ingredients, so dropping might not be an option. Alternatively, maybe the knife is already in hand, but the system isn't recognizing it. Wait, the user tried to use the knife on the banana but was told they need to take the knife first. So perhaps the knife is on the table, and they need to take it before using it.

But the user is carrying the banana and pork chop, so taking the knife would make three items. The system says they can't carry more. So maybe the solution is to drop the pork chop to take the knife, then use it on the banana. But the recipe requires all ingredients, so dropping might not be allowed. Alternatively, maybe the user can use the knife without taking it, but the system requires taking it first.

Alternatively, maybe the user can use the knife on the banana without taking it, but the system is strict. So the next step is to take the knife, even if it means dropping something else. But the user can't carry more. So perhaps the correct action is to take the knife, even if it's overloading, because the recipe requires using the knife. So the next command is "take knife from table".

But the system says "roast banana" isn't a recognized verb. So maybe the correct action is to use the oven's function. Since the oven is open, perhaps the user needs to "cook" the banana in the oven. Alternatively, maybe "roast" is a verb here, but the system isn't recognizing it. The previous action was putting the banana in the oven, so the next step should be to roast it. But since "roast" isn't working, maybe the synonym is "cook" or "heat". The user should try "cook banana in oven" or similar. But the system might expect "roast" even if it's not recognized. Alternatively, maybe the oven has a specific command. Since the user put the banana in the oven, the next step is to roast it, so the command should be "roast banana".

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook the meal according to the recipe. They've gathered all the ingredients: banana, pork chop, and white tuna. They sliced the banana, put it in the oven, took it out. Now they need to roast the banana. But the system isn't recognizing "roast" as a verb. Previous attempts to use "roast" failed, so maybe the correct action is to use "cook" instead. But when they tried "cook banana in oven", they had to take the banana first. Since the banana is already out of the oven, maybe they need to put it back in and then cook it. Alternatively, maybe the next step is to move to the next ingredient, like the pork chop. But the recipe says to roast the banana first. So the correct step is to cook the banana in the oven again. But the system says they need to take it first. Wait, maybe they need to put it back in the oven and then cook it. So the next action is to put the banana back in the oven and then cook it. But the user already took it out. So perhaps the correct command is "put banana in oven" again, then "cook banana". But the system might require a different phrasing. Alternatively, since the user is stuck, maybe they should proceed to the next step in the recipe, like slicing the pork chop. But the recipe requires roasting the banana first. So the next step is to cook the banana in the oven. The correct command is "cook banana in oven".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the recipe steps. They've already roasted the banana. Now they need to roast the pork chop. But when they tried "roast pork chop", the system said it's not a verb. Then they tried "cook pork chop in oven" but were told to take the pork chop first. They checked the fridge again and found a white onion and red tuna, but the pork chop was already taken earlier. Wait, the user took the pork chop from the fridge earlier, but maybe it's not in their inventory. So they need to take it again. But the system says they can't see it. Maybe the pork chop is in the fridge, so they need to open the fridge again. Wait, the fridge was opened earlier, and the pork chop was there. But when they tried to take it, they couldn't see it. Maybe the correct action is to take the pork chop from the fridge again. Alternatively, maybe the pork chop is already in their inventory, but they need to use it. So the next step is to take the pork chop from the fridge, then cook it in the oven. But the system says they can't see it, so they need to check the fridge again.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.
