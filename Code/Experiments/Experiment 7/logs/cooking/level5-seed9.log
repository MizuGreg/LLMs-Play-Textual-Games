You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one. There is an exit to the north. There is an exit to the south.

You see a toilet. However, the toilet, like an empty toilet, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.

You arrive in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.

Were you looking for a fridge? Because look over there, it's a fridge. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, a red bell pepper, an orange bell pepper and a block of cheese. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see an oven. You can make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a green apple, a raw purple potato, a green bell pepper, a yellow apple, a raw red potato and a green hot pepper. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Sometimes, just sometimes, TextWorld can just be the worst.

There is an open plain door leading north. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe in the cookbook. The recipe requires slicing the green apple and roasting it, along with dicing and roasting the purple potato.

So far, the user has taken the green apple and the purple potato. They also picked up the knife. The next step was trying to slice the green apple, but they forgot to use the knife first. Now that they've taken the knife, they need to slice the apple with it. The error was trying to slice without using the knife, which wasn't recognized. Now, using the knife on the apple should work. Then, after slicing, they need to roast the apple. But the user might not have a roasting method yet. Wait, the stove is there. Maybe they need to put the sliced apple on the stove. But the recipe says "roast the green apple," so maybe using the stove's heat. But in the game, the action might be "roast" followed by the item. So after slicing, roast the apple. Then dice the potato with the knife, then roast it. Finally, prepare the meal. But the user is stuck on slicing the apple. The correct action now is to slice the green apple using the knife. The previous mistake was not using the knife in the command. So the next step is to slice the apple with the knife.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the recipe to cook a meal. The recipe requires slicing the green apple, roasting it, dicing the purple potato, roasting it, and then preparing the meal.

So far, the user has taken the green apple and purple potato, sliced the apple, diced the potato. But when trying to roast them, the game didn't recognize the verb. Then the user tried again, and it still didn't work. The error messages suggest that "roast" isn't a valid verb here. Maybe the correct action is to use the stove. The stove is in the kitchen, so perhaps the user needs to put the ingredients on the stove and then use the stove's heat. Alternatively, maybe "roast" is a valid action but requires the stove to be used. Since the user has the knife and the ingredients, the next step is to use the stove to roast the apple and potato. The previous attempts to use "roast" directly might not be correct. So the correct action would be to put the sliced apple and diced potato on the stove and then roast them. But the game might require specific commands. Since "roast" isn't working, maybe the user needs to use the stove first. So the next action should be to use the stove to roast the apple and potato. Alternatively, maybe the correct verb is "cook" instead of "roast". But the recipe says "roast". Hmm. The user needs to find the right command that the game recognizes. Since "roast" isn't working, maybe the correct action is to use the stove to roast the apple and potato. So the next step is to roast the green apple on the stove and the purple potato on the stove. But the user has to specify the action correctly. The previous error was using "roast" without specifying the stove. So the correct command might be "roast green apple on stove" or similar. But the game might require a different phrasing. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to put the apple and potato on the stove first. So the next action is to put the sliced apple and diced potato on the stove, then roast them. But the user has to use the correct verbs. Since "roast" isn't working, maybe the correct action is to use the stove's heat. So the next step is to roast the apple and potato using the stove. The user should try "roast green apple" again, but the game might require the stove to be involved. Alternatively, maybe the correct action is "cook green apple" or "heat green apple". But the recipe says "roast". The user needs to find the right command that the game accepts. Since the previous attempt to roast didn't work, maybe the correct action is to use the stove to roast. So the next command is "roast green apple on stove" or similar. But the game might not recognize that. Alternatively, the user might need to use the stove first. So the next action is to use the stove, then roast the apple and potato. But the user has to use the correct verbs. The correct next step is to roast the apple and potato using the stove. So the command would be "roast green apple" and "roast purple potato", but since those didn't work, maybe the correct action is to use the stove. Therefore, the next action is to roast the apple and potato on the stove.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The user is trying to follow a recipe to cook a meal. The recipe requires slicing the green apple, roasting it, dicing the purple potato, roasting it, and then preparing the meal. 

So far, the user has taken the green apple and purple potato, sliced the apple, diced the potato. But when trying to roast them, the game isn't recognizing the verb "roast". The user has tried multiple times, and it's not working. The error messages suggest that "roast" isn't a valid action here. Maybe the correct action is to use the stove. The stove is in the kitchen, so perhaps the user needs to put the ingredients on the stove and then use the stove's heat. Alternatively, maybe the correct verb is "cook" instead of "roast". But the recipe says "roast".

The user is stuck in a loop where "roast" isn't recognized. The previous attempts to use "roast" without specifying the stove might be the issue. The correct action might be to use the stove to roast the apple and potato. But the game doesn't recognize "roast" as a verb here. Maybe the correct command is to "cook" the apple and potato on the stove. Alternatively, the user might need to use the stove first, then roast. But the game is not accepting "roast" as a verb. So the next step is to find a synonym or different phrasing. Since "roast" isn't working, maybe the correct action is to "heat" the apple and potato on the stove. But the recipe says "roast", so that's conflicting. The user needs to find the right command that the game accepts. The next action should be to use the stove to cook the apple and potato, even if the verb is different. So the correct command is to "cook green apple on stove" and "cook purple potato on stove". But the game might not recognize "cook". Alternatively, the user might need to "put" the apple and potato on the stove and then "roast" them, but the game isn't recognizing "roast". This is confusing. The user needs to try a different approach, maybe using the stove's name in the command. The correct next action is to use the stove to roast the apple and potato, even if the verb is different. So the command would be "roast green apple on stove" or "cook green apple on stove". But since "roast" isn't working, maybe "cook" is the correct verb. However, the recipe says "roast", so this is conflicting. The user is stuck, so the next step is to try a different verb or action that the game recognizes.
