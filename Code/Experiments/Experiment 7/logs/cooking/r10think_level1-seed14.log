You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You've entered a kitchen.

You can make out a fridge. The fridge contains a green bell pepper, a green hot pepper, an orange bell pepper and a raw red tuna. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out an oven. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a table. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hopefully, this discovery doesn't ruin your TextWorld experience! You can make out a counter. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. Huh, weird. You scan the room, seeing a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal using the ingredients from the kitchen. The recipe requires chopping and roasting the green bell pepper. The problem is that the user tried to "chop" the green bell pepper but got an error because they didn't use the knife properly.

First, I need to recall the steps from the recipe: chop the green bell pepper, then roast it. The user already has the knife and the green bell pepper. The error occurred when they tried to "chop" without using the knife. So the correct action should be to use the knife on the green bell pepper to chop it.

Wait, the user tried "use knife on green bell pepper" but got an error. Maybe the correct command is "chop green bell pepper with knife" or something similar. But the game might expect a specific syntax. Alternatively, maybe "cut green bell pepper with knife" is the right verb.

Looking back at the previous attempts, the user tried "chop green bell pepper" which required a knife. Then they tried "use knife on green bell pepper" which didn't work. The error message says "That's not a verb I recognise." So maybe "use" isn't the right verb here. The correct verb might be "chop" again, but this time specifying the knife. Or perhaps "cut" instead of "chop".

Alternatively, maybe the game expects the user to first use the knife on the green bell pepper to chop it. But the initial attempt to "chop" without the knife failed. So the correct sequence is to use the knife on the green bell pepper to chop it. But the user tried that and got an error. Hmm.

Wait, the user's last action was "use knife on green bell pepper" which didn't work. The error message says the verb isn't recognized. So maybe the correct verb is "chop" again, but with the knife. Or maybe "cut" is the correct verb. Alternatively, the game might require the user to "cut" the green bell pepper with the knife.

So the next step is to try using the correct verb, perhaps "cut" instead of "chop". Or maybe "chop" with the knife. Let me check the previous steps again.

The recipe says "chop the green bell pepper". The user tried "chop green bell pepper" but got an error because they didn't have the knife. Then they tried "use knife on green bell pepper" which didn't work. The error message says the verb isn't recognized. So maybe the correct action is to "cut" the green bell pepper with the knife. Alternatively, "chop" the green bell pepper using the knife.

But the game might require the user to use the knife on the green bell pepper to chop it. So the correct command would be "chop green bell pepper with knife" or "cut green bell pepper with knife". However, the game might not accept "with knife" as part of the command. Alternatively, the user might need to "use knife on green bell pepper" again, but that didn't work before.

Alternatively, maybe the correct action is to "chop green bell pepper" again, but this time the knife is already in hand. Wait, the user has the knife. So maybe the correct command is "chop green bell pepper" again, and the game will recognize it now because the knife is available. But earlier, when the user tried "chop green bell pepper" without the knife, it failed. But now, the knife is in the user's inventory. So maybe the correct action is to "chop green bell pepper" again, which should work now.

Okay, let's break this down. The goal is to cook a meal using the recipe from the cookbook. The recipe requires chopping and roasting the green bell pepper.

So far, the user has taken the green bell pepper from the fridge. The next step is to chop it. But earlier attempts to chop it resulted in errors because the knife wasn't being used properly. The user tried "chop green bell pepper" which required a knife, then tried "use knife on green bell pepper" which didn't work. Now, after taking the pepper, the user is trying to chop it again but gets a prompt asking what to chop it with. The knife is available, but the command might be incorrect.

The user is stuck in a loop where they can't properly use the knife on the pepper. The previous actions didn't progress because the verb wasn't recognized. The solution is to use the correct verb and ensure the knife is applied correctly. The correct action should be to use the knife on the green bell pepper, but the game might require a different phrasing, like "cut" instead of "chop" or specifying the action more clearly.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal using the recipe from the cookbook. The recipe requires chopping and roasting the green bell pepper. So far, the user has taken the green bell pepper from the fridge. The next step is to chop it, but they're having trouble getting the knife to work.

The user has tried "chop green bell pepper" which requires a knife, then "use knife on green bell pepper" which didn't work. Now they're trying "cut green bell pepper with knife" but the system isn't recognizing it. The error messages suggest that the verbs aren't being recognized properly. 

The user is stuck in a loop where they can't get the knife to chop the pepper. The previous actions didn't progress because the commands weren't correct. The solution is to use a different verb or phrasing. Maybe "cut" is the correct verb here instead of "chop" or "use". Alternatively, the correct command might be "cut the green bell pepper with the knife" but the system is expecting a different structure.

So the next step is to try a different command, maybe "cut green bell pepper with knife" again, but since that's not working, perhaps "cut the green bell pepper" without specifying the knife, assuming the knife is already in hand. Or maybe "cut green bell pepper" again, hoping the system now recognizes it with the knife available.

FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The user is trying to cook a meal following the recipe. The recipe requires chopping and roasting the green bell pepper. So far, they've chopped the pepper using the knife. Now, the next step is to roast it.

The user tried "roast green bell pepper" but got an error. Then they tried "roast green bell pepper with oven" and "roast green bell pepper in oven", but the system didn't recognize those as valid verbs. The problem is that the game might expect a specific command structure for roasting. Maybe the correct verb is "put in oven" or "place in oven". Alternatively, the user might need to use the stove instead of the oven. Since the stove is conventional, maybe "roast on stove" is the right action. But the game might require a different phrasing. The key is to find the correct verb that the game accepts for roasting the pepper.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to roast the green bell pepper. They've already chopped it and put it in the oven. The problem is that the game isn't recognizing the verb "roast". Previous attempts to use "roast" with different phrasings like "with oven" or "in oven" didn't work. The user is stuck in a loop where they can't get the game to accept the correct command.

The goal is to follow the recipe: chop, roast, then prepare the meal. The user has done the first two steps. Now, they need to roast the pepper. Since "roast" isn't working, maybe the correct verb is "heat" or "bake". Alternatively, the game might expect a different structure, like "roast the green bell pepper" without specifying the oven. But since the oven is already open and the pepper is inside, perhaps the correct action is to "roast" it directly. The user needs to try a different verb or phrasing that the game recognizes. The next step is to use a synonym for "roast" or adjust the command structure.

The user needs to find a synonym for "roast" that the game recognizes. Since "roast" isn't working, maybe "bake" or "sear" could be alternatives. But the game might not accept those. Alternatively, the user might need to use the stove's function. The key is to try a different verb that the game accepts.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, the user is trying to roast the green bell pepper but keeps getting errors. They've already chopped it and put it in the oven. The game isn't recognizing "roast" or "heat". The previous attempts to use "roast" with different phrasings didn't work. The user is stuck in a loop.

The goal is to follow the recipe: chop, roast, prepare. The user has done the first two steps. Now, they need to roast. Since "roast" isn't working, maybe the correct verb is "bake" or "sear". Alternatively, the game might expect a different structure, like "roast the green bell pepper" without specifying the oven. But the oven is already open. The user needs to try a different verb or phrasing that the game accepts. The next step is to use a synonym for "roast" that works.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal following the recipe. The recipe requires chopping and roasting the green bell pepper. So far, they've chopped the pepper and put it in the oven. Now, they need to roast it. But the game isn't recognizing the verb "roast" or "bake".

The user has tried multiple verbs like "roast", "heat", "bake", "sear", but none work. They're stuck in a loop where they can't get the game to accept the correct command. The problem is that the game might expect a different verb or a different structure. Maybe the correct action is to "put in oven" or "place in oven" instead of using "roast" or "bake". Alternatively, the game might require the user to use the stove instead of the oven. But the recipe says to roast, so the oven is the right place.

The user needs to find a synonym for "roast" that the game recognizes. Since "roast" isn't working, maybe "bake" or "sear" could be alternatives. But the game might not accept those. Alternatively, the user might need to use the stove's function. The key is to try a different verb that the game accepts. The next step is to try a different command, maybe "put in oven" without specifying the verb.
