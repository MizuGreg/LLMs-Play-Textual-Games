You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.

You make out a closed fridge, which looks conventional, here. You can see a closed oven right there by you. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a table. On the table you can make out a knife. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. On the counter you can make out a red apple, a green apple, a red hot pepper, a green hot pepper, a raw red potato, a green bell pepper, a tomato and a cookbook. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

There is a closed plain door leading south. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe in the cookbook. The recipe requires chopping the green apple, roasting it, chopping the red apple, frying it, and so on. But the user is having trouble with the actions.

First, they tried to chop the green apple but got an error because they didn't have the knife. Then they took the knife from the table. But when they tried to use it on the apple, it didn't work. The system keeps saying "Cutting something requires a knife," but maybe the correct action is to use the knife on the apple.

Wait, maybe the correct command is "chop green apple with knife" or something similar. But the system doesn't recognize "use knife on green apple" as a valid command. The user has already taken the knife, so the next step is to chop the green apple using the knife. The previous attempts to use "chop" didn't work because the knife wasn't used. So the correct action is to use the knife to chop the green apple. But the system might require a specific phrasing. Maybe "chop green apple" is the command, and the knife is already in hand. Wait, the user has the knife, so maybe the error is because they need to specify using the knife. But the system doesn't accept "use knife on green apple." So the correct step is to chop the green apple again, assuming the knife is now available. But the system keeps saying the same error. Maybe the correct action is to "chop green apple" without specifying the knife, since the knife is already taken. But the system says "Cutting requires a knife," so maybe the knife needs to be used. Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "cut green apple with knife." But the system doesn't recognize that. So the user is stuck in a loop. The next step is to try a different phrasing, like "cut green apple" instead of "chop," but the recipe says "chop." Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "roast" the apple after chopping. But the main issue is the chopping. The correct action is to chop the green apple with the knife, so the next command should be "chop green apple" again, even though it's the same as before. But the system might require a different approach. Maybe the user needs to "use knife on green apple" even though it's not recognized. Alternatively, the system might expect "cut" instead of "chop." But the recipe says "chop." So the answer is to try "chop green apple" again, even though it's the same as before, but the system might have a different way of handling it.

<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The user is trying to follow a recipe to cook a meal. The recipe requires chopping the green apple, roasting it, then chopping and frying the red apple, and so on. The main issue is that the user is stuck on the first step: chopping the green apple. They have the knife, but the system isn't recognizing the action.

First, the goal is to complete the recipe by gathering ingredients and following directions. So far, the user has taken the knife and tried to chop the green apple, but the system keeps saying "Cutting requires a knife." The user has repeated "chop green apple" and "use knife on green apple," but the latter isn't recognized.

The problem is likely that the system expects a specific verb or phrasing. Since "chop" isn't working, maybe "cut" is the correct verb. Alternatively, the system might require using the knife directly. But the user tried "use knife on green apple" and it didn't work. So the next step is to try a different synonym for "chop," like "cut," or maybe "slice." Alternatively, the user might need to "roast" the apple instead of chopping, but the recipe specifies chopping first.

The loop here is that the user keeps trying to chop the apple with the knife, but the system doesn't recognize the action. The solution is to use a different verb, like "cut," which might be accepted by the system. So the next action should be "cut green apple" instead of "chop."

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe. The main issue is that they can't get the green apple chopped. They've tried "chop green apple" and "cut green apple with knife," but the system isn't recognizing it. The recipe says to chop the green apple, but the system keeps saying "Cutting requires a knife." Wait, the user already took the knife. Maybe the problem is that the action needs to be "use knife on green apple" but the system doesn't accept that. Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "chop green apple" without specifying the knife, since the knife is already in hand. But the system says "Cutting requires a knife," so maybe the knife isn't being used properly. The user has tried "cut green apple with knife" but the system only understands up to "cut the green apple." So the next step is to try a different verb or phrasing. Maybe "slice" instead of "chop" or "cut." But the recipe says "chop." Alternatively, maybe the system expects the knife to be used in a different way. The user is stuck in a loop because the same actions aren't working. The solution is to use a synonym for "chop" that the system accepts, like "slice" or "dice." Let's try "slice green apple" instead of "chop."
