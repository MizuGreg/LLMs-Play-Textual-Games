You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. An usual one.

You can see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a block of cheese, a white onion, a carrot, a yellow bell pepper, an orange bell pepper, a raw pork chop and a green bell pepper! What's that over there? It looks like it's an oven. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a table. On the table you make out a knife. You can make out a counter. On the counter you can make out a red apple, a green apple, a tomato, a red hot pepper, a green hot pepper, a raw red potato, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is trying to follow a recipe from the cookbook in the kitchen. The recipe says to chop the green apple, fry the green apple, chop the red apple, roast the red apple, and then prepare the meal. 

So far, the user has taken the green apple, chopped it, and the score went up. Now they're trying to fry the green apple. The problem is that the system isn't recognizing "fry" as a valid verb here. The available commands include "fry", but maybe the correct syntax is different. 

Looking at the available commands, there's "fry ... with ...", but the user has tried "fry green apple with pan" and "fry green apple with stove", both of which resulted in errors. The system might be expecting a different structure. Maybe "fry" needs to be followed by the object and then the tool, but in a different order. Alternatively, perhaps "fry" is a verb that doesn't require specifying the tool, but the system is expecting a different action.

Wait, the user has already chopped the green apple. The next step in the recipe is to fry it. Since the system isn't recognizing "fry", maybe the correct command is "cook" instead of "fry"? Or maybe "fry" is allowed without specifying the tool. Let me check the available commands again. The available commands include "fry", so maybe the correct syntax is just "fry green apple". But the user tried that and it didn't work. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the stove or pan first. The user has the knife and the green apple. The stove is in the kitchen. Maybe the correct action is to use the stove to fry the apple. But the system is not recognizing "fry" with the stove. Maybe the correct command is "fry green apple with stove" but the system is expecting a different verb. 

Alternatively, maybe the user should use the "cook" command instead of "fry". But the recipe says "fry", so that's not helpful. 

Wait, the user is in a loop trying to fry the apple, and the system isn't recognizing the command. The previous action was "chop green apple with knife", which worked. Now, the next step is to fry the green apple. Since "fry" isn't working, maybe the user should try a different verb, like "cook" or "sear". But the recipe specifically says "fry", so that's not helpful. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to put the apple into the pan first. The pan is part of the stove. So perhaps the correct action is "put green apple in pan" and then "fry". But the system might not recognize that. 

Alternatively, maybe the user should use the "stove" as the tool. The command might be "fry green apple with stove", but the system is not recognizing it. The user has tried that multiple times. 

Hmm. The user is stuck in a loop where they can't fry the apple. The next step is to find a different way to proceed. Since the system isn't recognizing "fry", maybe the correct action is to use "cook" instead. But the recipe says "fry", so that's not helpful. 

Alternatively, maybe the user should try "heat" the pan or stove first. But the recipe says to fry, not heat. 

Wait, the user has the knife and the green apple. The next step is to fry the green apple. Since the system isn't recognizing "fry", maybe the correct command is "fry green apple" without specifying the tool. But the user tried that and it didn't work. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the "stove" as the container. The command could be "fry green apple on stove". But the system might not recognize that. 

In this case, the user is in a loop trying to fry the apple. The correct action would be to try a different verb or structure. Since "fry" isn't working, maybe the user should try "cook" instead. But the recipe says "fry", so that's not helpful. 

Alternatively, maybe the user should look for the pan or stove and use it. The user has the knife and the green apple. The next step is to fry the apple. Since the system isn't recognizing "fry", the user should try a different command, like "cook green apple with pan". But the system might not recognize that. 

In conclusion, the user is stuck trying to fry the apple. The correct action would be to try a different verb or structure, such as "cook green apple with pan" or "sear green apple". But since the recipe says "fry", the user should try "fry green apple with pan" again, even though it's been tried before. However, the system is not recognizing it, so the user needs to find another way. Maybe the correct command is "fry green apple" without the tool, but that didn't work. 

Alternatively, the user might need to use the "stove" as the tool. The correct command could be "fry green apple with stove", but the system is not recognizing it. The user is in a loop, so the next step is to try a different action, even if it's not in the recipe. Maybe the user should try "heat green apple" or "cook green apple". But the recipe specifies "fry", so that's not helpful. 

The user's next action should be to try a different command that the system might recognize, even if it's not exactly matching the recipe. Since "fry" isn't working, maybe "cook" is the correct verb. So the next action would be "cook green apple".

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The user is trying to follow a recipe from the cookbook. The recipe requires chopping and frying green apple, chopping and roasting red apple, then preparing the meal.

So far, the user has chopped the green apple and fried it. Then they took and chopped the red apple. Now they need to roast the red apple. The problem is that the system isn't recognizing "roast" with the stove or oven. The user has tried "roast red apple with stove" and "roast red apple with oven", but both are not working.

The user is stuck in a loop where they can't roast the apple. The previous actions didn't progress, so they need to find another way. Maybe "roast" isn't the right verb here. Perhaps "bake" or "sear" could be alternatives. But the recipe says "roast", so that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe the user should use the oven instead of the stove. But the system isn't recognizing "roast" with the oven.

The next step would be to try a different verb or structure. Since "roast" isn't working, maybe "cook" instead. But the recipe specifies "roast". Alternatively, the user might need to use the "stove" as the tool. The correct command could be "roast red apple on stove", but the system might not recognize that. 

In this case, the user needs to try a different action that the system might accept. Since "roast" isn't working, maybe "cook" is the correct verb. So the next action would be "cook red apple with stove".
