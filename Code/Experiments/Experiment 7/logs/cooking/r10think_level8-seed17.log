THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they need to cook a meal by finding a recipe in the kitchen. The current setup has them moving between the living room and bedroom, but they haven't found the kitchen yet.

Looking at the history, the user keeps going north and south between the two rooms, which suggests they're stuck in a loop. The goal is to reach the kitchen to check the cookbook. Since the previous actions only involve moving between rooms without progress, the next step should be to find another way to get to the kitchen. Maybe there's a different direction or an object that can be interacted with. But since the environment descriptions don't mention other exits, perhaps the user needs to look for clues or use a different action like checking the sofa or bed for items. However, the user hasn't checked those yet. Wait, in the living room, the sofa is mentioned as empty. Maybe the cookbook is on the sofa? But the user hasn't checked there. Alternatively, maybe the bedroom's bed has something. But the user hasn't looked closer. However, the previous responses were just moving directions. The user might need to look around more instead of just moving. But the instructions say to output a command like "go north". Since the user is looping between rooms, the next action should break the loop. Maybe trying a different direction, but the rooms only have north and south exits. Alternatively, perhaps the user needs to check the sofa or bed for items. But the user hasn't done that yet. Wait, the initial goal was to check the cookbook in the kitchen. So maybe the user needs to find the kitchen first. But the current rooms are living room and bedroom. Maybe the kitchen is accessible from another direction not yet explored. But the user has only moved north and south. Maybe the user needs to look for a different exit or use a different action. However, the game's responses don't mention other exits. So perhaps the user is stuck in a loop and needs to try a different action, like looking around more carefully. But the user's previous actions were just moving. So the next step is to break the loop by trying a different action, like checking the sofa or bed for the cookbook. But the user hasn't done that yet. Wait, the initial problem says to check the cookbook in the kitchen. So maybe the user needs to find the kitchen first. But the current rooms are living room and bedroom. Maybe the user needs to find another way to get to the kitchen. Alternatively, maybe the cookbook is in the living room or bedroom. But the user hasn't checked. So the next action should be to check the sofa in the living room or the bed in the bedroom for the cookbook. But the user hasn't done that yet. However, the user's previous actions were moving, so maybe the next step is to look around instead of moving. But the game's commands are limited to directions. Wait, the user is in the living room, and the sofa is there. Maybe the cookbook is on the sofa. So the user should check the sofa. But the user hasn't done that. So the next action should be to look under the sofa or check the sofa. But the game's commands might not allow that. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go to the kitchen through another exit. But the user is stuck in a loop. So the correct next action is to check the sofa in the living room for the cookbook.

You are in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.

You make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's an oven. You can make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a counter? On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato. Huh, weird. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove appears to be empty. This always happens, here in TextWorld!

There is a closed frosted-glass door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to cook a meal using the recipe from the cookbook in the kitchen. They found the cookbook, which has the recipe for three ingredients: pork chop, red onion, and white tuna. The directions mention preparing each ingredient by dicing, frying, etc.

Looking at the user's actions so far: they went through various rooms (living room, bedroom, corridor, bathroom) until they reached the kitchen. They checked the cookbook, read the recipe, and tried to take the pork chop, but it didn't work. Now, they need to collect the ingredients mentioned in the recipe.

The problem is that the user can't take the pork chop directly. Maybe the ingredients are not explicitly listed as pickable items. Instead, they might need to find them in the kitchen. The cookbook says "dice the pork chop," so perhaps the pork chop is already present in the kitchen. Alternatively, the user might need to look for the ingredients in the kitchen's objects.

In the kitchen description, there's a table with a cookbook and a knife. There's also a raw yellow potato, but that's not in the recipe. The stove is empty, and the fridge is mentioned. Maybe the pork chop is in the fridge. The user hasn't checked the fridge yet. So the next step is to open the fridge to find the pork chop.

Wait, the user tried to take the pork chop but couldn't. Maybe the pork chop is in the fridge, which is a closed door. The user needs to open the fridge, take the pork chop, then proceed to prepare it according to the recipe. The next action should be to open the fridge to retrieve the pork chop.

Okay, let's see. The user's goal is to cook a meal using the recipe from the cookbook. They've collected the required ingredients: pork chop, red onion, and white tuna. But they can only carry three items, and they've already taken all three. The next step is to follow the recipe's directions to prepare the meal.

The recipe says to dice the pork chop, fry it, chop the red onion, fry it, dice the white tuna, fry it, and then prepare the meal. Since the user has all the ingredients, they need to perform these actions in the kitchen. The stove is mentioned as being empty, so maybe they need to use it to fry the ingredients.

But the user is currently holding all three ingredients. They need to proceed with the cooking steps. The next action should be to start preparing the meal by following the directions. However, the game might require specific commands like "dice the pork chop" or "fry the pork chop". Since the user has the ingredients, they can now execute the steps in the recipe. The correct next action is to follow the recipe's instructions to cook the meal.

Okay, let's recap. The user's goal is to cook a meal using the recipe from the cookbook. They've collected the necessary ingredients: pork chop, red onion, and white tuna. They've also obtained a knife. The current step is to follow the recipe's directions.

The user has already diced the pork chop. Next, the recipe says to fry the pork chop. Since they have the knife, they might need to use it to fry the pork chop. But the knife is for cutting, not frying. Wait, the recipe says "dice the pork chop" and then "fry the pork chop". So after dicing, they need to fry it. The user has the pork chop diced and the knife. But frying requires using the stove. The stove is in the kitchen, so they need to use it. The next step is to fry the pork chop on the stove. However, the user might need to put the diced pork chop on the stove. Since the stove is empty, they can place it there. The correct action would be to fry the pork chop using the stove. But the game might require specific commands like "fry pork chop" or "put pork chop on stove". The user has already diced the pork chop, so the next step is to fry it. The answer should be to fry the pork chop.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe. They've collected the ingredients and diced the pork chop. Now they need to fry it. The problem is that the game doesn't recognize the command "fry pork chop". Maybe the correct command is "cook pork chop" or "heat pork chop". Alternatively, since the stove is in the kitchen, maybe they need to use the stove to cook it. The user has already put the pork chop on the stove. The next step is to cook it. The game might expect the command "cook pork chop" or "heat pork chop". Since "fry" isn't working, maybe "cook" is the right verb. Let's try that.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to cook a meal using the recipe from the cookbook. They've already cooked the pork chop and now need to handle the red onion and white tuna. The recipe says to chop the red onion, fry it, dice the white tuna, and fry it. The user has the red onion and white tuna but can't carry both. They tried cooking the white tuna but got stuck.

The user has already cooked the pork chop, so the next steps are to cook the red onion and white tuna. The problem is that the user can't carry both ingredients, so they need to drop one. They dropped the red onion earlier but it's already here. Now, they need to cook the red onion and white tuna. The correct commands would be to cook each ingredient using the stove. Since "cook" isn't working, maybe "fry" is the right verb. The user should fry the red onion and white tuna. The next action is to fry the red onion.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe. They've already cooked the pork chop and the red onion. Now they need to cook the white tuna. The problem is that they can't carry both the red onion and white tuna at the same time. They dropped the white tuna earlier to pick up the red onion, but now they need to cook the white tuna.

The user has the white tuna on the ground. They need to pick it up again. The correct command would be to take the white tuna. Then, use the stove to cook it. Since "cook" isn't working, maybe "fry" is the right verb. The next step is to take the white tuna and fry it.
