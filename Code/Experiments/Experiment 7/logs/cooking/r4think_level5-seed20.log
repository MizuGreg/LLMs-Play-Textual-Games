You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. An usual one.

You can make out a fridge! The fridge contains a raw pork chop, a raw white tuna, a white onion and a raw red tuna. You make out a closed oven. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a knife. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a cookbook. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.

There is an open frosted-glass door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east.

THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal based on the cookbook in the kitchen. The initial goal is to get to the kitchen, find the cookbook, check the recipe, and then cook the meal.

Looking at the previous steps, the user went from the kitchen to the living room, then to the corridor, and back to the living room. They've been moving between rooms but haven't returned to the kitchen where the cookbook is. The main issue is that they're stuck in a loop between the living room and corridor. 

The user needs to get back to the kitchen to access the cookbook. Since the previous actions were moving east and south, which led them back to the living room, the next step should be to go west from the living room to return to the kitchen. But the user has already tried going west once. Wait, in the first move, they went east from the kitchen, then south to the living room, then north to the corridor, then back south to the living room. Now, from the living room, the exit to the west is available. So going west from the living room should take them back to the kitchen. That's the next logical step to break the loop and reach the kitchen again.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to cook a meal using the recipe from the cookbook. So far, they've taken the cookbook, checked it, and followed the directions. The recipe requires slicing and roasting a pork chop and white tuna. The user tried "slice pork chop" but was told they need a knife.

Wait, the user has a knife on the table. So the next step should be to use the knife to slice the pork chop. But the user might not have taken the knife yet. Let me check the previous steps. The kitchen has a knife on the table, but the user hasn't picked it up. So the correct action is to take the knife first, then use it to slice the pork chop. But the user's last action was "slice pork chop" which failed because they didn't have the knife. So the next step is to take the knife, then slice the pork chop with it. But the user might not know to take the knife first. So the correct sequence is take knife, then slice pork chop. But the user might be stuck in a loop if they don't take the knife. So the next action should be to take the knife.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal based on the recipe. The goal is to follow the directions: slice and roast the pork chop and white tuna. So far, they've taken the pork chop, knife, and tried to slice it but got an error. The last action was "use knife on pork chop" which wasn't recognized.

First, the goal is to complete the recipe steps. The user has taken the pork chop and knife. Next step is to slice it. But the system said "use knife on pork chop" isn't a verb. Maybe the correct command is "slice pork chop" again, but they need to make sure the knife is used properly. Alternatively, maybe "cut pork chop with knife" or "slice pork chop". Since the previous attempt failed, perhaps the correct command is "slice pork chop" without mentioning the knife, as the knife is already taken. Wait, but the user has the knife, so maybe the system expects "cut" instead of "slice"? Or maybe "use knife to slice pork chop". But the system said "use knife on pork chop" isn't a verb. So the correct action is likely "slice pork chop" again, as that's the instruction in the recipe. The user might be stuck because they need to use the knife, but the system doesn't recognize "use knife on". So the next step is to try "slice pork chop" again.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to cook the meal by following the recipe. The recipe says to slice and roast the pork chop and white tuna. So far, the user has sliced the pork chop. Now, the next step is to roast it. But the user tried "roast pork chop" and it wasn't recognized. Maybe the correct verb is "roast" followed by the object. Wait, the recipe says "roast the pork chop". So perhaps the correct command is "roast the pork chop". But the system said that's not a verb. Alternatively, maybe "cook the pork chop"? But the recipe specifically says "roast". Hmm. The user might need to use the oven. The kitchen has a closed oven. So maybe the next step is to open the oven, then roast the pork chop inside. But the user hasn't interacted with the oven yet. So the correct action is to open the oven first, then roast the pork chop. But the user's last action was trying to roast the pork chop directly. So the next step is to open the oven, then use it to roast the pork chop. But the system might expect "roast" as a verb with the object. Alternatively, maybe "put pork chop in oven" and then "roast". But the recipe says "roast the pork chop". So perhaps the correct command is "roast the pork chop" again, but the system isn't recognizing it. Maybe the user needs to use the oven first.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to roast the pork chop in the oven. The previous attempts to use "roast" with the pork chop and oven didn't work. The system isn't recognizing those commands. Maybe the correct verb is "cook" instead of "roast"? Or perhaps "put" the pork chop in the oven and then "heat" it. But the recipe says "roast". Alternatively, maybe the oven needs to be preheated first. Wait, the oven is closed, so maybe the user needs to open it, then put the pork chop in, then close it and heat. But the user already opened the oven. Hmm. The recipe steps are to slice and roast. Since slicing is done, next is roast. Maybe the correct command is "put pork chop in oven" and then "roast". But the system isn't recognizing "roast" as a verb here. Maybe the user needs to use "heat" instead. Or perhaps the oven has a specific command. Alternatively, maybe the user should try "cook pork chop in oven". But the system says that's not a verb. This is tricky. The user needs to follow the recipe's directions, but the system isn't accepting the commands as expected. Maybe the next step is to use "heat" the pork chop in the oven. Or maybe " bake " instead of roast. But the recipe says roast. I'm stuck. The user needs to find a command that works. Maybe "roast" is the correct verb, but the system is expecting it in a different format. Let me try "roast the pork chop in the oven" again. Wait, the system said that's not a verb. Maybe the user needs to use "cook" instead. Or "sear"? But the recipe says roast. Maybe the correct action is to use the oven's function. Since the oven is open, maybe the user needs to put the pork chop in and then close it. But the user already opened it. Maybe the next step is to close the oven and then roast. But the user hasn't closed it yet. So the correct command is "close oven" first. Then "roast". But the user is stuck in a loop. The answer is to try a different verb or command that the system accepts.

FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook the meal according to the recipe. The recipe requires slicing and roasting a pork chop and white tuna. So far, the user has sliced the pork chop and put it in the oven. But they're stuck on the roasting part. The system isn't recognizing "roast" as a verb here. Maybe the correct action is to use the oven's function. Since the oven is open, maybe the user needs to close it and then heat it. But the user already put the pork chop in. Alternatively, maybe the next step is to slice the white tuna next. The recipe says to slice both the pork chop and the white tuna. The user has only sliced the pork chop. So the next step should be to slice the white tuna. That makes sense because the user hasn't done that yet. So the correct action is to take the white tuna from the fridge, slice it, and then roast it. But the user hasn't taken the white tuna yet. So the next step is to take the white tuna.

Since the oven is open, maybe the user needs to close it and then heat it. But the user already put the tuna in. Alternatively, maybe the next step is to check the oven's status or wait for it to heat up. But the recipe says to roast, so perhaps the correct command is "heat" instead of "roast". Or maybe "cook" the tuna in the oven. But the system says "heat" isn't a verb. Wait, the user has already put both items in the oven. Maybe the next step is to close the oven and then let it roast. But the user hasn't closed it yet. So the correct action is to close the oven first. Then, maybe the oven will automatically roast the food. But the user needs to trigger the roasting process. Alternatively, maybe the oven needs to be turned on. But the oven is closed. Hmm. The user is stuck on the roasting step. The answer is to close the oven and then maybe the roasting happens automatically. So the next action is to close the oven.

They closed the oven, and then the system said "You roasted the pork chop." So the pork chop is done. Now, the next step is to roast the white tuna.

Alternatively, maybe the next step is to check if the meal is ready. But the goal is to enjoy the meal, so maybe the user just needs to eat it. But the game might require completing all steps. The user has already done slicing and putting in the oven. The pork chop is roasted, so maybe the white tuna is now roasted as well. So the next step is to enjoy the meal. But the game might require a specific command. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to take the white tuna out of the oven. But the system hasn't recognized "roast" for the white tuna.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal. The goal is to follow the recipe steps: slice and roast the pork chop and white tuna. The user has already sliced both and put them in the oven. They closed the oven, and the system said the pork chop was roasted. Now, the white tuna is in the oven, but the user is stuck on the next step. The system isn't recognizing "roast" or "enjoy" as verbs. Maybe the correct action is to take the cooked items out of the oven and eat them. But the user hasn't done that yet. The next step is to take the pork chop and white tuna from the oven and enjoy the meal. Since the system doesn't recognize "enjoy," maybe the user needs to use a different command like "eat" or "consume." But the system says "enjoy" isn't a verb. So the final action is to eat the meal.
