You find yourself in a kitchen. A typical one.

You scan the room, seeing a fridge. The fridge contains a green bell pepper, a block of cheese, a green apple and an orange bell pepper. You can make out a closed oven. You scan the room, seeing a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a knife. Huh, weird. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a cookbook. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe in the cookbook. The recipe requires dicing the block of cheese and roasting it, then slicing the green bell pepper and frying it. The current step is trying to cut the block of cheese, but the system says that's not a recognized verb.

So, the first step is to follow the recipe's ingredients and directions. The user has already opened the cookbook and read the recipe. They tried to cut the cheese but got an error. The next step should be to find a way to dice the cheese properly. Since the user has a knife on the table, maybe they need to use the knife on the cheese. But the previous attempt to "cut block of cheese with knife" wasn't recognized. Maybe the correct command is "dice the block of cheese" using the knife. Alternatively, maybe the system expects a different phrasing, like "cut the block of cheese with the knife" or "slice the block of cheese". But since the system didn't recognize "cut", perhaps using "dice" as the verb is better. Wait, the recipe says "dice the block of cheese", so maybe the correct action is to use the knife to dice it. But the user tried "cut block of cheese with knife" and it didn't work. Maybe the correct command is "use knife on block of cheese" or "slice block of cheese with knife". Alternatively, maybe the system requires the exact phrase "dice the block of cheese" without specifying the knife. But the user has the knife, so maybe they need to use it. However, the system might not accept "use knife on block of cheese" because it's not a recognized verb. Alternatively, maybe the correct action is to "dice the block of cheese" directly, assuming the knife is available. But the user has to use the knife. Hmm. The previous attempt was "cut block of cheese with knife" which didn't work. Maybe the correct command is "dice block of cheese with knife". Let me check the previous messages. The user tried "cut block of cheese with knife" and got an error. The system said "I only understood you as far as wanting to cut the block of cheese." So maybe the system is expecting the verb "dice" instead of "cut". So the next step is to try "dice the block of cheese" using the knife. But how to phrase it. Maybe "use knife to dice block of cheese" or "dice block of cheese with knife". Alternatively, the system might require the exact phrase "dice the block of cheese" without mentioning the knife, but that might not work. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to first take the knife, but the knife is already on the table. Wait, the user can see a knife on the table. So maybe the correct action is to use the knife on the cheese. But the system didn't recognize "cut". So perhaps the correct command is "dice the block of cheese" using the knife. But the system might not accept that. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to first take the knife, then use it. But the knife is already in the room. So the next action should be to use the knife on the cheese. But the previous attempt was "cut block of cheese with knife" which didn't work. Maybe the correct command is "slice block of cheese with knife". Alternatively, maybe the system is expecting "cut" as the verb. But the user tried that. Alternatively, maybe the system is expecting "dice" as the verb. So the next step is to try "dice the block of cheese" without mentioning the knife, but that might not work. Alternatively, the user needs to use the knife to dice it. So the correct command is "use knife on block of cheese". But the system might not recognize that. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "cut the block of cheese" with the knife. But the system said it didn't recognize "cut". Hmm.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe. The recipe requires dicing the block of cheese, roasting it, slicing the green bell pepper, frying it, and then preparing the meal.

So far, the user has taken the block of cheese, the knife, and successfully diced the cheese. The next step according to the recipe is to roast the block of cheese. But the user hasn't done that yet. The previous attempts to use the knife on the cheese were successful for dicing, but now they need to roast it. However, the user might not have the correct tool or method for roasting. The oven is closed, so they need to open it first. Wait, the recipe says "roast the block of cheese," which implies using the oven. So the steps would be: open the oven, place the cheese inside, and then roast it. But the user hasn't opened the oven yet. Alternatively, maybe the oven is already accessible. The user needs to check the oven's status. The current state mentions a closed oven. So the next step is to open the oven, then put the cheese inside, and roast it. But the user might need to use the stove instead. Wait, the recipe says "roast," which is typically done in an oven. The stove is conventional but empty. So maybe the user needs to use the oven. But the oven is closed. So first, open the oven, then roast the cheese. However, the user hasn't done that yet. The previous action was dicing the cheese, so the next step is to roast it. But how? The user might need to open the oven first. So the next action should be to open the oven. Then, put the cheese in, then roast it. But the user's last action was dicing, so the next step is to roast. But the oven is closed, so open it first. So the correct next step is to open the oven.

So far, the user has diced the cheese and put it in the oven. The next step according to the recipe is to slice the green bell pepper. The user hasn't done that yet. The previous attempts to roast the cheese were unsuccessful because the verb wasn't recognized. Now, after putting the cheese in the oven, the next step should be to slice the pepper. The user needs to take the pepper from the fridge, maybe, and then slice it. But the user might have the pepper already on the counter. Wait, the initial description says the fridge has a green bell pepper. So the user needs to take the green bell pepper from the fridge, then slice it. Then, fry it. After that, prepare the meal. So the next action should be to take the green bell pepper, then slice it. But the user hasn't done that yet. The last action was putting the cheese in the oven, so the next step is to take the pepper. But the user might need to first take the pepper from the fridge.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe. The recipe requires dicing the cheese, roasting it, slicing the pepper, frying the pepper, and then preparing the meal. So far, the user has diced the cheese, put it in the oven, taken the pepper, and sliced it. The next step is to fry the pepper. But the user is having trouble with the verb "fry". The system keeps saying that's not a recognized verb. Maybe the correct verb is "cook" or "saute"? Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the stove properly. The previous attempts to use "fry" with the stove didn't work. Maybe the correct command is "cook green bell pepper on stove" or "heat green bell pepper on stove". Alternatively, since the stove is conventional, maybe "heat" is the right verb. But the recipe says "fry", so perhaps the system expects a different phrasing. The user needs to find a synonym for "fry" that the system recognizes. Alternatively, maybe the user should use the oven for roasting and the stove for frying. But the oven is already used for roasting. Wait, the recipe says "roast the block of cheese" and "fry the green bell pepper". So the user needs to fry the pepper. The correct action might be "fry green bell pepper on stove" but the system doesn't recognize "fry". Maybe the correct verb is "cook" or "heat". Alternatively, the user might need to use the stove's function. Since the user has the knife and the stove is available, maybe the correct command is "cook green bell pepper on stove". But the system might not recognize "cook". Alternatively, the user could try "heat green bell pepper on stove". But the recipe specifies "fry", so perhaps the system expects "fry" but it's not working. The user is stuck in a loop of trying "fry" which isn't recognized. The next step is to find another way to express the action. Maybe "saute" is a synonym. So the next command should be "saute green bell pepper on stove". But the system might not recognize that either. Alternatively, the user might need to use the stove's function without specifying the verb. Maybe "use stove to cook green bell pepper". But the system says "That's not a verb I recognise." So the correct action is to use a different verb. The user needs to find a verb that the system accepts for frying. Maybe "heat" is the correct verb. So the next command is "heat green bell pepper on stove".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe. The recipe requires dicing the cheese, roasting it, slicing the pepper, frying the pepper, and then preparing the meal. So far, the user has done all those steps except maybe the final preparation. The last actions were frying the pepper and trying to prepare the meal. The system says "You still miss something" when the user tries "prepare meal". The user then tried "prepare meal with cheese and pepper" and "prepare meal using cheese and pepper", but the system didn't understand.

So, the next step is to figure out what's missing. The recipe says "prepare meal" after cooking the cheese and pepper. Maybe the user needs to combine the roasted cheese and fried pepper into a meal. The correct command might be "combine roasted cheese and fried pepper" or "assemble meal with cheese and pepper". Since the system didn't recognize previous attempts, maybe the correct verb is "combine" or "assemble". The user needs to use a different phrasing. The next action should be to combine the two cooked items into a meal.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe. The recipe requires dicing the cheese, roasting it, slicing the pepper, frying the pepper, and then preparing the meal. So far, the user has done all the steps except the final preparation. The system is not recognizing the verb "prepare" or synonyms like "concoct" or "assemble". The user has tried multiple variations but keeps getting errors.

The next step should be to find a different way to phrase the final action. Since "prepare meal" isn't working, maybe the correct command is to "serve the meal" or "eat the meal", but that might not fit the recipe's instructions. Alternatively, the user might need to combine the roasted cheese and fried pepper into a dish. The correct verb here is probably "combine", but the system didn't recognize it. Maybe the system expects a different phrasing, like "put together" or "make a meal". However, the user has tried "combine" and "assemble" without success. The key is to use a verb that the system does recognize. Since all previous attempts are failing, the user needs to try a different approach. The final step is to "serve the meal" or "eat the meal", but since the goal is to cook, maybe "serve" is the right term. However, the system might not recognize "serve". Alternatively, the user might need to use the word "finish" or "complete" the meal. But the correct action according to the recipe is to prepare the meal, so the next command should be "prepare meal" again, but the system says it's not recognized. The user is stuck in a loop, so the solution is to find another synonym. The correct answer is to "serve the meal" or "eat the meal", but since the system doesn't recognize those, the user has to try "serve".

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe. The recipe requires dicing the cheese, roasting it, slicing the pepper, frying the pepper, and then preparing the meal. So far, the user has done all those steps except the final preparation. The system is not recognizing the verb "prepare" or synonyms like "concoct" or "assemble". The user has tried multiple variations but keeps getting errors.

The next step should be to find a different way to phrase the final action. Since "prepare meal" isn't working, maybe the correct command is to "serve the meal" or "eat the meal", but that might not fit the recipe's instructions. Alternatively, the user might need to combine the roasted cheese and fried pepper into a dish. The correct verb here is probably "combine", but the system didn't recognize it. Maybe the system expects a different phrasing, like "put together" or "make a meal". However, the user has tried "combine" and "assemble" without success. The key is to use a verb that the system does recognize. Since all previous attempts are failing, the user needs to try a different approach. The final step is to "serve the meal" or "eat the meal", but since the goal is to cook, maybe "serve" is the right term. However, the system might not recognize "serve". Alternatively, the user might need to use the word "finish" or "complete" the meal. But the correct action according to the recipe is to prepare the meal, so the next command should be "prepare meal" again, but the system says it's not recognized. The user is stuck in a loop, so the solution is to find another synonym. The correct answer is to "serve the meal" or "eat the meal", but since the system doesn't recognize those, the user has to try "serve".
