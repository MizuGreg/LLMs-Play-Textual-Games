You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You've just walked into a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

You make out an opened conventional looking fridge in the room. The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, a red bell pepper, a red hot pepper and a yellow onion. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You see a closed oven. You can see a table. You see a cookbook on the table. You can see a counter. You see a raw red potato, a red apple, a raw purple potato and a knife on the counter. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe in the cookbook. The recipe requires slicing and roasting the red bell pepper. So far, they've taken the red bell pepper, sliced it with the knife, and now they need to roast it.

Wait, the user tried "roast red bell pepper" but got an error. The system said that's not a recognized verb. Maybe the correct action is to use the oven. The recipe says to roast the red bell pepper, so maybe they need to put it in the oven. But the oven is closed. So first, they need to open the oven, then put the pepper inside, and then roast it. But the user hasn't opened the oven yet. So the next step should be to open the oven. Then, put the sliced red bell pepper inside. Then, roast it. But the user is stuck on the "roast" command. Maybe the correct verb is "roast" but they need to specify using the oven. Alternatively, maybe the action is "put in oven" or "place in oven". But the recipe says "roast", so perhaps the correct command is "roast red bell pepper in oven". But the system didn't recognize that. Maybe the correct action is to open the oven first. So the next step is to open the oven.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The user is trying to follow a recipe to cook a meal. The recipe requires slicing and roasting the red bell pepper. So far, they've taken the red bell pepper, sliced it with the knife, opened the oven, and put the pepper inside. But when they tried to roast it, the system didn't recognize the verb.

Hmm, the error message says "That's not a verb I recognise." So maybe the correct action isn't "roast" but something else. The recipe says "roast the red bell pepper," but perhaps the system expects a different command. Maybe "put in oven" is the correct verb here. Wait, they already put it in the oven. Or maybe "heat" or "cook"? But the recipe specifically says roast.

Alternatively, maybe the oven needs to be turned on. The user opened the oven, but maybe they need to activate it. The oven is closed, so perhaps they need to open it first, then put the pepper in, then turn it on. But the user already opened the oven and put the pepper in. So the next step should be to roast it. But the system doesn't recognize "roast." Maybe the correct command is "roast red bell pepper in oven," but the system didn't accept that. Or maybe "roast" is the correct verb, but the user needs to specify the oven. Wait, the user tried "roast red bell pepper in oven" earlier and it didn't work. So maybe the correct action is to use the oven's function. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the stove instead. But the recipe says roast, which usually means using the oven.

Wait, the user has the red bell pepper in the oven. So the next step is to roast it. But the system isn't recognizing "roast." Maybe the correct command is "heat" or "cook." But the recipe says roast. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the stove. But the recipe says roast, which is typically done in the oven. Maybe the system expects the user to use the stove's function. But that's conflicting with the recipe. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the oven's verb. Since the oven is open, perhaps the correct action is to "roast" it. But the system doesn't recognize it. Maybe the user should try a different verb. The previous attempt was "roast red bell pepper in oven," which didn't work. So maybe the correct action is "put in oven" again, but that's already done. Or maybe "heat oven" first. Wait, the user hasn't heated the oven yet. So maybe the correct sequence is: open oven, put pepper in, heat oven, then roast. But the user already put the pepper in. So the next step is to heat the oven. But the recipe says roast. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the stove. But the recipe says roast. This is confusing. 

The user is stuck because the system doesn't recognize "roast." So the next step is to find a synonym or alternative command. Maybe "cook" instead of "roast." Or "heat" the red bell pepper. But the recipe specifies roast. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the stove. But the recipe says roast. Hmm. The correct action here is probably to use the oven's function. Since the user can't use "roast," maybe the correct command is "heat" or "cook." But the recipe says roast. So the user needs to find a way to make the system recognize the action. Maybe the correct command is "roast red bell pepper" without specifying the oven, but the system doesn't accept it. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the stove. But the recipe says roast. 

Wait, the user has the red bell pepper in the oven. So the next step is to roast it. But the system doesn't recognize "roast." So the user needs to try a different verb. Maybe "cook" or "heat." But the recipe says roast. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the oven's verb. Since the oven is open, maybe the correct action is "roast" but the system is not accepting it. So the user has to find another way. Maybe the correct action is "put in oven" again, but that's already done. 

In this case, the user is in a loop. They tried "roast" but it's not recognized. So the next step is to use a different verb, like "heat" or "cook." But the recipe says roast. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the stove. But the recipe says roast. This is a problem. The correct action is to roast the red bell pepper in the oven, but the system isn't recognizing the verb. So the user needs to find a synonym. Maybe "roast" is the correct verb, but the system is not accepting it. Therefore, the user should try a different command, like "cook" or "heat."

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe. The recipe requires slicing and roasting the red bell pepper and red potato, and frying the yellow bell pepper and red potato. The user has already taken the red bell pepper, sliced it, put it in the oven, and roasted it. Now they need to handle the red potato.

The user tried "roast red potato in oven" multiple times, but the system doesn't recognize it. The previous successful action was "heat red bell pepper in oven," which worked. Maybe the correct verb is "roast" but the system is expecting a different command. Alternatively, maybe "cook" or "fry" is the correct verb. But the recipe says "roast the red potato," so perhaps the user needs to use the oven again.

Wait, the user already put the red bell pepper in the oven and roasted it. Now for the red potato, maybe they need to slice it first. The recipe says "slice the red potato" before roasting. The user hasn't done that yet. So the next step is to slice the red potato with the knife. Then put it in the oven and roast it. But the user is stuck on the "roast" command. Maybe the correct action is to use "roast" without specifying the oven, but the system doesn't recognize it. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the stove for frying, but the recipe says roast. This is confusing.

The user is in a loop trying to roast the red potato. The previous successful action was "heat" for the bell pepper. Maybe the correct verb here is "heat" again. So the next step is to heat the red potato in the oven. But the recipe says roast. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the stove. But the recipe specifies roast. So the correct action is to roast, but the system doesn't recognize it. Therefore, the user should try a different verb, like "heat" or "cook." But the recipe says roast. Hmm. The user needs to find a way to make the system recognize the action. Maybe the correct command is "roast red potato in oven" but the system is not accepting it. So the user has to try a different approach.
