You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

Well how about that, you are in the place we're calling the bedroom.

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a bed. The bed is large. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

On the counter you can see a tomato. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is a closed plain door leading south. There is an exit to the west.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the cookbook in the kitchen. They've already opened the cookbook, but the system said it isn't something you can open. Wait, maybe I need to check the previous steps again.

First, the goal is to find the recipe in the kitchen, use the cookbook, and then cook. The user went from bedroom to living room, then corridor, then kitchen. In the kitchen, they saw a cookbook on the table. The user tried to open it, but the system said it's not possible. Maybe the cookbook is already openable, or perhaps the user needs to pick it up first?

Wait, the initial instruction was to "check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe." So maybe the user needs to pick up the cookbook first. But the user tried to open it, which might not be the right action. The correct step might be to take the cookbook, then open it. But the system said "It isn't something you can open," so maybe the cookbook is already open, or the user needs to read it instead?

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to look at the cookbook to find the recipe. But the system's response was that opening it isn't possible. So perhaps the next step is to take the cookbook, then look at it. But the user's last action was "open cookbook," which failed. So the next action should be to take the cookbook instead. Let me check the available objects in the kitchen: there's a cookbook and a knife on the table. So the user needs to take the cookbook first, then maybe open it. But the system said opening isn't possible. Maybe the cookbook is already open, so the user needs to read it. But the game might require the user to open it first. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the cookbook to find the recipe, which would involve looking at it. But the system's message says that opening isn't possible, so perhaps the user needs to take the cookbook first. So the next action should be "take cookbook" instead of opening it. That makes sense. So the user should take the cookbook, then maybe open it. But the system said opening isn't possible, so maybe the user needs to read it. But the correct action here is to take the cookbook first. So the next command should be "take cookbook".

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to cook a meal using the recipe from the cookbook. They've already taken the cookbook and looked at the recipe, which lists ingredients: lettuce, red tuna, tomato. The directions mention slicing, roasting, chopping, etc.

But the user tried to "take lettuce red tuna tomato" and got a negative response. So maybe the ingredients aren't directly takeable. Instead, they need to find each ingredient in the kitchen. The kitchen has a fridge, oven, stove, counter with a tomato. Wait, the user saw a tomato on the counter. So maybe they need to take the tomato first. Then find lettuce and red tuna elsewhere, like in the fridge. But the user hasn't checked the fridge yet. The previous steps were taking the cookbook, looking at it, then trying to take the ingredients, which didn't work. So the next step should be to check the fridge for lettuce and red tuna. Alternatively, take the tomato from the counter. Let's try taking the tomato first. Then check the fridge for the other ingredients. That makes sense. So the next action should be to take the tomato from the counter.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to collect the ingredients for the recipe. They have the tomato and lettuce. The red tuna is in the fridge. The problem is that when they try to take the red tuna, they're carrying too many things. So maybe they need to take the red tuna first before taking the lettuce? Wait, no, they already took the lettuce. Hmm. Maybe the issue is that they can only carry one item at a time. So they need to take the red tuna now, even though they have the lettuce. Alternatively, maybe the system is confused by the command "take lettuce red tuna" and only takes the lettuce. So the next step is to take the red tuna separately. But the user is carrying the lettuce, so they can't take another item. Wait, the user has the lettuce in their inventory. So they need to drop the lettuce to take the red tuna. But the game might not allow that. Alternatively, maybe the user should just take the red tuna now, even if they have the lettuce. The system might be allowing only one item at a time. So the correct action is to take the red tuna now, even if they have the lettuce. So the next command should be "take red tuna".

Okay, let's recap. The user needs to collect all three ingredients: lettuce, red tuna, and tomato. They've already taken the tomato and the lettuce, then dropped the lettuce to take the red tuna. Now they have the red tuna and the tomato. The next step is to prepare the meal according to the recipe. The recipe directions include slicing the lettuce, roasting the lettuce, chopping the red tuna, frying the red tuna, dice the tomato, roast the tomato, then prepare the meal. Since the user has all ingredients, they need to follow the steps. The next action should be to slice the lettuce. But the game might require using the right tools. The user has a knife on the table. So maybe they need to take the knife first. Wait, the user hasn't taken the knife yet. So the steps are: take the knife, then perform the actions. But the user is currently holding the red tuna. So first, take the knife, then slice the lettuce. But the user is in the kitchen, so the next command should be to take the knife. Alternatively, since they have the tomato and red tuna, maybe start with the first step of the recipe: slice the lettuce. But they need the knife. So the correct next action is to take the knife.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the recipe to cook a meal. They have the lettuce, red tuna, and tomato. The first step in the recipe is to slice the lettuce. But they need a knife. They tried taking the knife but couldn't because they were carrying too many things. Then they tried using the knife on the lettuce but got an error. Now, they need to slice the lettuce. The problem is they don't have the knife. So the next step is to take the knife first. But they can't carry both the red tuna and the knife. So maybe they need to drop the red tuna to take the knife. But the game might not allow that. Alternatively, maybe they can take the knife while holding the lettuce. Wait, the user is currently holding the red tuna and the lettuce. So they need to drop the red tuna to take the knife. But the system says they can't carry too many things. So the correct action is to drop the red tuna, then take the knife, then slice the lettuce. But the user is in a loop here. The next command should be to take the knife, even if they have to drop something else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to cook a meal using the recipe from the cookbook. They've collected the tomato, lettuce, and red tuna. But they're stuck because they can't carry all items. They dropped the red tuna to take the knife. Now they need to slice the lettuce. The next step is to take the knife. Since they dropped the red tuna, they can now take the knife. Then, they can use the knife to slice the lettuce. After that, follow the recipe steps. So the next action is to take the knife.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.
