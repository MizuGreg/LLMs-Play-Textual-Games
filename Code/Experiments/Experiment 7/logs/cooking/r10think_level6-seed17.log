THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a loop between the Livingroom and Bedroom, moving north and south repeatedly. The goal is to cook a meal using the cookbook in the kitchen. So far, the user has only been moving between rooms without exploring other options.

First, the goal is to find the cookbook in the kitchen, check the recipe, and then cook. But the current actions are just moving back and forth. The user hasn't looked for any objects like a cookbook or kitchen. 

Looking at the previous steps, every time they go north or south, they end up in the same rooms. So they're stuck in a loop. The next step should be to look for the cookbook instead of moving. Maybe the kitchen is in one of these rooms, but the user hasn't checked.

Since the user is in the Livingroom, maybe there's a hidden object or a different action needed. The instruction says to use synonyms if repeating the same action. Instead of going north again, perhaps checking the surroundings or looking for items. The cookbook might be in the livingroom or bedroom, but the user hasn't looked closely.

So the next action should be to look around or check the sofa for the cookbook. The user needs to break the loop by exploring the current room for the cookbook instead of moving.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to cook a meal by finding the cookbook in the kitchen. So far, they've been moving between the living room and bedroom, but haven't found the cookbook.

First step: The goal is to find the cookbook, check the recipe, and cook. So far, the user hasn't found the cookbook yet. Next step would be to look for it in the current room or adjacent areas.

Second step: Past actions include moving north and south, looking around, checking the sofa, bed, and bedroom. None of these have found the cookbook. The next step should be to check other possible locations, maybe the kitchen, but the user hasn't explored that yet.

Third step: The user is stuck in a loop between the two rooms. To break the loop, they need to try a different approach. Instead of moving, they should look for the cookbook in the current room or check other areas. Since the previous actions didn't work, maybe the cookbook is in the kitchen, which is north from the living room. But the user hasn't tried that yet.

Finally, the next action should be to go north to the kitchen and look for the cookbook. That's a different action from before, breaking the loop and moving towards the goal.

You can make out a bed. But there isn't a thing on it. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset.

There is an exit to the north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Livingroom and Bedroom, moving north and south repeatedly. The goal is to find the cookbook in the kitchen to cook a meal. So far, the user hasn't found the cookbook yet.

First step: The goal is to find the cookbook, check the recipe, and cook. The user hasn't found the cookbook yet. Next step would be to look for it in the current room or adjacent areas.

Second step: Past actions include moving between rooms, looking around, checking the sofa, bed, and bedroom. None of these have found the cookbook. The next step should be to check other possible locations, maybe the kitchen, but the user hasn't explored that yet.

Third step: The user is stuck in a loop. To break it, they need to try a different approach. Instead of moving, they should look for the cookbook in the current room or check other areas. Since the previous actions didn't work, maybe the cookbook is in the kitchen, which is north from the living room. But the user hasn't tried that yet.

Finally, the next action should be to go north to the kitchen and look for the cookbook. That's a different action from before, breaking the loop and moving towards the goal.

Well, here we are in a corridor. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.



There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door. There is an exit to the south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.

Okay, let's tackle this. The user is stuck in a loop, repeatedly looking in different directions in the corridor but not finding the cookbook. The goal is to find the cookbook in the kitchen to cook a meal.

First step: The goal is to find the cookbook, check the recipe, and cook. So far, the user hasn't found the cookbook. They've been moving between rooms and looking around without success.

Second step: Past actions include moving through rooms, looking in various directions (north, south, west, east), but nothing has yielded the cookbook. The next step should be to check other possible locations or think differently.

Third step: The user is in a loop, not making progress. They need to break the loop by trying a different approach. Instead of just looking around, maybe they need to check inventory or think where the kitchen might be. Since the corridor has exits in all directions, maybe the kitchen is in one of them. But the user hasn't tried exploring further.

Finally, the next action should be to go north again, as that's the direction leading to the kitchen. But since the user has already tried that, maybe they need to use a synonym like 'proceed north' or check another exit. However, the system might require a different command. Alternatively, maybe the cookbook is in the corridor, and the user needs to look more carefully. But the previous looks didn't find anything. So the next step is to try a different direction or action.

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.

You make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a raw pork chop, a raw white tuna, a red bell pepper, a yellow onion, a white onion and a raw red tuna. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's an oven. You can make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a counter? On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato. Huh, weird. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove appears to be empty. This always happens, here in TextWorld!

There is an open frosted-glass door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook the pork chop with the red onion and white tuna. The problem is that the previous attempts to use multiple objects with the "cook" verb didn't work. The recipe says to dice, fry each ingredient separately, then prepare the meal.

So, the goal is to follow the directions step by step. The user has already taken the pork chop, red onion, and white tuna. Now, they need to process each ingredient individually. The error is trying to cook all three at once. The correct approach is to cook each item one by one using the "fry" action. So, first dice the pork chop, then fry it. Then chop the red onion and fry it. Similarly for the white tuna. After all are fried, combine them into a meal. The next step is to fry the pork chop first.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is trying to cook the pork chop with the red onion and white tuna. They've already diced the pork chop and need to fry it. The previous attempts to use "fry" with the knife didn't work. The recipe says to fry each ingredient separately. Maybe the correct verb is "cook" instead of "fry"? Or perhaps "saute"? But the system might not recognize those. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the stove. Since the stove is in the kitchen, maybe the action is "put on stove" or "heat". But the user has the knife, so maybe "fry" is the right verb. Wait, the user tried "fry pork chop with knife" and it didn't work. Maybe the correct command is just "fry pork chop" without the knife. Or maybe "cook pork chop". Let me check the previous steps. The user has the knife, so maybe the correct action is "fry pork chop with knife" but the system doesn't recognize it. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the stove. The stove is in the kitchen, so maybe "put pork chop on stove" or "heat pork chop". But the recipe says to fry, so perhaps the correct verb is "fry". Since the system isn't recognizing it, maybe the user should try a different synonym. The next step is to fry the pork chop using the knife and stove. But the correct command might be "fry pork chop".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook the pork chop, but they're stuck on the stove. The goal is to follow the recipe steps: dice, fry each ingredient. They've already diced the pork chop and put it on the stove. The error is that "stove is hot" isn't a verb. The next step should be to actually cook the pork chop by using the stove. Since "fry" isn't working, maybe the correct action is "cook" or "heat". But the system might require a different command. The user needs to proceed to the next step in the recipe, which is to fry the red onion and white tuna. But they're stuck on the pork chop. Maybe the correct action is to "fry pork chop" even if it's not recognized, or use "cook" with the stove. Alternatively, since the stove is hot, maybe the pork chop is already cooking. But the recipe says to fry each item separately. The user needs to move on to the next ingredient after cooking the pork chop. But the system is not recognizing the correct verbs. The next step is to try a different verb or command to proceed.
