You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

I am sorry to announce that you are now in the kitchen. Let's see what's in here.

You can see an opened fridge nearby. The fridge contains a green bell pepper, a block of cheese, a yellow onion, a raw white tuna, a green hot pepper, an orange bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a red onion, a raw red tuna, a red bell pepper and a carrot. You can make out an oven. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a table. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hopefully, this discovery doesn't ruin your TextWorld experience! You can make out a counter. On the counter you make out a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. Huh, weird. You scan the room, seeing a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.

SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe in the cookbook. The recipe requires dicing the block of cheese, frying it, and then processing the vegetables. The user tried to "dice the block of cheese" but got an error because they didn't use the knife properly.

First, I need to recall the correct steps. The user has the knife on the counter. The previous attempt was "use knife on block of cheese," but the system said that's not a recognized verb. Maybe the correct command is "dice the block of cheese with the knife" or something similar. But since the system didn't recognize "use knife on," maybe the correct verb is "cut" instead of "dice"? Wait, the recipe says "dice the block of cheese," so maybe the user needs to use the knife to dice it. But the system might expect a different phrasing.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to first pick up the knife. Wait, the user is already in the kitchen, and the knife is on the counter. So the user needs to take the knife first. But in the previous steps, the user tried to use the knife on the cheese without taking it. So maybe the correct sequence is: take the knife, then use it to dice the cheese.

But the user's last action was "use knife on block of cheese," which didn't work. The system said that's not a recognized verb. So perhaps the correct command is "cut the block of cheese" instead of "dice," or "slice" instead of "dice." Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "dice the block of cheese" without mentioning the knife, but the system requires using the knife. Wait, the recipe says "dice the block of cheese," which is an action that requires a knife. So maybe the correct command is "dice the block of cheese with the knife," but the system might not recognize that. Alternatively, the user might need to "use the knife to dice the block of cheese."

But the system's error message says "That's not a verb I recognise," so maybe the correct verb is "cut" instead of "dice." Let me check the recipe again. The recipe says "dice the block of cheese," so the user needs to perform that action. However, the system might require the user to use the knife. So the correct command might be "cut the block of cheese" or "slice the block of cheese." Alternatively, the user might need to "dice the block of cheese" using the knife, but the system doesn't recognize that. So maybe the user should try "cut the block of cheese" instead.

You need to specify how you want to cut the block of cheese. Either slice, dice, or chop it.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is trying to follow a recipe to cook a meal. The first step is to dice the block of cheese. They tried "use knife on block of cheese" but got an error. Then they tried "cut the block of cheese" but the system said they need to specify the method. Now they're trying "cut the block of cheese with the knife," but the system didn't recognize it.

So, the goal is to follow the recipe's instructions. The user has already checked the cookbook and started with the cheese. The next step is to dice the cheese, but the system isn't accepting the current commands. The user is stuck in a loop because the previous actions aren't working. To break the loop, they need to use a different synonym or correct phrasing. Maybe "slice" instead of "cut" or "dice" instead of "cut." Alternatively, using the knife properly by taking it first. But the system might require a specific verb. The correct action might be "dice the block of cheese" without mentioning the knife, but since the system didn't recognize it before, perhaps "slice" is the right verb here.
