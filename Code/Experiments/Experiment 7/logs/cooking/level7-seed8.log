A closed fridge is right there by you. You can see a closed oven. You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is?

There is a closed plain door leading east. There is an exit to the north. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to win this game. The goal is to cook a delicious meal, right? So I need to follow the recipe from the cookbook. Let me check what I've done so far.

First, I started in the living room, went east to the kitchen. Then I opened the fridge and took a carrot. Then I kept going back and forth between the living room and kitchen, taking items like yellow apple, red apple, and raw red potato. Each time I take an item, my score increases. But the problem is that the fridge is empty now, and the oven is closed. The stove is conventional but has nothing on it. The counter has some ingredients left, but I need to use them in a recipe.

Wait, the cookbook is on the table. Maybe I need to check the cookbook for the recipe. But I haven't done that yet. The ingredients I've collected so far are carrot, yellow apple, red apple, and red potato. Maybe the recipe requires these? But how do I cook them? The oven is closed, so I need to open it. Then maybe put the ingredients in and cook them. But the stove is conventional, but there's nothing on it. Maybe I need to use the stove instead of the oven?

Wait, the user mentioned that the oven is closed. So first, I should open the oven. Then, maybe use the stove to cook the ingredients. But the stove has nothing on it. Maybe I need to put the ingredients on the stove. But the problem is that the oven is closed, so I need to open it first. Let me check the steps again.

So, the next step would be to open the oven. Then, perhaps use the ingredients I've collected to make a dish. But I need to follow the recipe from the cookbook. However, the cookbook is on the table, so maybe I need to read the recipe first. But in the game, maybe the recipe is implied by the ingredients. Alternatively, maybe the game expects me to use the ingredients I've collected and cook them in the oven or stove.

But the stove is conventional, but there's nothing on it. Maybe I need to put the ingredients on the stove. But the oven is closed. So first, open the oven, then put the ingredients in, then cook. But I have to make sure I have all the required ingredients. Let me check the items I have: carrot, yellow apple, red apple, red potato. Maybe the recipe requires these. But I need to use the oven or stove to cook them.

Wait, the user's previous actions were taking items from the counter, but the oven is closed. So the next logical step is to open the oven. Then, maybe use the ingredients to cook a meal. But the stove is also there. Maybe the game expects me to use the stove. But since the stove has nothing on it, perhaps I need to put the ingredients there. However, the oven is closed, so I need to open it first. Let me try opening the oven now.

Okay, let's break this down. The goal is to cook a meal using the ingredients from the kitchen. So far, I've collected a carrot, two apples, and a potato. I opened the oven and put the carrot in, but then I had to take it out again. Now, I need to figure out how to cook it properly.

Wait, the game prompt said "What do you want to cook the carrot with?" So maybe I need to use other ingredients. I have apples and a potato. Maybe make a stew or a salad? But the oven is closed. Oh, right, the oven is open now. Maybe I should use the oven to cook the carrot with other ingredients.

But the stove is there too. Maybe I need to use the stove instead. But the stove has nothing on it. Maybe I need to put the carrot and other ingredients on the stove. But the game is expecting me to use the oven since it's open. Let me try putting the carrot and apples in the oven. Wait, but the user asked what to cook it with, so maybe I need to specify the recipe. But since I have the cookbook, maybe I should refer to it. However, the game might not require that. 

Alternatively, maybe the next step is to use the stove. Since the oven is open but maybe not the right place. The stove is conventional, so perhaps using it is better. But the stove has nothing on it. So I need to put the ingredients there. Let me try putting the carrot and apples on the stove. But the game might require using the oven. Hmm. I need to make sure I'm not repeating the same action. Previously, I tried putting the carrot in the oven but had to take it out. Now, maybe I should use the stove. Let me try that.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The goal is to cook a meal using the ingredients from the kitchen. So far, I've collected a carrot, two apples, and a potato. I opened the oven, put the carrot and red apple inside, but couldn't cook them because I needed a heat source. The stove is there, but I couldn't use it properly.

Wait, the oven is already open. Maybe I should use the oven as the heat source. The problem was that I tried to use the stove, which wasn't recognized. So maybe the correct action is to use the oven to cook the carrot and apple. But earlier, when I tried putting them in the oven, it worked, but then I had to take the carrot out. Now, after taking the carrot, I need to cook it with the apple using the oven's heat. The error message said "Cooking requires a source of heat," so maybe I need to specify using the oven. Let me try that.

Okay, let me try to figure this out. The goal is to cook a meal, so I need to use the ingredients I have. I've collected a carrot, two apples, and a potato. The oven is open, and I put the carrot and apple inside. But I can't seem to cook them because the game is expecting a different command.

Wait, the previous attempts to cook failed because I tried using "cook" with multiple items. Maybe I need to use the stove instead. But the stove was mentioned as conventional but having nothing on it. Maybe I need to put the ingredients on the stove. But the game said "use stove" wasn't a verb. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the correct action is to use the oven's heat. Since the oven is open, perhaps I need to activate it. But the game didn't have a "heat" command. Maybe "cook" is the right verb, but I need to specify the oven. Let me try "cook carrot and apple in oven" again. But the game says that's not allowed. Maybe I need to cook them one at a time. First cook the carrot, then the apple. But how?

Wait, the user tried "cook carrot with apple" and got an error. Maybe the correct way is to use the stove as the heat source. But the game didn't recognize "use stove". Maybe the correct command is "heat stove" or "light stove". But I'm not sure. Since the oven is open, maybe I should just cook them in the oven. But the game is not accepting multiple items. Maybe the answer is to cook the carrot first, then the apple separately. But I need to follow the game's commands. Let me try "cook carrot in oven" and then "cook apple in oven".
