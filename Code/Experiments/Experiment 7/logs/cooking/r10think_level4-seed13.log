You see an opened fridge. What a letdown! The fridge is empty! You make out a closed oven right there by you. Look over there! a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Look over there! a counter.

The wall opens up to reveal a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty. You move on, clearly depressed by your TextWorld experience.

There is an open plain door leading south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to win this game. The goal is to cook a delicious meal, right? So I need to follow the recipe from the cookbook. Let me check what I've done so far.

First, I went from the pantry to the kitchen. In the kitchen, I found a cookbook, a knife, and some vegetables: yellow potato, purple potato, and yellow onion. I took all of them. Now, I have the cookbook, the knife, and the three vegetables. The next step should be to use the cookbook to find the recipe and then cook the meal using the ingredients.

Wait, the cookbook is closed. Oh, right, earlier I tried to open it but couldn't. Then I took it. Maybe I need to open it now. Once open, the recipe would tell me how to prepare the meal. Then, using the stove, I can cook the ingredients. But the stove is empty. Do I need to put the vegetables on it? But I have the knife, so maybe I need to chop them first? Or maybe the recipe doesn't require chopping. Let me think.

The user mentioned that the stove is conventional but empty. So maybe after opening the cookbook, I can find the steps. The recipe might involve using the stove to cook the potatoes and onion. Since I have all the ingredients, the next step is to open the cookbook to get the recipe, then use the stove to cook the meal. But I need to make sure I'm not repeating actions. Earlier, I went back and forth between pantry and kitchen, but now I'm in the kitchen again. Let me check the items again.

I have the cookbook, knife, two potatoes, and an onion. The oven is closed, but maybe I don't need it. The recipe might be simple, like boiling or frying. Since the stove is there, maybe I should use that. But the stove is empty. So perhaps I need to put the ingredients on the stove. But how? Maybe the recipe requires using the stove, and once I have all the ingredients, I can cook them. But I need to follow the steps from the cookbook. So the next action should be to open the cookbook to get the recipe steps. Then, follow those steps to cook the meal. But I have to make sure I don't loop. Earlier, I was going back and forth, but now I'm in the kitchen. So the next step is to open the cookbook.

Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is trying to cook a meal using the ingredients they've gathered. The recipe from the cookbook says to dice the yellow potato, fry it, and prepare the meal. But the user is having trouble with the "fry" command.

First, I need to recall the steps. The user already diced the potato, which was a success. Now, the next step according to the recipe is to fry the yellow potato. But every time they try to use "fry", the system says it's not a recognized verb. Maybe "fry" isn't the right command here. Perhaps they need to use a different verb like "cook" or "heat" instead. Alternatively, maybe the action is to place the diced potato on the stove. Since the stove is there, maybe the correct action is to put the potato on the stove to cook it. The user has the knife, so maybe they need to use it to prepare the potato further, but they already diced it. Wait, the recipe says "fry the yellow potato", so maybe the action is to use the stove to fry it. Since the stove is conventional, maybe the command is "put yellow potato on stove" or "cook yellow potato on stove". The user tried "fry" but it didn't work. So the next step is to use a different verb, like "cook" or "heat", or perhaps "place on stove". The key is to find the correct action that the game recognizes. Since "fry" isn't working, maybe "cook" is the right verb. So the next action should be to cook the yellow potato using the stove.

You find yourself in a livingroom. An ordinary kind of place. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."

Oh, great. Here's a sofa. The sofa is comfy. However, the sofa, like an empty sofa, has nothing on it.

There is an exit to the east. There is an exit to the west.

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

You see an opened fridge. What a letdown! The fridge is empty! You make out a closed oven right there by you. Look over there! a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Look over there! a counter. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty. You move on, clearly depressed by your TextWorld experience.

There is an open plain door leading south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.
