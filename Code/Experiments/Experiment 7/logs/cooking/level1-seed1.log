You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

You've just shown up in a kitchen. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You can see an opened fridge. What a letdown! The fridge is empty! You can make out a closed oven. Oh, great. Here's a table. You see a cookbook on the table. Huh, weird. You can see a counter. You see a raw red potato, a red bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife on the counter. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.

SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a kitchen and needs to cook a meal. The goal is to find a recipe, gather ingredients, and cook something. The first step was checking the cookbook, but it wasn't openable. So maybe the cookbook is closed, and the user needs to open it. But the user tried to open it and it didn't work. Wait, the initial description said the cookbook is on the table, but when they tried to open it, it wasn't possible. Maybe the cookbook is a book that needs to be read, not physically opened. Or maybe there's a different way to access the recipe.

Wait, the user's first action was "open cookbook", but the response said it isn't something you can open. So maybe the cookbook is a book that's already on the table, and the user needs to read it instead of opening it. Or perhaps the cookbook is a digital device, but the game is text-based. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to take the cookbook first before opening it. Let me check the initial description again.

In the kitchen, the user sees a cookbook on the table. So the first step should be to take the cookbook. Then, once taken, maybe read it to find the recipe. But the user tried to open it immediately, which didn't work. So the correct sequence is: take the cookbook, then read it to get the recipe. Then, use the ingredients from the counter (potato, pepper, knife) and the stove to cook. The oven is closed, but maybe the stove is the right place to cook. So the next step after taking the cookbook is to read it, then proceed to cook using the available ingredients.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal in the kitchen. The goal is to check the cookbook for a recipe, then use the ingredients to make a meal.

First, they were in the kitchen, saw the cookbook on the table. They tried to open it but couldn't. Then they took the cookbook. Now, they have the cookbook. Next step is to check the recipe inside. But maybe the cookbook is closed, so they need to open it. Wait, the user just took the cookbook, so maybe the next step is to open it. But the previous attempt to open failed. Maybe the cookbook is closed, so they need to open it again. Alternatively, maybe they need to look at the cookbook's contents. But the game might require opening it first. So the next action should be to open the cookbook. But the user already tried that and it didn't work. Hmm, maybe the cookbook is in their inventory now, so they can open it. Wait, the previous response was "take cookbook", and now the game says they took it. So now, the next step is to open it. But the user tried to open it before and it didn't work. Maybe the cookbook is closed, so they need to open it. So the next action is to open the cookbook. But the user needs to make sure they do that. So the answer should be "open cookbook".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal in the kitchen. The goal is to check the cookbook for a recipe, then use the ingredients to make a dish. So far, they took the cookbook from the table but couldn't open it. The previous action was trying to open it, which didn't work.

First step: The goal is to cook a meal. That requires finding a recipe (the cookbook), which they have. Then, they need to use the ingredients available, like the potatoes and bell pepper, and the knife. The stove is there, but it's conventional, so maybe they need to use it to cook.

Second step: They took the cookbook but couldn't open it. So they need to figure out how to use it. Maybe the cookbook is in a different format, like a book that needs to be read, not opened. Or perhaps they need to look at it to find the recipe.

Third step: They tried to open it, which didn't work. So maybe they should try a different action, like reading the cookbook instead of opening it. Or maybe the cookbook is already in their inventory, so they can look at it to find the recipe.

Next action: Since opening didn't work, maybe "read cookbook" or "look at cookbook" would be the next step. But the system might expect a different command. Alternatively, since they have the ingredients, maybe they should start preparing the dish. But the recipe is needed first. So the next step is to read the cookbook to find the recipe.

So far, they took the cookbook, tried to open it, but it wasn't possible, then read it. The recipe says to gather a red potato and follow the directions: slice, fry, prepare.

Now, the next step would be to get the red potato. Wait, in the kitchen description, there's a raw red potato on the counter. So the user needs to pick it up. But the previous action was reading the cookbook, so the next logical step is to take the potato. But the user might have already taken it? Let me check the history. The user took the cookbook from the table. Then tried to open it, which didn't work. Then read it. The ingredients listed are red potato. So the user needs to gather the potato. So the next action should be to take the red potato from the counter. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next command should be 'take red potato' or something similar. But the system might expect a different phrasing. Alternatively, maybe 'get red potato' or 'pick up red potato'. But the previous action was 'read cookbook', so the next step is to take the ingredient. So the answer should be 'take red potato'.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal in the kitchen. The goal is to follow the recipe from the cookbook to prepare a dish. So far, they've taken the red potato from the counter, which was the first step according to the recipe.

Now, the next step in the recipe is to slice the red potato. The user has the potato, so the next action should be to slice it. But wait, do they have a knife? The inventory mentions a knife on the counter. Oh right, the user took the cookbook and the potato. The knife is still on the counter. So they need to take the knife first, then slice the potato.

Wait, but the previous action was taking the red potato. The next step in the recipe is to slice it. But to slice, they need the knife. So maybe the user needs to take the knife first. But the user hasn't taken the knife yet. So the correct next step is to take the knife, then slice the potato. But the user might not have realized they need the knife. So the next action should be to take the knife. Alternatively, maybe they can slice without the knife, but that's not possible. So the correct sequence is take the knife, then slice the potato. But the user's last action was taking the potato. So the next step is to take the knife. But the user might not have taken the knife yet. So the next action should be to take the knife. Then, after that, slice the potato. But the user's last action was taking the potato, so the next step is to take the knife. But the user might not have done that yet. So the next action is take knife. Then slice the potato. But the user hasn't taken the knife yet. So the next action is take knife. But the user might not have done that.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe in the cookbook. The recipe says to slice the red potato, fry it, and then prepare the meal. So far, they've taken the red potato and the knife, sliced the potato. Now they're trying to fry it but got an error because "fry" isn't recognized.

Hmm, maybe the game expects a different verb for frying. Like "cook" instead of "fry"? Or maybe "heat" the pan first? Wait, the recipe says "fry the red potato," so perhaps the action is to put it in a pan and heat it. But the game might have specific commands. Since "fry" isn't working, maybe the correct command is "cook" or "heat." Alternatively, maybe they need to use the stove. The user has the stove in the room. So maybe the next step is to use the stove to cook the sliced potato. Let me check the previous steps. The user has the knife and the potato. They sliced it. Now, they need to cook it. The stove is there. So the correct action might be to put the sliced potato on the stove and cook it. But the game might require a specific verb. Since "fry" isn't working, maybe "cook" is the right word. Alternatively, "heat" the pan first. But the recipe says "fry," so maybe the game expects "fry" but it's not recognized. Wait, maybe the user needs to use the stove first. So the steps would be: take the stove, heat it, then fry the potato. But the user hasn't interacted with the stove yet. So maybe the next action is to use the stove to cook the potato. Alternatively, since the user is holding the knife, maybe they need to use the stove. Let me think. The correct command here is probably "cook the red potato" or "fry the red potato" but since "fry" isn't working, maybe "cook" is the right verb. Alternatively, the game might require using the stove. So the next action could be "cook the red potato" or "put the red potato on the stove." But the user is holding the knife, so maybe they need to use the stove. Let me check the previous steps again. The user is at step 2/8. The next step after slicing is to fry. Since "fry" isn't working, maybe the correct action is "cook" instead. So the next command should be "cook the red potato." But the game might require a different phrasing. Alternatively, maybe "heat the stove" first. But the recipe says to fry, so maybe the correct action is "fry" but the game doesn't recognize it. Wait, maybe the user needs to use the stove. So the correct command is "put the red potato on the stove" or "cook the red potato on the stove." But the game might have specific verbs. Since the user is holding the knife, maybe they need to use the stove. So the next action is to use the stove to cook the potato.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe in the cookbook. So far, they've taken the red potato, sliced it, and now they're trying to fry it. The problem is that they need to use the stove, but when they tried to go to the stove, they couldn't see it. Wait, the recipe says to fry the potato, so they need to use the stove. But the stove is conventional, but maybe it's not turned on or they need to put the pot on it. Alternatively, maybe they need to use the oven? But the oven is closed. Wait, the recipe says "fry the red potato," which typically requires a stove and a pan. But the user might not have a pan. Hmm, the ingredients listed are just the red potato. Maybe they need to use the stove directly. But the previous attempt to go to the stove didn't work. Maybe the correct action is to use the stove instead of going there. Or perhaps they need to put the sliced potato into the oven? But the oven is closed. Wait, the recipe says "fry," so stove is the right place. Maybe the user needs to use the stove's heating element. Alternatively, maybe they need to put the potato in a pan and then place the pan on the stove. But since there's no pan, maybe they have to use the stove as is. The user tried "go to stove" but couldn't see it. Maybe the correct action is to "use stove" or "turn on stove." But the system might not recognize those. Alternatively, maybe they need to "put the sliced potato on the stove." But the stove is conventional, so maybe the action is to "cook the potato on the stove." But the previous attempt to cook it resulted in a question about what to cook it with. So maybe the user needs to use the stove's heating element. Alternatively, maybe the oven is the right place, even though it's closed. But the recipe says fry, which is usually stove. Hmm. The next step would be to use the stove to cook the potato. So the command should be something like "cook the red potato on the stove." But the system might require a different phrasing. Alternatively, since the user is at the stove, maybe they need to "place the potato on the stove." But the previous attempt to go to the stove didn't work. Maybe the correct action is to "use the stove" or "heat the stove." But the system might not recognize those. Alternatively, since the user has the knife and the potato, maybe they need to "fry the potato" directly. But the system said "That's not a verb I recognise." So maybe the correct action is to "put the potato on the stove" or "place the potato on the stove." But the user tried "fry" and it didn't work. So perhaps the correct action is to "cook the potato on the stove." But the system might require a specific command. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "turn on the stove" first. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next step is to use the stove to cook the potato. The previous action was trying to cook it, which led to a question. So maybe the correct action is to "put the sliced potato on the stove." But the user hasn't put it there yet. So the next command should be "put the sliced red potato on the stove." But the system might not recognize that. Alternatively, since the user is at the stove, maybe they can just "cook the potato." But the system said "That's not a verb I recognise." So maybe the correct action is to "use the stove to cook the potato." But the system might not accept that. Alternatively, the user needs to "heat the stove" first. But the user hasn't done that. So the next step is to use the stove. The correct command would be "use stove" or "cook on stove." But the system might require "cook the red potato on the stove." However, the user tried "cook the red potato" and it didn't work. So maybe the correct action is to "put the potato on the stove." But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next command should be "put the sliced red potato on the stove."

Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is trying to cook a meal in a kitchen game. The goal is to follow the recipe from the cookbook to prepare a meal. So far, they've taken the red potato, sliced it, and put it on the stove. The next step would be to fry it, but the system didn't recognize "fry" as a valid command. Instead, they tried "cook" and were asked what to cook it with. Then they went to the stove, but couldn't see it. Now, they put the sliced potato on the stove, and the score increased.

Wait, the recipe says to "fry the red potato" after slicing. But the user tried "fry" and it didn't work. Then they tried "cook" and were prompted for an ingredient. Maybe the correct action is to use the stove. Since the stove is conventional, maybe they need to use it to cook the potato. The previous action was putting the potato on the stove, so maybe the next step is to wait for it to cook? But the game might require a specific command. Alternatively, maybe they need to use the oven. But the oven is closed. Wait, the user has a knife and the stove is there. Maybe the correct next step is to "turn on the stove" or "heat the stove". But the game might expect a different command. Alternatively, since the potato is on the stove, maybe the next step is to "cook the red potato" again, but using the stove. Or perhaps the game is expecting "fry" to be used with the stove. Since the user previously tried "fry" and it didn't work, maybe they need to use a different verb. Alternatively, maybe the correct action is to "use the stove" or "cook on the stove". But the system might not recognize those. Alternatively, since the stove is there, maybe the next step is to "cook the red potato on the stove". But the system might require a specific command. Alternatively, maybe the game is expecting "fry" to be used with the stove. Since the user is on the stove, maybe the next step is to "fry the red potato". But the system said "That's not a verb I recognise." So maybe the correct command is "cook the red potato on the stove". But the system might not accept that. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "heat the stove" first. But the user already put the potato on the stove. Hmm. The previous action was putting the potato on the stove, so the next step is probably to cook it. But the system didn't recognize "fry". Maybe the correct action is "cook the red potato" without specifying, but the system asked what to cook it with. Maybe the user needs to use the stove as the cooking method. So the next command should be "cook the red potato on the stove". But the system might not accept that. Alternatively, maybe the correct action is "use the stove to cook the red potato". But the system might require a different command. Since the user is on the stove, maybe the next step is to "cook the red potato". But the system said "That's not a verb I recognise."

So far, they've taken the red potato, sliced it, and put it on the stove. But when they tried to "fry the red potato," the system said that's not a recognized verb.

Hmm, maybe the correct action is to use the stove. Since the potato is on the stove, the next step would be to cook it. But the system might expect a specific command. The user previously tried "fry" which didn't work. Maybe the correct verb is "cook" instead of "fry"? Or perhaps they need to use the stove's action. Wait, the stove is conventional, so maybe the action is to "cook the potato on the stove." But the system might require a different phrasing.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the word "stove" in the command. Like "use the stove" or "cook on the stove." But the previous action was putting the potato on the stove. So the next step is to actually cook it. Since "fry" didn't work, maybe "cook" is the correct verb here. Let me check the recipe again. The directions say "fry the red potato," but the system doesn't recognize "fry." Maybe the correct action is "cook the red potato," but the system might expect "fry" even though it's not recognized. Wait, but the user tried "fry" and it didn't work. So perhaps the correct action is to use the stove's function. Maybe the command should be "cook the red potato on the stove." But the system might require a different phrasing. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "turn on the stove" first, but that's not in the recipe. The recipe just says to fry it, so maybe the correct action is to "cook the red potato," even if "fry" isn't recognized. Alternatively, maybe the system expects "fry" but it's not working, so the user needs to try a different verb. Since "cook" is a general term, maybe that's the right choice.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal in the kitchen. The goal is to follow the recipe from the cookbook. So far, they've taken the red potato, sliced it, and put it on the stove. But when they tried to "cook the red potato," it didn't work because they needed to take it first.

Wait, the error message says, "You need to take the red potato first." That suggests that the potato is currently on the stove, so it's not in their inventory. To cook it, they need to have the potato in hand. So the next step should be to take the potato from the stove, then cook it.

But the previous action was putting the potato on the stove. So now, the potato is on the stove, not in the player's possession. Therefore, the correct action would be to take the potato from the stove. Once they have it, they can cook it. Let me check the previous steps again.

The user had sliced the potato and put it on the stove. Now, they need to take it from the stove to cook it. So the next command should be "take the red potato from the stove" or something similar. But the system might expect a shorter command like "take red potato" or "take potato." However, since it's on the stove, maybe they need to specify the location. But the game might have limited commands. Alternatively, maybe "cook the red potato" is the next step once it's taken. But the error occurred because the potato wasn't taken. So the correct action is to take it first. Therefore, the next command should be "take red potato" to get it from the stove, then cook it.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal in the kitchen. The goal is to follow the recipe from the cookbook. So far, they've taken the red potato, sliced it, and fried it. The recipe says to slice, fry, and prepare the meal. The user has already done the first two steps. Now, the next step should be to "prepare the meal" as per the recipe. But the user might not know what that entails. Since the previous actions were slicing and frying, maybe "prepare the meal" is just confirming that the meal is ready. But the game might require a specific command. The user tried "cook the red potato" before, which didn't work, but then "cook the red potato on the stove" worked. Now, after frying, the next step is probably to finish preparing the meal. Since the score increased to 3, maybe they need to finish the recipe steps. The next action should be to "prepare the meal" or something similar. But the game might expect a different phrasing. Alternatively, maybe the meal is considered prepared once the potato is fried, but the recipe says "prepare meal" as a step. So the user needs to do that. The correct next command would be "prepare the meal".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe in the cookbook. The recipe says to slice the red potato, fry it, and then prepare the meal. So far, they've taken the red potato, sliced it, and fried it. Now they're at the step where they need to "prepare the meal."

But when they tried "prepare the meal," the system didn't recognize it. So maybe the correct term is "serve the meal" or "eat the meal"? But the game might be expecting a specific command. Since the previous step was frying the potato, the next logical step is to serve it. However, the user might need to check if there's another ingredient or step they missed. Wait, the recipe only mentions the red potato. So after frying, the meal is ready. Maybe the correct action is "serve the meal" or "eat the meal." But the system might have a specific term. Alternatively, maybe "prepare the meal" is the correct term, but the user's previous attempt was misphrased. Let me check the previous interactions. The user tried "prepare the meal" and got an error. So perhaps the correct command is "serve the meal" or "eat the meal." But since the game is a text-based adventure, maybe the correct term is "serve the meal." Alternatively, maybe "finish the meal" or "complete the meal." But the user needs to follow the recipe's exact steps. The recipe says "prepare the meal" after frying. So maybe the correct action is "prepare the meal," but the system didn't recognize it. Maybe the user needs to use a different phrasing. Alternatively, maybe the meal is already prepared once the potato is fried, so the next step is to enjoy it. But the goal is to cook the meal, so perhaps "serve the meal" is the next step. Let me think. The user's last action was frying the potato, which is the third step in the recipe. The recipe's directions are: slice, fry, prepare. So after frying, the next step is to prepare the meal. But the system didn't recognize "prepare the meal." Maybe the correct command is "serve the meal" or "eat the meal." Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check if the meal is ready. But the game might require the exact phrase. Since the user tried "prepare the meal" and it didn't work, maybe the correct action is "serve the meal." So the next command should be "serve the meal."

That's not a verb I recognise.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal in the kitchen. The goal is to follow the recipe from the cookbook. So far, they've taken the red potato, sliced it, fried it, and now they're at the step where they need to "prepare the meal." But the system isn't recognizing "prepare" as a valid command.

Looking back at the recipe, the directions say: slice the red potato, fry the red potato, prepare meal. The user has already done the first two steps. The next step is "prepare meal." But when they tried "prepare the meal," the system said it didn't understand. Maybe the command needs to be more specific or use a synonym.

Alternatively, maybe "prepare the meal" is the correct command, but the system is expecting a different phrasing. Since "prepare" isn't working, perhaps the user needs to use a different verb. But what's the next logical step after frying the potato? Maybe "serve the meal" or "eat the meal," but the user tried "serve" and it wasn't recognized.

Wait, the recipe says "prepare meal," so maybe the correct action is to "prepare the meal" without the article. But the system might be expecting a different action. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the stove or oven. But the stove is already used. The oven is closed. Maybe the user needs to put the fried potato into the oven? But the recipe doesn't mention that.

Alternatively, maybe "prepare the meal" is the correct command, and the system's error is a glitch. The user has already completed the steps: sliced, fried, so the next step is to prepare the meal. Even though the system says it doesn't understand, maybe the correct command is "prepare meal" without the article. Let's try that.

Okay, let me try to figure out what the next step should be. The user's goal is to cook a meal and enjoy it. So far, they've followed the recipe steps: gathered the red potato, sliced it, fried it, and prepared the meal. The score is now 4/13, which suggests there are more steps left.

Looking at the recipe again, the directions were to slice, fry, and prepare the meal. The user has already done the first two steps. The "prepare meal" step might involve putting the cooked potato on the plate or serving it. But in the previous attempt, when they tried "prepare the meal," it didn't work. Then they tried "serve the meal," which was unrecognized. Now, after adding the meal to inventory, the next logical step would be to eat it or serve it.

But the game might require a specific command. Since the user added the meal to their inventory, the next step is probably to eat it. The correct command would be "eat the meal" or "consume the meal." However, the game might use "eat" as the verb. Let me check previous interactions. The user tried "serve" and "prepare," which didn't work. So maybe "eat" is the right verb here. Alternatively, "have the meal" or "consume the meal." But the game might expect "eat" as the action. So the next command should be "eat the meal."
