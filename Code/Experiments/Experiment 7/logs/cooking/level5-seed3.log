You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Bathroom =-
You've just sauntered into a bathroom.

If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a toilet. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.

-= Kitchen =-
You've just shown up in a kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.

Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a fridge! The fridge contains a raw pork chop! You see an oven. You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a knife. You can see a counter. On the counter you see a raw red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it. You swear loudly.

There is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an exit to the west.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal based on the cookbook in the kitchen. So the main goal is to find the recipe, follow the steps, and cook something.

Looking at the previous steps, they navigated through the bathroom, corridor, bedroom, living room, and finally the kitchen. In the kitchen, they found the cookbook, but couldn't open it. The fridge has a raw pork chop, the oven is there, the table has a knife, potatoes, a pepper, and the cookbook. The stove is there but empty.

Wait, the user tried to open the cookbook but it wasn't possible. Maybe the cookbook is in a place that needs to be interacted with differently. The fridge has a raw pork chop. Maybe the recipe requires using that ingredient. The user needs to find the recipe steps. Since the cookbook isn't openable, maybe they need to look for another way to get the recipe, like using the ingredients available.

But the user is in the kitchen, so maybe they need to use the ingredients from the fridge and the table. The raw pork chop, potatoes, pepper, and knife. Maybe the recipe is to cook the pork chop with the potatoes and pepper. The oven is available, so they can use that. The stove is there but empty, but maybe the oven is the way to go.

So the next step is to use the pork chop from the fridge, prepare it with the potatoes and pepper, and cook it in the oven. But how to do that in the game? Maybe the user needs to take the pork chop, use the knife to cut it, then put it in the oven with the potatoes and pepper. But the game might require specific commands like 'take pork chop', 'cut pork chop with knife', 'put in oven', etc.

But the user hasn't taken any items yet. So the next action should be to take the pork chop from the fridge. Then maybe proceed to cook it. But the user is stuck because they can't open the cookbook. Maybe the recipe is in the cookbook, but since it's not openable, perhaps the user needs to use the ingredients available. Alternatively, maybe the cookbook is a book that needs to be read, but the game doesn't allow opening it. So the user has to proceed with the available items.

So the next step is to take the pork chop from the fridge. Then use the knife to prepare it, then cook it in the oven. But the user is in the kitchen, so the next command should be to take the pork chop.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to cook a meal using the cookbook in the kitchen. So far, they've navigated to the kitchen, found the cookbook, but couldn't open it. Then they tried to take the pork chop from the fridge, which worked. Now they're trying to cut the pork chop with the knife but the system isn't recognizing the commands.

First step: The goal is to find the recipe in the cookbook, gather ingredients, and cook the meal. So far, they've taken the pork chop. Next step is to use the cookbook's recipe to prepare the dish.

Second step: Past actions include navigating to the kitchen, taking the pork chop. The next step should be to use the cookbook, but since it's not openable, maybe they need to find another way. But the user is stuck on cutting the pork chop. The system isn't accepting the commands, so maybe they need to use a different verb or structure.

Third step: The user is in a loop trying to cut the pork chop. The previous actions aren't working. Instead of "cut pork chop with knife," maybe use "prepare pork chop" or "cook pork chop." Alternatively, since the oven is available, maybe put the pork chop in the oven. But the user needs to first cut it. However, the system isn't recognizing the commands. So perhaps the correct action is to "put pork chop in oven" once it's cut. But since the system isn't accepting the cut command, maybe the next step is to directly use the oven. But the user needs to follow the recipe. Alternatively, maybe the cookbook's recipe is to use the ingredients available, so after taking the pork chop, the next step is to cook it in the oven. So the next command should be "put pork chop in oven."

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal using the cookbook in the kitchen. The main goal is to follow the recipe, gather ingredients, and cook the dish. So far, they've navigated to the kitchen, taken the pork chop from the fridge, put it in the oven, and tried to wait for it to finish. But the system isn't recognizing "wait for oven to finish" and keeps prompting the same response.

First step: The goal is to cook the meal. The user has already taken the pork chop and put it in the oven. The next step would be to let the oven do its job, but the system isn't accepting the wait command. Maybe the correct action is to "cook pork chop" or "use oven" instead of waiting.

Second step: Past actions include taking the pork chop and putting it in the oven. The next step should be to finish cooking it. Since waiting isn't working, perhaps the user needs to use a different verb, like "cook" or "heat."

Third step: The user is in a loop trying to wait. The system doesn't recognize "wait," so the next action should be a synonym, like "cook" or "use oven." The correct command might be "cook pork chop" or "use oven on pork chop."

Finally, the next action should be to cook the pork chop using the oven. The correct command is likely "cook pork chop" or "use oven on pork chop." Since the user previously put it in the oven, maybe "cook pork chop" is the right command.

FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to cook a meal using the cookbook in the kitchen. So far, they've navigated to the kitchen, taken the pork chop from the fridge, put it in the oven, and tried to wait for it to finish. But the system isn't recognizing "wait for oven to finish" and keeps prompting the same response.

First step: The goal is to follow the recipe, gather ingredients, and cook the dish. The user has already taken the pork chop and put it in the oven. The next step is to finish cooking it, but the system isn't accepting the wait command. Maybe the correct action is to use the oven's functionality directly.

Second step: Past actions include taking the pork chop and putting it in the oven. The next step should be to let the oven cook it, but since waiting isn't working, perhaps the user needs to use a different verb, like "cook" or "heat."

Third step: The user is in a loop trying to wait. The system doesn't recognize "wait," so the next action should be a synonym, like "cook" or "use oven." The correct command might be "cook pork chop" or "use oven on pork chop." Since the user previously put it in the oven, maybe "cook pork chop" is the right command.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal using the cookbook in the kitchen. The main goal is to follow the recipe, gather ingredients, and cook the dish. So far, they've navigated to the kitchen, taken the pork chop from the fridge, put it in the oven, and tried to wait for it to finish. But the system isn't recognizing "wait for oven to finish" and keeps prompting the same response.

First step: The goal is to cook the meal. The user has already taken the pork chop and put it in the oven. The next step is to finish cooking it. Since waiting isn't working, maybe the correct action is to use the oven's functionality directly.

Second step: Past actions include taking the pork chop and putting it in the oven. The next step should be to let the oven cook it, but since waiting isn't working, perhaps the user needs to use a different verb, like "cook" or "heat."

Third step: The user is in a loop trying to wait. The system doesn't recognize "wait," so the next action should be a synonym, like "cook" or "use oven." The correct command might be "cook pork chop" or "use oven on pork chop." Since the user previously put it in the oven, maybe "cook pork chop" is the right command.
