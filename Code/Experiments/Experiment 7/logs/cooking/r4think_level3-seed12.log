You're now in a kitchen. You begin looking for stuff.

You smell a fine smell, and follow it to a fridge. The fridge contains a raw red tuna, a lettuce, a red onion, a raw white tuna and a white onion. You make out a closed oven. You can see a table. You see a cookbook on the table. Classic TextWorld. You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a tomato, a green hot pepper and a knife. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is in a TextWorld game where they need to cook a meal using the ingredients from the kitchen. The goal is to follow the recipe from the cookbook.

First, the user checked the cookbook and found Recipe #1, which requires lettuce, red tuna, and tomato. The directions say to slice the lettuce, roast it, chop the red tuna, fry it, dice the tomato, roast the tomato, and then prepare the meal.

So far, the user tried to slice the lettuce but was told they need a knife. They took the knife from the counter but tried to slice the lettuce again, which didn't work. The error message says "That's not a verb I recognise," which probably means the action "slice" isn't being recognized when using the knife.

Wait, maybe the correct action is to use the knife on the lettuce. The user tried "use knife on lettuce" but got an error. Maybe the correct command is "slice the lettuce with the knife" or something similar. But in TextWorld, the commands are usually more straightforward. Let me think about the possible verbs. The user has the knife, so maybe they need to "cut" the lettuce instead of "slice"? Or perhaps "chop"?

Looking back at the recipe, the first step is "slice the lettuce," but the user tried that and got an error. The knife is available, so the next step should be to use the knife to slice the lettuce. The error might be because the user didn't specify the object correctly. Maybe the correct command is "slice the lettuce with the knife" or "cut the lettuce with the knife."

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "use the knife on the lettuce" but the system doesn't recognize "use" as a verb here. The previous attempt was "use knife on lettuce," which didn't work. So maybe the correct action is "slice the lettuce" again, but since the user already has the knife, perhaps the system is expecting the knife to be used in the action.

Wait, the user has the knife now. So the next step is to slice the lettuce using the knife. The correct command might be "slice the lettuce" again, but the system might require the knife to be involved. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "cut the lettuce" with the knife. But the recipe says "slice," so maybe the correct action is "slice the lettuce" again, even though it failed before. But the user tried that and got the same error. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "chop the lettuce" instead of "slice." But the recipe says "slice." Maybe the system is expecting a different verb. Let me check the previous steps again.

The user tried "slice the lettuce" but got an error. Then they took the knife. Then tried "slice the lettuce" again, which didn't work. Then tried "use knife on lettuce," which also didn't work. So the problem is that the system isn't recognizing the action. Maybe the correct command is "cut the lettuce with the knife." But the recipe says "slice," so maybe the user needs to use the knife to slice it. Alternatively, maybe the correct verb is "cut" instead of "slice."

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "chop the lettuce" with the knife. But the recipe says "slice." Maybe the system is expecting "cut" as the verb. Let me think: in TextWorld, the verbs are usually specific. So if the recipe says "slice," the correct action is "slice," but the user might need to use the knife. So the correct command is "slice the lettuce with the knife," but the system might not recognize that. Alternatively, the user might need to "use the knife to slice the lettuce."

But the user tried "use knife on lettuce" and got an error. So maybe the correct action is "slice the lettuce" again, but the system is not recognizing it. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "cut the lettuce" with the knife. But the recipe says "slice," so maybe the user should follow the recipe's instructions exactly.

Wait, the user has the knife now. So the next step is to slice the lettuce using the knife. The correct command might be "slice the lettuce" again, but the system is not recognizing it. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "cut the lettuce" with the knife. But the recipe says "slice," so maybe the user should try "slice" again. However, the previous attempt failed. Maybe the system is expecting the user to use the knife in the action. So the correct command is "use the knife to slice the lettuce." But the user tried "use knife on lettuce," which didn't work. Maybe the correct command is "slice the lettuce with the knife." But the system might not recognize that.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "chop the lettuce" with the knife. But the recipe says "slice." This is confusing. The user is stuck because the previous actions didn't work. The next step is to find a different action, maybe using a synonym for "slice," like "cut" or "chop." Since the recipe says "slice," but the system isn't recognizing it, the user might need to try "cut" instead. So the next action should be "cut the lettuce" with the knife. But the user has the knife, so maybe "cut the lettuce with the knife." But the system might not recognize that. Alternatively, the user might need to "chop the lettuce."

But the recipe says "slice," so maybe the correct action is "slice the lettuce" again, even though it failed before. However, the user tried that and got an error. So maybe the user needs to try a different verb. The answer is to use "cut" instead of "slice." So the next action is "cut the lettuce."

You need to specify how you want to cut the lettuce. Either slice, dice, or chop it.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe from the cookbook. The recipe requires slicing lettuce, roasting it, chopping red tuna, frying it, dicing tomato, roasting tomato, and preparing the meal.

So far, the user has taken the knife from the counter. They tried to slice the lettuce but got an error. Then they tried using the knife on the lettuce, which also didn't work. Now, the system is prompting them to specify how to cut the lettuce, suggesting slice, dice, or chop.

The user's next step should be to actually perform the cutting action. Since the previous attempts with "slice" and "use knife on lettuce" didn't work, maybe the correct command is to "chop the lettuce" instead of "slice." The recipe says "slice," but maybe the system expects "chop" as a valid action here. Alternatively, using the knife to chop the lettuce might be the right move.

The user is in a loop because they keep getting errors for the same actions. To break the loop, they need to try a different verb. Since "chop" is an option provided by the system when asked to cut the lettuce, using "chop" instead of "slice" might work. So the next action should be "chop the lettuce with the knife" or simply "chop the lettuce."

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal in a TextWorld game. The recipe requires slicing lettuce, roasting it, chopping red tuna, etc. So far, they took the knife, tried to slice the lettuce but got errors, then tried chopping. Now, the system says they need to take the lettuce first, but they can't see it.

Wait, the user is in the kitchen. The fridge has lettuce, but the user hasn't taken it yet. The table has a tomato and green hot pepper, but the lettuce is in the fridge. The user tried to take the lettuce from the table, which doesn't exist. So the correct step is to go get the lettuce from the fridge.

So the past actions: took the knife, tried slicing and chopping lettuce. Now, the next step is to take the lettuce from the fridge. The error was trying to take it from the table. So the correct command is "take lettuce from fridge" or similar. But the user needs to first go to the fridge. Wait, the user is currently in the kitchen, and the fridge is in the same room. So the user should take the lettuce from the fridge. The previous attempt was taking it from the table, which is wrong. So the next action is to take the lettuce from the fridge.
