-= Livingroom =-
You are in an usual kind of place. That is to say, you're in a livingroom.

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a sofa. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

You need an exit without a door? You should try going south. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.

-= Bedroom =-
You have moved into the most typical of all possible bedrooms. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

You make out a bed. You wonder idly who left that here. The bed is large. But the thing is empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the bed! oh well.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through a text-based game. The goal is to cook a meal by finding a recipe in the kitchen. So far, they've moved from the living room to the bedroom. The current location is the bedroom, and the next step would be to find the kitchen.

First, I need to recall the game's objective: find the cookbook in the kitchen, follow the recipe, and then enjoy the meal. The user has already moved west from the living room to the bedroom. Now, they need to find a way to get to the kitchen. The bedroom's description mentions an east exit, so maybe going east from the bedroom is the next step. But the user might be stuck in a loop if they keep moving between rooms without progress. 

Wait, the user's previous actions were "go west" from the living room to the bedroom. The bedroom's east exit is mentioned, so going east from there would be the logical next step. But the user might not have explored other directions yet. Alternatively, maybe there's a different path. However, based on the current information, the next step is to go east from the bedroom to reach the kitchen. The user needs to move towards the kitchen to find the cookbook. So the next action should be "go east".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in a text-based game. The goal is to cook a meal by finding a recipe in the kitchen. So far, they've moved from the living room to the bedroom and back to the living room. The challenge is to figure out the right path to the kitchen without getting stuck in a loop.

First, I need to recall the game's objective: find the cookbook in the kitchen, check the recipe, then cook. The user is currently in the living room again after moving east from the bedroom. The previous actions were going west from the living room to the bedroom, then east back to living room. That's a loop between living room and bedroom. 

So, the next step is to break the loop. Since the user is advised to go south from the living room, maybe that's the way to go. The initial instructions said to try going south when in the living room. The user might have missed that earlier. So the next action should be to go south to find the kitchen or another exit leading to the kitchen. 

I need to make sure not to repeat the same action. The user tried west and east, which brought them back. Now, going south is a new direction. That should lead them out of the living room towards the kitchen. So the correct next command is "go south".

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. An ordinary one.

Were you looking for a fridge? Because look over there, it's a fridge. You see a closed oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. You see a raw yellow potato, a yellow onion and a raw purple potato on the counter. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.

There is a closed plain door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door.

The kitchen has the cookbook, a knife, and some ingredients like potatoes and an onion. The next step is to find the cookbook, which they mentioned is on the table. Wait, the user hasn't picked up the cookbook yet. So the first step is to take the cookbook from the table. Then, they need to use it to find a recipe. After that, they can gather the ingredients and cook the meal. But in the current room, the user is in the kitchen, so the next action should be to take the cookbook. Let me check the previous actions again. They went west to the kitchen, so now they need to pick up the cookbook. The user hasn't done that yet. So the next command should be to take the cookbook.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the cookbook in the kitchen. So the goal is to find the recipe, get the ingredients, and then cook something.

First, they went through the living room, bedroom, and now are in the kitchen. They took the cookbook from the table. Now, the next step would be to check the cookbook for the recipe. But the user has to follow the steps correctly.

Wait, the previous action was taking the cookbook. Now, the next logical step is to open the cookbook to find the recipe. But in TextWorld, sometimes you need to use specific commands. So maybe "open cookbook" or "read cookbook". But the user might need to look for the recipe inside. Once they have the recipe, they need to gather the ingredients mentioned. The kitchen has a potato, onion, and another potato. Maybe the recipe requires those. Then, using the stove and oven to cook them. But the oven is closed, so they need to open it. But the user hasn't done that yet.

Wait, the user is at the kitchen, took the cookbook. Now, the next step is to check the cookbook for the recipe. So the command should be "open cookbook" or "look at cookbook". But the user might need to read it. Then, after getting the recipe, they need to collect the ingredients. The ingredients are already present: potatoes and onion. Then, cook them using the stove or oven. But the user hasn't used the stove yet. So maybe the next step is to check the cookbook, then find the ingredients, then cook.

But the user's last action was taking the cookbook. So the next step is to open it. So the command would be "open cookbook". But the user might need to read it. Alternatively, "look at cookbook" to find the recipe. But the system might expect "open" to access it. So the next action is to open the cookbook.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal based on the cookbook in the kitchen. So far, they've gone through the living room, bedroom, and now the kitchen. They found the cookbook on the table and tried to open it, but it wasn't possible.

First, I need to recall the goal: the user needs to check the cookbook for a recipe, then cook the meal. The current step is that they have the cookbook but can't open it. Maybe the next step is to look for ingredients or find a way to use the cookbook. But since the cookbook isn't openable, perhaps they need to find another way to get the recipe, like looking for a recipe card or another clue.

Wait, in the kitchen, there are ingredients listed: raw yellow potato, yellow onion, raw purple potato. Maybe the recipe is to use these. But the user needs to cook them. The stove is there, so maybe they need to cook the ingredients. But the oven is closed. Maybe the user needs to use the stove. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the cookbook is a book that needs to be read, but since it's not openable, perhaps the user needs to look for another way. But the user is in the kitchen, so maybe the next step is to use the ingredients to make a meal. But the user hasn't cooked anything yet. The goal is to cook a meal, so maybe the user needs to take the ingredients and cook them. But the user hasn't taken the ingredients yet. Wait, the user is holding the cookbook, but the ingredients are on the counter. So maybe the next step is to take the ingredients, then use the stove to cook them. But the user hasn't taken any ingredients yet. So the next action should be to take an ingredient, like the potato or onion.

But the user's last action was trying to open the cookbook, which didn't work. So the next step is to look for ingredients. The user is in the kitchen, so they need to take the ingredients from the counter. The possible ingredients are the potatoes and onion. So the next action should be to take one of them. For example, take the yellow onion. Then, after taking the ingredients, use the stove to cook them. But the user hasn't taken any ingredients yet. So the correct next step is to take an ingredient. The user might need to take the onion or potato. Let's check the available items again. The counter has raw yellow potato, yellow onion, and raw purple potato. So the user can take one of these. The next action should be to take the onion, for example.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the cookbook in the kitchen. So far, they've gone through the living room, bedroom, and now the kitchen. In the kitchen, they took the cookbook but couldn't open it, then took the yellow onion. Now they need to proceed.

The goal is to find the recipe in the cookbook, gather ingredients, and cook a meal. The user has the onion, but the cookbook is closed. Maybe they need to find another ingredient or figure out how to use the cookbook. Since the cookbook was taken but couldn't be opened, perhaps they need to look for other items in the kitchen. The ingredients available are a raw yellow potato, a yellow onion, a raw purple potato, a knife, a fridge, oven, and stove. They might need to collect more ingredients, like the potatoes, and then use the knife to prepare them. Alternatively, maybe the cookbook can be used to find the recipe steps. But since it's closed, maybe they need to find a way to open it, like using the knife or another tool. But the previous action was taking the onion, so the next step might be to take another ingredient, like a potato, and then use the cookbook to follow the recipe. Alternatively, check the fridge for more ingredients. But the user is in the kitchen, so maybe they need to look for the recipe steps in the cookbook once it's open. Wait, the user tried to open the cookbook but couldn't. Maybe the cookbook is a book that needs to be read, but in the game, maybe you have to use the 'read' command or something else. But the available actions are limited. The user has the onion, so maybe the next step is to take another ingredient, like a potato, then use the knife to cut it, and then cook it using the stove or oven. The goal is to cook a meal, so gathering ingredients and preparing them is the next step. So the next action should be to take another ingredient, like the raw yellow potato or purple potato. Let's check the items again: the counter has raw yellow potato, yellow onion, raw purple potato. The user already took the yellow onion, so maybe take the yellow potato next.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the game's instructions. They started in the living room, then went to the bedroom, then back to the living room, and finally reached the kitchen. In the kitchen, they took the cookbook, but couldn't open it. Then they took the yellow onion and a raw yellow potato. Now, they tried to cook the yellow onion but the game asked what they want to cook it with.

Hmm, the goal is to cook a delicious meal using the ingredients from the kitchen. The user has the onion and a potato. The cookbook might have a recipe, but they couldn't open it. Maybe they need to find the recipe somehow. Alternatively, maybe they can use the ingredients they have to make a dish. Since the game is TextWorld, perhaps the next step is to use the ingredients they have. They have the onion and potato, so maybe they can cook a dish like a soup or a stir-fry. But the game might require specific actions. The previous action was trying to cook the onion, but they need to specify what to cook it with. Maybe they need to use the potato as a ingredient. So the next step would be to use the potato with the onion. Alternatively, maybe they need to find the recipe in the cookbook. But since they couldn't open it, maybe they need to look for another way. Wait, the user has the cookbook in their inventory? Or did they take it? Let me check the history.

The user took the cookbook from the table. Then tried to open it, but it wasn't possible. Then they took the onion and potato. Now, they are at the step where they need to cook the onion. The game is asking what to cook it with. So maybe they need to use the potato as a ingredient. So the next action would be to cook the onion with the potato. But how? Maybe the command is "cook onion with potato" or something similar. But the game might expect a specific command. Alternatively, maybe they need to use the stove. The stove is in the kitchen. So perhaps the correct action is to use the stove to cook the ingredients. But the user has to specify the ingredients. Since they have the onion and potato, maybe the next step is to cook them together. So the command would be "cook onion and potato" or "cook onion with potato". But the game might require a specific syntax. Alternatively, maybe they need to use the stove. The stove is conventional, so maybe the action is "use stove to cook onion and potato". But the user's previous action was "cook yellow onion", which led to the question of what to cook it with. So the next step is to specify the cooking method or the ingredients. Since they have the potato, they can use that. So the correct command would be to cook the onion with the potato. Therefore, the next action is "cook onion with potato".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal in this text-based game. The goal is to cook a delicious meal by checking the cookbook in the kitchen and then enjoying the meal. So far, they've moved through the living room, bedroom, and into the kitchen. They took the cookbook, but it wasn't openable. Then they took the yellow onion and a raw yellow potato. Now, they tried to cook the onion with the potato, but the system responded that cooking requires a source of heat.

Hmm, the next step would be to use the stove, which is mentioned in the kitchen description. The stove is conventional and appears to be empty. So maybe they need to put the ingredients on the stove and turn it on. But the user tried to cook the onion with the potato, and the system didn't accept that. Maybe they need to first put the ingredients on the stove, then turn it on. Alternatively, maybe they need to open the oven, but it's closed. Wait, the oven is closed, so maybe they need to open it first. But the user hasn't done that yet.

Wait, the user's last action was "cook onion with potato", which resulted in the system prompting for a heat source. So the next logical step is to use the stove. The stove is in the kitchen, so they should go to the stove, put the ingredients on it, and then turn it on. But how to phrase that in the game's commands? The user might need to "put onion and potato on stove" and then "turn stove on". But the game might require specific commands. Alternatively, maybe they need to "light stove" or "turn stove on". Since the stove is conventional, maybe the correct action is to "use stove" or "light stove".

But the user's previous action was cooking, which didn't work. So the next step is to use the stove as the heat source. Therefore, the correct command would be to go to the stove and use it. But the user is already in the kitchen. So the next action should be to "use stove" or "light stove". However, the game might require specific verbs. Let me check the previous interactions. The user tried to cook the onion with the potato, but the system said cooking requires heat. So the next step is to provide the heat source, which is the stove. Therefore, the correct action is to "light stove" or "turn stove on".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal in this TextWorld game. The goal is to check the cookbook in the kitchen for a recipe and then enjoy the meal. So far, they've navigated through the living room, bedroom, and into the kitchen. They took the cookbook, but couldn't open it. Then they picked up a yellow onion and a raw yellow potato. Now, they tried to cook the onion with the potato, but the stove isn't working.

The last action was trying to "turn on stove," but it wasn't possible. The stove is conventional but appears empty. The user needs to find a way to use the stove to cook the ingredients. Since the stove isn't switchable, maybe they need to use the oven? The oven is closed, so they might need to open it. Alternatively, maybe they can use the ingredients directly on the stove once it's lit. But how to light it? The previous attempt to "light stove" failed. Maybe the correct action is to "light the stove" or "ignite the stove." Alternatively, since the stove is conventional, perhaps they need to put the ingredients on it and then light it. But the user hasn't put the potato and onion on the stove yet. So the next step might be to place the ingredients on the stove and then try to light it. However, the game might require specific actions. Since the user has the onion and potato, they need to use them in the cooking process. The next action should be to put the onion and potato on the stove and then light it. But the previous attempt to light the stove didn't work. Maybe the correct action is to "put onion and potato on stove" and then "light stove." But the user can only input one command at a time. The last action was "turn on stove," which didn't work. So the next step is to try a different action, like "light stove" again, but maybe using a different verb. Alternatively, since the stove is conventional, maybe the user needs to "use stove" or "cook with stove." But the game might require specific commands. The user has the ingredients, so the next step is to cook them using the stove. The correct action here is probably "cook onion and potato on stove," but the game might require "light stove" again. However, since that failed, maybe the user needs to find another way. Alternatively, the oven might be the way to go. The oven is closed, so the user needs to open it first. But the goal is to cook the meal, so maybe using the oven is the next step. But the user is in the kitchen, and the oven is closed. So the next action should be to open the oven. But the user's previous actions were about the stove. So the correct next step is to try to light the stove again, but using a different verb. Alternatively, the user might need to "put onion and potato on stove" and then "light stove." But the user can only input one command. The previous attempt was "turn on stove," which didn't work.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal in the kitchen. They've taken the cookbook, yellow onion, and raw yellow potato. The goal is to follow the recipe from the cookbook to cook a meal.

Earlier attempts to light the stove didn't work. The stove is conventional but seems to require turning on, but the user tried "light stove" and "turn on stove," both failing. Now, the user is stuck again.

Need to think of alternative ways to use the stove. Maybe the stove is a gas stove, so turning it on might involve a knob. Or maybe the oven needs to be used. Wait, the oven is closed. Maybe the user needs to open it first? But the goal is to cook, so perhaps using the stove's burners.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the stove's controls. Since "turn on stove" didn't work, maybe "turn on the stove" with a preposition. Or "activate stove." But the system says "It isn't something you can switch." So maybe the stove is electric and needs a different action.

Wait, the user has the potato and onion. Maybe they need to cook them on the stove. But the stove is empty. So perhaps the next step is to put the ingredients on the stove. But the user hasn't done that yet.

Alternatively, maybe the oven can be used. The user has a cookbook, so maybe the recipe requires using the oven. But the oven is closed. So the user needs to open it first. Let me check the previous steps. The user is in the kitchen, and the oven is closed. So the next logical step would be to open the oven, then put the ingredients in, then cook.

But the user's last action was trying to light the stove again. Since that didn't work, maybe the correct approach is to open the oven instead. The user hasn't interacted with the oven yet. So the next step should be to open the oven, then proceed with the recipe.

Next, they tried to cook the onion with the potato, but the game mentioned they needed a heat source. They tried lighting the stove, but that didn't work.

However, since they already put the onion in the oven, the next logical step is to close the oven and maybe wait for it to cook. But the user has to give a command. The previous action was putting the onion in the oven, so the next step would be to close it or turn it on. But the oven was already opened, so maybe they need to close it and then heat it. However, the game might have specific commands. Since the user can't use "light stove" anymore, maybe they need to use the oven's function. The correct next step would be to close the oven and then maybe wait, but the game might require an action like "put potato in oven" as well. Wait, the user already put the onion in. Maybe they need to add the potato. But the user has the potato in their inventory. So the next step is to put the potato in the oven with the onion. Then, after cooking, they can take it out and enjoy the meal. But the current step is after putting the onion in the oven. So the next action should be to put the potato in the oven.

You are in a kitchen. An ordinary one.

Were you looking for a fridge? Because look over there, it's a fridge. You see an opened oven. The oven contains a raw yellow potato and a yellow onion. Classic TextWorld. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. You see a knife on the table. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. You see a raw purple potato on the counter. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.

There is a closed plain door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door.

FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to cook a meal using the cookbook in the kitchen. So far, they've taken the cookbook, but couldn't open it. Then they picked up some vegetables: a yellow onion and a yellow potato. They tried to cook them but faced issues with the stove. Then they put both vegetables in the oven, closed it, and opened it again. Now, the oven is open again, and the vegetables are still raw.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the kitchen, and the oven is open. The next step would be to check if the vegetables are cooked. But since the oven was just opened, maybe they need to wait for them to cook. However, in TextWorld, sometimes you have to take actions even if it seems like waiting. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the stove now that the oven is open. But the stove is empty. Wait, there's a knife on the table and a purple potato on the counter. Maybe the user needs to cook the vegetables using the stove instead of the oven. But the stove is empty. They might need to put the vegetables on the stove. But the previous attempts to light the stove didn't work. Maybe the user needs to use the knife to cut the vegetables, but that's not mentioned in the game's feedback. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to take the purple potato and use it with the onions and potatoes. But the goal is to cook a meal, so perhaps the user needs to cook the vegetables using the stove or oven. Since the oven is open, maybe they need to take the vegetables out and cook them on the stove. But the stove is empty. The user has already put the vegetables in the oven, but they're still raw. Maybe the oven isn't working, so the user needs to try the stove. But how? The user tried to light the stove but couldn't. Maybe the correct action is to put the vegetables on the stove. Alternatively, since the oven is open, maybe the user needs to take the vegetables out and use the stove. But the previous attempts to light the stove failed. Wait, the user has the knife on the table. Maybe they need to use the knife to cut the vegetables, but that's not part of the cooking steps. Alternatively, the user might need to take the purple potato and use it with the onions and potatoes. But the goal is to cook a meal, so the user needs to cook the vegetables. Since the oven is open, maybe the user needs to take the vegetables out and cook them on the stove. But the stove is empty. The user might need to put the vegetables on the stove. However, the previous attempts to light the stove didn't work. Maybe the correct action is to put the vegetables on the stove. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next step would be to put the vegetables on the stove. But the user has the yellow onion and yellow potato in the oven. Wait, the oven is open, so maybe the user needs to take them out. But the user hasn't done that yet. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the stove now. The user has the knife, so maybe they need to cut the vegetables.

But the previous attempts to light the stove failed. Maybe the correct action is to put the vegetables on the stove. So the next action would be to put the yellow onion and yellow potato on the stove. But the user has to take them from the oven first. Wait, the oven is open, so the user can take the vegetables out. So the steps would be: take the onion and potato from the oven, then put them on the stove. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action should be to take the vegetables from the oven. But the user is in the kitchen, and the oven is open. So the next action is to take the yellow onion and yellow potato from the oven. But the user has already put them in the oven. Wait, the oven is open, and the vegetables are inside. So the user needs to take them out. But the game's feedback says that the oven contains the raw vegetables. So the user needs to take them out. Then, maybe cook them on the stove. But the stove is empty. So the user needs to put them on the stove. But the stove is empty. So the next action is to take the vegetables from the oven, then put them on the stove. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next step is to take the vegetables from the oven. But the user is in the kitchen, and the oven is open. So the correct action is to take the yellow onion and yellow potato from the oven. But the user has to take them one by one. So the next action would be to take the yellow onion from the oven. But the user might need to take both. However, in the game, the user can only take one item at a time. So the next action is to take the yellow onion from the oven. Then, after that, take the yellow potato. Then, put them on the stove. But the stove is empty. So the user needs to put them on the stove. But the previous attempts to light the stove failed. Maybe the correct action is to put the vegetables on the stove. But the user needs to first take them from the oven. So the next action is to take the yellow onion from the oven. Then, after that, take the yellow potato. Then, put them on the stove. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action is to take the yellow onion from the oven.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal in this TextWorld game. The goal is to follow the cookbook recipe, so they need to gather ingredients and cook them.

First, they started by moving through the rooms: living room, bedroom, then kitchen. In the kitchen, they found a cookbook, some vegetables, and a stove. They took the cookbook, but couldn't open it. Then they took the onion and potato, tried to cook them but had issues with the stove. They opened the oven, put the veggies in, took them out again, and now they've taken the onion from the oven.

Now, the next step would be to take the potato from the oven, but the user just took the onion. Wait, the oven has both the yellow onion and the yellow potato. The user took the onion, so the potato is still in the oven. So the next action should be to take the potato from the oven. But the user's last action was taking the onion, so maybe they need to take the potato next. Then, after getting both ingredients, they might need to cook them using the stove. But the stove wasn't working earlier. Alternatively, maybe they need to use the oven again. But the oven is already open. Hmm.

Wait, the user's current location is the kitchen, and the oven is open with the potato and onion. They took the onion, so the potato is still there. So the next step is to take the potato from the oven. Then, maybe use the stove to cook them. But the stove was empty. So perhaps after taking both veggies, they can put them on the stove. But the user might need to use the stove's heat. Alternatively, maybe the recipe requires using the oven again. But the oven is already open. Maybe the user needs to cook the vegetables in the oven. But they already took the onion out. Wait, the goal is to cook a meal, so maybe after taking both ingredients, they can cook them. But the user is stuck in a loop of taking items from the oven. So the next action should be to take the potato from the oven. Then, maybe cook it. But the user has to follow the recipe. The cookbook was taken but not opened. Maybe the recipe is in the cookbook, but the user can't open it. So perhaps the user needs to find another way. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the stove. But the stove wasn't working before. Wait, the user tried to light the stove but it wasn't possible. So maybe the correct action is to take the potato from the oven, then use the stove. But how? Maybe the user needs to put the potato on the stove. But the stove is empty. So the next step is to take the potato from the oven, then put it on the stove. But the user hasn't done that yet.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal in this TextWorld game. The goal is to follow the cookbook's recipe, which they found in the kitchen. So far, they've taken ingredients like the yellow onion, yellow potato, and raw purple potato. They put two of them in the oven, took them out, and now they have the onions and potatoes.

Wait, the recipe might require specific steps. The user needs to cook the ingredients properly. Since the oven is already opened and they took the potatoes out, maybe they need to use the stove now. The stove is conventional but empty. They have a knife on the table. Maybe they need to chop the vegetables before cooking?

But the game's feedback after taking the potatoes from the oven says they have them. The next step would be to use the stove. The user tried to light the stove before but it didn't work. Maybe they need to use the knife to prepare the ingredients. Alternatively, maybe they need to put the potatoes on the stove to cook them.

Wait, the initial goal was to cook a meal by checking the cookbook. The user has the ingredients but hasn't actually cooked anything yet. The oven was used, but maybe the stove is the right place. Since the stove is empty, they might need to place the potatoes there. But how to make it work? The previous attempt to light the stove failed. Maybe the correct action is to put the potatoes on the stove instead of trying to light it.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the knife to cut the potatoes, then put them on the stove. But the game might require specific commands. Since the user has the ingredients, the next step is to cook them using the stove. So the correct action would be to put the potatoes on the stove. Let me check the previous steps again.

The user took the onions and potatoes from the oven. Now, they need to cook them. The stove is available. So the next step is to put the potatoes on the stove. The command would be "put yellow potato on stove" or similar. But the game might require using the correct syntax. Since the stove is conventional, maybe just putting the potato there would work. So the next action is to put the potato on the stove.

They took the yellow onion and yellow potato, then tried to cook them. They put both in the oven, but when they opened it, the ingredients were still raw. Then they took them out and tried to cook the potato on the stove. Now, they need to actually cook the potato on the stove. 

The next step would be to light the stove or turn it on. But earlier attempts to light the stove failed. Maybe they need to use the knife from the table to cut the potato before cooking? Or maybe they need to wait for the stove to heat up. Since the stove is conventional, perhaps they need to turn it on properly. 

Wait, the user tried "light stove" before, but it didn't work. Maybe the correct action is "turn on stove" or "heat stove". Alternatively, since the stove is conventional, maybe they need to use the knife to prepare the potato. But the goal is to cook a meal, so the main thing is to cook the potato on the stove. 

The user just put the potato on the stove, so the next step is to light it. But since "light stove" didn't work, maybe they need to use a different verb. Maybe "turn on stove" or "activate stove". Alternatively, since the stove is conventional, maybe they need to use the knife to cut the potato first. But the recipe might require cooking it directly. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to take the knife and cut the potato before putting it on the stove. But the user hasn't taken the knife yet. So the next step could be taking the knife, then cutting the potato, then putting it on the stove. But the user's last action was putting the potato on the stove. So perhaps the next step is to light the stove properly. 

But the previous attempt to light the stove failed. Maybe the correct action is "turn on stove" instead of "light stove". Let me check the previous interactions. The user tried "light stove" and got a response that it would achieve little. Then they tried "turn on stove" and it wasn't something you can switch. So maybe the correct action is to use the knife to cut the potato, then put it on the stove. 

Alternatively, since the stove is conventional, maybe they need to use the knife to prepare the potato. So the next action should be taking the knife and cutting the potato. But the user hasn't taken the knife yet. So the next step is to take the knife from the table. Then cut the potato. Then put it on the stove. But the user's last action was putting the potato on the stove. So maybe the next step is to use the knife to cut the potato. 

Wait, the user has the potato on the stove. Maybe they need to cook it. But how? The stove is empty, so maybe they need to light it. But previous attempts failed. Maybe the correct action is to "turn on stove" again, even though it said it's not something you can switch. Maybe the game expects that action. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to take the knife and cut the potato, then put it on the stove. But the user already put the potato on the stove. So maybe the next step is to use the knife to cut the potato. Let me check the available items. The user has the knife on the table. So the next action should be taking the knife, then cutting the potato. 

But the user hasn't taken the knife yet. So the next step is to take the knife. Then cut the potato. Then put it on the stove. But the user already put the potato on the stove. So maybe the correct next action is to take the knife and cut the potato. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to cook the potato by using the stove. Since the stove is conventional, maybe they need to turn it on. But the previous attempts didn't work. Maybe the correct action is to "use stove" or "cook potato on stove". But the game might require specific commands. 

Given the previous failures, maybe the next step is to take the knife and cut the potato, then put it on the stove. But the user already put the potato on the stove. So the next action should be taking the knife. 

So the next command should be "take knife from table" or "take knife". Then cut the potato. Then cook it. But the user hasn't taken the knife yet. So the next step is to take the knife.

Wait, the recipe probably requires cutting the potato. The knife is now in their inventory. So the next logical step would be to cut the potato with the knife.

So far, they've taken some ingredients from the kitchen, like the yellow onion, yellow potato, and even a knife. They tried to cut the potato with the knife but got an error saying they can't see any such thing.

Hmm, maybe the knife isn't useful for cutting here. Wait, the user has the potato on the stove. Maybe they need to cook it instead of cutting it? But the recipe probably requires cutting the potato. Alternatively, maybe the knife is for something else, like preparing the onion. But the user tried to cut the potato and failed. 

Wait, the oven was opened earlier, and there's a raw purple potato on the counter. Maybe the user needs to use that instead? Or perhaps the stove is the right place to cook the potato after cutting. But since cutting failed, maybe they need to find another way. Alternatively, maybe the stove is already hot, and they can just put the potato on it to cook. But the user already put the potato on the stove. 

Wait, the stove is conventional, so maybe they need to light it? But earlier attempts to light the stove were unsuccessful. The user tried "light stove" and "turn on stove," but those didn't work. Maybe the stove is electric, and they need to use a different command. Or maybe the stove is already on, and they just need to place the potato on it. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the oven again. They have the potato and onion, maybe they can bake them. But the oven was already used. The user has the knife, but can't cut. Maybe the knife is for something else, like preparing the onion. But the user hasn't touched the onion yet. 

Wait, the goal is to cook a meal, so maybe the user just needs to cook the ingredients they have. Since they have the potato on the stove, maybe they can just leave it there to cook. But the game might require specific actions. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the stove's heat to cook the potato. 

But the user is stuck because they can't cut the potato. Maybe they need to find another way to prepare it. Or perhaps the game expects them to use the stove directly without cutting. Maybe the potato is already ready to cook. 

Alternatively, maybe the user should try to cook the onion first. They have the onion from the oven. Maybe they can put it on the stove as well. But the user's last action was trying to cut the potato. Since that failed, maybe the next step is to try cooking the potato on the stove without cutting it. 

So the next action should be to cook the potato on the stove. The command would be "cook potato on stove" or something similar. But the game might require a specific phrasing. Alternatively, since the stove is conventional, maybe "put potato on stove" again, but they already did that. 

Wait, the user has the potato on the stove. Maybe they need to wait for it to cook, but the game might require an action. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the oven again. But the oven is already open. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the knife on the onion instead of the potato. But the user tried cutting the potato. Maybe the correct action is to use the knife on the onion. But the user hasn't tried that yet. 

But the user's last action was cutting the potato, which failed. So the next step is to try a different action. Maybe "cook potato on stove" or "put onion on stove". Since the goal is to cook a meal, maybe the user should try cooking the onion now. 

So the next command would be "cook onion on stove" or "put onion on stove". But the user already has the onion from the oven. Wait, the user took the onion from the oven, so they have it. Maybe they can put it on the stove to cook. 

Alternatively, since the stove is conventional, maybe the user just needs to put the potato on it and let it cook. But the game might require an action. 

In any case, the user is stuck because they can't cut the potato. So the next step is to try a different action, like cooking the onion or the potato directly. The correct command would be to cook the potato on the stove, even if it's not cut. So the next action is "cook potato on stove".

Wait, the user just tried "cook yellow potato on stove" but the game said they need to take the potato first. But they already put the yellow potato on the stove.

However, the stove is conventional and empty, so maybe they need to light it or use the oven again. But the oven is already open. Alternatively, maybe they need to use the knife to cut the potato again, but that didn't work before. Hmm.

Wait, the user is trying to cook the potato on the stove. The stove is conventional and empty. Maybe they need to light the stove. But earlier attempts to light it failed. Alternatively, maybe they need to put the potato into the stove. But the stove is empty. Wait, the user put the potato on the stove, so maybe the next step is to cook it. But how? Maybe the game expects them to use the stove's heat. Since the stove is conventional, perhaps they need to turn it on. But the user tried "turn on stove" earlier and it didn't work. Maybe the correct action is to use the stove's elements. Alternatively, maybe they need to use the oven again. But the oven is already open. 

Alternatively, since the user has the knife, maybe they need to cut the potato again, but that didn't work before. Or maybe they need to use the stove's burners. But the game might require a specific command. Since the user is stuck, maybe the next action is to try cooking the potato on the stove again, even though they put it there. Or perhaps they need to use the stove's heat. But the game might not accept "cook" as a command. Maybe the correct action is to "put the potato in the stove" or "cook the potato on the stove". But the user tried "cook yellow potato on stove" and got an error. So maybe the correct action is to "put the yellow potato in the stove" or "put the potato on the stove" again. But they already did that. Alternatively, maybe they need to use the oven again. But the oven is open. 

Wait, the user is in the kitchen, and the stove is conventional and empty. The potato is on the stove. Maybe the next step is to cook it by using the stove's heat. But the game might require a specific action. Since the user tried "cook" and got an error, maybe the correct action is to "light the stove" or "turn on the stove". But earlier attempts to do that failed. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the oven again. But the oven is already open. 

Alternatively, since the user has the knife, maybe they need to cut the potato again, but that didn't work. But the user is stuck. The game's goal is to cook a meal, so maybe the next step is to use the stove to cook the potato. Since the potato is on the stove, maybe the correct action is to "cook the potato on the stove" again, even though it's already there. But the game might require a different command. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the oven again. But the oven is open. 

Hmm, maybe the user needs to take the potato from the stove and put it in the oven again. But that seems redundant. Alternatively, the user might need to use the stove's heat to cook the potato. Since the stove is conventional, maybe the correct action is to "cook the potato on the stove". But the game might not accept that. Alternatively, the user might need to "use the stove to cook the potato". But the game's response was confusing. 

Given the previous steps, the user has the potato on the stove. The next logical step is to cook it. Even though the game said "You need to take the yellow potato first", but the potato is already on the stove. Maybe the user needs to "cook the potato on the stove" again. So the next action is "cook yellow potato on stove".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal in this TextWorld game. The goal is to follow the cookbook recipe, so they need to gather ingredients and cook them.

First, they started by moving through the rooms: living room, bedroom, then kitchen. In the kitchen, they found a cookbook, some vegetables, and a knife. They took the cookbook, but couldn't open it, so maybe they needed to use the ingredients from the cookbook.

They took the yellow onion and yellow potato, put them in the oven, then took them out. Now they have the potatoes and onion, but need to cook them properly. They tried using the stove but had issues with the knife. The last attempt was to cook the yellow potato on the stove, but the system said they needed to take the potato first. Wait, they already took the potato earlier, right? Maybe they have it in their inventory.

Wait, the current prompt says "You need to take the yellow potato first." But they already took it. Maybe the potato is on the stove, so they need to pick it up again. Or maybe the stove is empty, so they need to put the potato on the stove first. The user tried "cook yellow potato on stove" again, but it's not working. Maybe the correct action is to put the potato on the stove, then use the stove to cook it. Since the stove is conventional, maybe they need to turn it on or use it directly. But earlier attempts to light the stove failed. Alternatively, maybe the oven is the right place, but they already used the oven. Hmm.

The user is stuck because they can't proceed. The next step should be to use the stove properly. Since they have the potato, they need to put it on the stove and then cook it. The error message says they need to take the potato first, but they already did. Maybe the potato is on the stove, so they need to pick it up again. Or maybe the correct action is to cook it on the stove now. The previous attempt to cook it was unsuccessful, so maybe the correct command is "put yellow potato on stove" again. But they already did that. Wait, in the history, they put the potato on the stove, but maybe it's not on the stove anymore. Let me check the history.

Looking back: The user put the yellow potato on the stove (step 22), then took the knife, tried to cut it, which failed. Then tried to cook it again, but the system said they needed to take the potato first. So maybe the potato is not in their inventory anymore. Wait, no, they took it from the oven earlier. Wait, the user took the potato from the oven (step 21), then put it on the stove (step 22). Then they tried to cook it, but the system said they needed to take it first. That suggests that the potato is on the stove, so they need to pick it up again. But the user can't pick it up because it's on the stove. Alternatively, maybe the correct action is to use the stove to cook it now. Since the stove is conventional, maybe they can just cook it there. The error message is confusing, but the next step is to cook the potato on the stove. The user should try "cook yellow potato on stove" again, but the system is blocking it. Alternatively, maybe the correct action is to "put yellow potato on stove" again, but they already did that. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the knife to cut the potato before cooking. But earlier, when they tried to cut it, the system said they couldn't. Maybe the knife is not in the right place, or the potato isn't in the right place. Wait, the user took the knife from the table (step 23), so it's in their inventory. Then they tried to cut the potato with the knife, but the system said they can't. Maybe the potato is on the stove, so they need to pick it up first. So the correct action would be to take the potato from the stove, then cut it with the knife, then put it back on the stove to cook. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next step is to take the potato from the stove, then cut it, then cook it. But the user is stuck in a loop here. The system is not allowing them to proceed. The next action should be to take the potato from the stove, but the user hasn't done that yet. So the correct command would be "take yellow potato from stove" to pick it up again, then cut it with the knife, then put it on the stove to cook. But the user is at step 25, and the system is not allowing them to proceed. So the next action should be to take the potato from the stove.

Wait, the current step is that they took the yellow potato from the stove. Now, the next logical step would be to use the knife to cut the potato, but earlier when they tried "cut potato with knife," it didn't work.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal in the kitchen. They've already taken some ingredients like the onion, potatoes, and a knife. The goal is to follow the cookbook recipe, so they need to cook the ingredients properly.

The last action was trying to cook both the onion and potato on the stove, but the system said they can't use multiple objects with that verb. So, maybe they need to cook them one at a time. 

Looking at the current state, the user has the yellow potato on the stove and the onion. They might need to cook the onion first, then the potato, or vice versa. Alternatively, maybe they need to use the stove correctly. The stove is conventional, so perhaps they need to put the potato on the stove and then cook it, then do the same with the onion. But the system said they can't use multiple objects with "cook," so they have to do it step by step.

The next step would be to cook the onion first. Since the onion is already in the oven? Wait, no, earlier they took the onion from the oven. Wait, the oven had the raw onion and potato, then they took them out. Now, the onion is in the user's inventory. So maybe they need to put the onion on the stove and cook it. But the stove is empty. Wait, the user put the yellow potato on the stove earlier. So maybe the stove has the potato, and the onion is separate. 

So the user needs to cook the onion. The correct action would be to put the onion on the stove, then cook it. But the previous attempt to cook both failed. So the next step is to cook the onion alone. The command would be "cook onion on stove" or "put onion on stove" followed by "cook onion." But the system might accept "cook onion on stove" even if it's just one item. Alternatively, maybe "cook onion" without specifying the stove, but the stove is the only heat source. 

So the next action should be to cook the onion on the stove. The user has the onion in their inventory, so they need to put it on the stove first. Wait, but the stove is already having the potato. Maybe the user needs to take the potato off the stove first? Or maybe the stove can handle multiple items. But the system said they can't use multiple objects with "cook." So perhaps the user should cook the onion first, then the potato. 

So the next action is to cook the onion on the stove. The correct command would be "cook onion on stove." Let me check the previous steps. The user tried "cook onion and potato on stove" which failed. So now, they need to cook one at a time. Therefore, the next step is to cook the onion.
