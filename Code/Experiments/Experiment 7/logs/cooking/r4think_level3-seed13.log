You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

You've just walked into a kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

You see a fridge. The fridge contains a yellow onion, a raw white tuna, a white onion, a raw red tuna, a yellow bell pepper, a red onion and a red bell pepper. Now why would someone leave that there? You can make out an oven. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. You scan the room, seeing a table. The table is massive. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a yellow apple, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let me try to figure out what to do next. The user is trying to cook a meal using the recipe from the cookbook. The recipe requires chopping the white tuna, but they need a knife for that. They already picked up the cookbook and tried to open it, which worked. Now, they have the cookbook and the knife on the counter.

Wait, the user has the knife, right? The counter has a knife. So the next step should be to use the knife to chop the white tuna. But the user tried "chop white tuna" and the system said they need a knife. So maybe they need to pick up the knife first? But the knife is already on the counter. Oh, maybe they haven't picked it up yet. So the correct sequence is: pick up the knife, then chop the white tuna. But the user hasn't done that yet. Let me check the previous steps.

The user picked up the cookbook, then tried to open it, which worked. Then they tried to chop the white tuna, but the system said they need a knife. So the user hasn't picked up the knife yet. So the next step should be to pick up the knife first. Then, after picking up the knife, they can chop the white tuna. So the next action should be "pick up knife" before chopping.

Okay, let's break this down. The goal is to cook a meal using the recipe from the cookbook. The recipe requires chopping the white tuna, but the user is having trouble because they need a knife. They already picked up the knife, but maybe they didn't use it correctly.

Looking at the previous actions: the user picked up the cookbook, then the knife. Then they tried to chop the white tuna, but the system said cutting requires a knife. Then they tried "use knife on white tuna," which wasn't recognized. So maybe the correct action is to chop the white tuna with the knife. But the system doesn't recognize "use knife on" as a valid command. Maybe the correct verb is "chop" again, but the system is prompting for a knife. Wait, the user already has the knife. So perhaps the next step is to chop the white tuna again, but the system is still not accepting it. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "cut" the white tuna with the knife. But the recipe says "chop," so maybe the system is expecting "chop" even though the knife is available. The user might be stuck in a loop because they tried "chop" but the system says a knife is needed, but they already have the knife. So the next action should be to chop the white tuna again, even though the system is prompting for a knife. Maybe the system is not recognizing that the knife is in hand. So the correct command is "chop white tuna" again.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to chop the white tuna but keeps getting errors. They have the knife now. The previous attempt was "use knife on white tuna," which wasn't recognized. Maybe the correct command is just "chop white tuna" again, since the system might not be recognizing the knife usage. Alternatively, maybe "cut white tuna" is the correct verb. But the recipe says "chop," so maybe the system expects "chop." The user is stuck in a loop where they can't proceed. The next step is to try "chop white tuna" again, even though the system says a knife is needed. Maybe the system is not acknowledging that the knife is in hand. So the correct action is to chop the white tuna again.
