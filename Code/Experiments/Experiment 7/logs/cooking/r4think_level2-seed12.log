You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. A typical kind of place. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."

What's that over there? It looks like it's a fridge. The fridge contains a raw red tuna, a red onion and a raw white tuna. You see an oven. You scan the room, seeing a table. On the table you make out a cookbook. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a tomato, a red hot pepper and a knife. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You smell a sickening smell, and follow it to a stove. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let me try to figure out what to do next. The user is trying to cook a meal using the ingredients from the kitchen. The recipe requires slicing the red tuna and the tomato, then roasting them. So far, the user has looked at the cookbook, found the recipe, and tried to slice the red tuna. But they couldn't because they didn't have a knife. Wait, the knife is on the counter, right? The user has the knife now, so maybe they need to use it on the red tuna.

Wait, the user tried to slice the red tuna but got an error. Then they used the knife on the red tuna, but the system said that's not a verb. Oh, maybe the correct action is to slice the tuna with the knife. But the previous attempt was "use the knife on the red tuna," which didn't work. Maybe the correct command is "slice the red tuna with the knife" or "cut the red tuna with the knife." Alternatively, maybe the knife is already in hand, so just slicing the tuna would work. But the system said "Cutting something requires a knife," so the user needs to use the knife. Maybe the correct action is "use the knife to slice the red tuna." Let me check the previous steps again.

The user has the knife on the counter. So the next step is to use the knife to slice the red tuna. The previous attempt was "use the knife on the red tuna," which didn't work. Maybe the correct verb is "slice" instead of "use." So the next action should be "slice the red tuna with the knife" or "cut the red tuna with the knife." But the system might accept "slice the red tuna" if the knife is already in hand. Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "use the knife to slice the red tuna." Let me try that.

Okay, let's break this down. The goal is to cook a meal using the recipe from the cookbook. The recipe requires slicing the red tuna and the tomato, then roasting them. So far, the user has taken the red tuna from the fridge but hasn't taken the knife yet. The previous attempt to slice the tuna failed because the knife wasn't used. Now, the user needs to take the knife first before slicing.

Wait, the user just tried to slice the tuna but was told to take the knife first. So the next step is to take the knife from the counter. Then, after taking the knife, they can slice the tuna. The user might have forgotten to take the knife first. So the correct action now is to take the knife. Then, once the knife is in hand, slice the tuna. The user needs to make sure they have both the tuna and the knife before attempting to slice. So the next command should be "take the knife".

Okay, let's break this down. The user is trying to follow the recipe to cook a meal. The recipe says to roast the red tuna after slicing it. The user has already sliced the red tuna and the tomato. Now, the next step is to roast them. But the user tried "roast the red tuna" and it didn't work. Then they tried "roast the red tuna with the oven," which also didn't work. So maybe the correct verb is "put in the oven" or "place in the oven." Alternatively, maybe "roast" is the correct verb, but they need to use the oven. Wait, the stove is conventional, but the oven is separate. So perhaps the action is to put the roasted tuna into the oven. But the recipe says "roast the red tuna," so maybe the user needs to use the oven to roast it. The correct command might be "put the red tuna in the oven" or "roast the red tuna using the oven." Since the system didn't recognize "roast," maybe the correct action is "put in the oven" with the tuna. So the next step is to put the red tuna in the oven.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to roast the red tuna and tomato in the oven. They've already put both into the oven. The recipe says to roast them. But the system isn't recognizing "roast" here. Maybe the correct action is to "turn on the oven" or "heat the oven." But the oven is already open. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the stove instead of the oven. Wait, the recipe says to roast, which usually requires an oven. But the stove is conventional. Maybe the user should use the stove to roast them. But the stove isn't equipped with anything. Hmm. The user has to follow the recipe's directions. The directions say "roast the red tuna" and "roast the tomato." Since the oven is open and the items are inside, maybe the next step is to "close the oven" to start roasting. But the oven was just opened. Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "start roasting" or "begin roasting." But the system doesn't recognize those. Wait, the user has to use the oven. Maybe the correct action is "put the red tuna and tomato in the oven" but that was already done. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "heat the oven" to roast them. But the oven is closed. Wait, the oven was opened, and the items are inside. So the next step is to close the oven and let them roast. But the user hasn't closed it yet.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's recap. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe. They've followed the steps: taken ingredients, sliced them, put them in the oven, closed it. Now, the meal is ready, but the system isn't recognizing "wait for the meal to cook" or "close the oven" as valid commands. The goal is to enjoy the meal, so maybe the final step is to take the cooked items out of the oven and serve them. But the user hasn't done that yet. The previous action was closing the oven, which might have completed the cooking process. Since the oven is closed and the meal is ready, the next step is to take the red tuna and tomato out of the oven. But the system might require a specific command like "take the red tuna from the oven" or "get the tomato from the oven." Alternatively, maybe "serve the meal" is the command. But the user needs to follow the recipe's directions. The recipe says "prepare meal," so maybe the correct action is "prepare the meal" or "serve the meal." However, the system might expect "take the red tuna and tomato from the oven" to finish the process. So the next command should be taking the ingredients from the oven.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe. The recipe requires slicing the red tuna and tomato, then roasting them. The user has already sliced both ingredients, put them in the oven, and closed it. Now, the meal is ready, but the user can't find the cooked items in the oven. The system isn't recognizing commands like "take from the oven" or "serve the meal." The goal is to enjoy the meal, so the next step must be to retrieve the cooked items from the oven. Since the oven is closed, maybe the user needs to open it again to take them out. But the oven was already closed. Alternatively, maybe the correct action is to "open the oven" again to get the tuna and tomato. But the user tried that earlier. Wait, the user closed the oven, and now the meal is ready. The system might expect the user to open the oven again to take the items out. So the next command should be "open the oven" to retrieve the cooked red tuna and tomato.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal. They followed the recipe: sliced the red tuna and tomato, put them in the oven, took them out. Now they have the ingredients. The next step is to prepare the meal. The system isn't recognizing "serve" or "enjoy" as verbs. Maybe the correct action is to "combine" the ingredients or "prepare the meal" by putting them together. Since the recipe says "prepare meal," maybe the user needs to use that exact phrase. But the system says it's not a verb. Alternatively, maybe the user just needs to "eat the meal" but that's not a verb either. Wait, the goal is to enjoy the meal, so maybe the final action is to "eat the meal" but the system doesn't recognize it.

Okay, let's recap. The user is in a kitchen trying to cook a meal. The recipe requires slicing red tuna and tomato, roasting them in the oven. The user has done all that: taken the ingredients, sliced them, put them in the oven, took them out. Now, they have the cooked items but can't proceed further. The system isn't recognizing commands like "serve" or "eat." The goal is to enjoy the meal. Since the user has the ingredients, the next step must be to consume them. But the system doesn't accept "eat" or "serve." Maybe the correct action is to "combine" the ingredients into a meal. Alternatively, since the recipe says "prepare meal," maybe that's the command. But the system says it's not a verb. The user has to find a synonym. Maybe "prepare the meal" is the correct command even if it's not a verb. Alternatively, "finish the meal" or "complete the meal." But the system might expect "eat" despite the error. Since the user can't see the meal, maybe they need to "consume the meal" or "take the meal." But the system says "You can't see any such thing." So the final step is to take the ingredients and eat them. The correct command is "eat the meal" even if it's not recognized. Alternatively, the game might consider the meal as prepared, so the user wins by completing the steps. But the system is strict. The user has to use the exact command. The previous steps were correct, so maybe the game is done, and the user wins. But the score is still 4/18. Wait, the user has completed all steps: sliced, roasted, taken out. The next step is to enjoy. Since the system doesn't recognize "enjoy," maybe the correct action is to "take the meal" or "serve it." But the user has the ingredients. The answer is to "eat the meal" even if it's not a verb. So the next command is "eat the meal."
