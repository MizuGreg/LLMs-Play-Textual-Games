You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
Well, here we are in a kitchen. You begin looking for stuff.

You make out a fridge. The fridge contains a lettuce and a yellow bell pepper. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's an oven. Now that's what I call TextWorld! What's that over there? It looks like it's a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. Hey, want to see a counter? Look over there, a counter! The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a green hot pepper, a green apple, a yellow apple, an orange bell pepper, a yellow onion, a raw red potato and a cookbook. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

Okay, let me try to figure out what to do next. The user is in a kitchen game where they need to cook a meal using the recipe from the cookbook. The recipe requires chopping a green apple, frying it, slicing a green hot pepper, roasting it, dicing a yellow potato, frying it, and then preparing the meal.

So far, the user has taken the cookbook and read the recipe. The first step in the recipe is to chop the green apple. But when they tried to chop it, the game said they need a knife. Oh, right! There's a knife on the table. So the user probably forgot to take the knife first. 

Wait, the user's previous action was "chop green apple", which failed because they didn't have the knife. So the next logical step is to take the knife from the table. Once they have the knife, they can then chop the green apple. After that, they can proceed with the other steps like frying, slicing, etc. 

But the user might be stuck in a loop because they tried to chop the apple without the knife. So the solution is to first take the knife, then use it to chop the apple. Then continue with the recipe steps. The next action should be taking the knife.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe in the cookbook. The recipe requires chopping a green apple, frying it, slicing a green hot pepper, roasting it, dicing a yellow potato, frying it, and then preparing the meal.

So far, the user has taken the cookbook, read the recipe, taken the knife, and now the green apple. The next step is to chop the green apple using the knife. But the game says "Cutting something requires a knife," which is already taken. Wait, the user just took the green apple, so now they need to chop it. The previous attempt was "chop green apple," which failed because the knife wasn't used. Then they tried "chop green apple with knife," which was incorrect. Now they've taken the apple, so the correct action is to chop it with the knife. But the game might require specifying the knife. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the knife on the apple. Let me check the previous steps again.

The user took the knife and the green apple. Now, the next step is to chop the apple. The correct command would be "chop green apple with knife" or "cut green apple with knife." Since the game previously rejected "chop green apple with knife," maybe the correct syntax is "cut green apple with knife." Alternatively, maybe just "cut green apple" after taking the knife. But the user needs to make sure the knife is in hand. Since the user has the knife and the apple, the next action is to chop the apple. The game might accept "cut green apple" now that the knife is available. Let me try that.

You need to specify how you want to cut the green apple. Either slice, dice, or chop it.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based kitchen game where they need to follow a recipe to cook a meal. The goal is to gather ingredients and follow the directions to prepare the meal. So far, they've taken the cookbook, read the recipe, taken the knife, the green apple, and now they've chopped the green apple. The next steps according to the recipe are to fry the green apple, slice the green hot pepper, roast the green hot pepper, dice the yellow potato, fry the yellow potato, and then prepare the meal.

The user's current action was chopping the green apple, which was successful. Now, the next step is to fry the green apple. But the user needs to check if they have the necessary tools. The recipe says to fry the apple, so they might need a pan or stove. However, in the kitchen description, there's a stove, but it's empty. The user might need to use the stove to fry the apple. So the next action should be to fry the green apple. But the game might require specifying the stove or using the correct verb. Alternatively, maybe "fry green apple" is sufficient. Let me check previous steps. The user has the knife and the apple, so frying should be possible. The next command would be "fry green apple".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to fry the green apple in the kitchen game. The previous attempts to use "fry green apple" didn't work. The game says "That's not a verb I recognise." So maybe the correct command is to use the stove. The recipe says to fry the apple, so the user needs to use the stove. The correct action might be "fry green apple on stove" or "use stove to fry green apple." But the game might expect a different phrasing. Alternatively, maybe "cook green apple" instead of "fry." But the recipe specifically says "fry." Hmm. The user has the green apple and the knife. The stove is in the room. So the next step is to use the stove to fry the apple. The correct command might be "fry green apple with stove" or "cook green apple on stove." But the game might accept "fry green apple" if the stove is implied. Wait, the user tried "fry green apple" and it didn't work. Maybe the correct verb is "heat" or "cook." Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "put green apple in stove" or "place green apple on stove." But the recipe says "fry," so perhaps the correct action is "fry green apple" but with the stove specified. Let me check the previous steps. The user is at the stove, so maybe "fry green apple" is correct. But the game says it's not a recognized verb. Maybe the correct command is "cook green apple" instead. Or "heat green apple." Alternatively, the user might need to "use stove to fry green apple." But the game might require a different syntax. Since the user is stuck, the next action should be to use the stove to fry the apple. The correct command is probably "fry green apple on stove" or "cook green apple on stove." But the game might accept "fry green apple" if the stove is in use. Alternatively, maybe "put green apple in stove" to start the frying process. Let me try "fry green apple on stove."

The user has the yellow potato on the counter. They need to take it first. Then, they need to dice it. But the game might require using the knife again. So the next action should be taking the yellow potato. Once they have it, they can dice it with the knife. The previous steps were successful, so the next command is "take yellow potato".

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, the user is trying to fry the yellow potato. They've tried "fry yellow potato" and "fry the yellow potato", but the game says "That's not a verb I recognise." So maybe the correct action is to use the stove again. The recipe says to fry the potato, so the user needs to use the stove. The correct command might be "cook yellow potato on stove" or "heat yellow potato in stove." Since "fry" isn't working, perhaps "cook" is the right verb. Alternatively, "put yellow potato in stove" to start the frying process. The previous steps showed that using the stove was necessary for frying. So the next action should be "cook yellow potato on stove" or similar.

Okay, the user is trying to prepare the meal. The game says "Something still needs to be cooked." So even though they followed all the steps, maybe there's one more thing left. Let me check the recipe again. The recipe says: chop the green apple, fry the green apple, slice the green hot pepper, roast the green hot pepper, dice the yellow potato, fry the yellow potato, and prepare the meal. The user has done all those steps. But the game says something is still needed. Maybe the green hot pepper needs to be roasted. Wait, the user sliced the green hot pepper, but the recipe says to roast it. Oh, right! The user sliced it, but roasting is different. So maybe they need to roast the green hot pepper instead of slicing. Let me check the previous steps. The user sliced the green hot pepper, but the recipe says to slice and then roast. So maybe the user missed the roasting step. So the next action should be to roast the green hot pepper. But how? The user has the knife, and the stove is available. So the correct command is "roast green hot pepper on stove" or similar.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to roast the green hot pepper. The game isn't recognizing "roast" as a verb. Maybe the correct action is to use the stove to cook it. The recipe says to roast the green hot pepper, so the user needs to use the stove. The previous attempts to use "roast" failed, so maybe the correct command is "cook green hot pepper on stove" or "heat green hot pepper in stove." Since "roast" isn't working, the user should try a different verb like "cook" or "heat." The next step is to use the stove to cook the green hot pepper.
