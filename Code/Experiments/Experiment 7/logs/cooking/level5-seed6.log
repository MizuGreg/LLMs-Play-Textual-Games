You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Bathroom =-
You arrive in a bathroom. A normal kind of place. You begin looking for stuff.

You see a toilet. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the toilet! oh well.

There is an exit to the west.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.

-= Kitchen =-
Look around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You make out an opened fridge. The fridge is empty! What a waste of a day! You can make out a closed oven. You can see a table. Now why would someone leave that there? The table is massive. On the table you can see a knife. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a yellow apple, a red apple, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper and a cookbook. You make out a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is an open frosted-glass door leading east. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door. There is an exit to the west.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe in the cookbook. The recipe requires chopping two apples and frying them. So the goal is to gather the ingredients, chop them, fry them, and prepare the meal.

Looking at the previous actions: the user took the cookbook, opened the fridge (but it was already open), looked around, and then tried to chop the red apple but forgot to take the knife. Then they took the knife from the table. Now, they're trying to chop the red apple again, but the system says "Cutting something requires a knife." Wait, maybe they didn't use the knife yet. Oh, right, they took the knife, so they should have it. But the error message says the knife is needed. Maybe the user hasn't picked up the knife yet? Wait, no, they just took the knife. Hmm.

Wait, the user took the knife from the table. So now they have the knife. Then they tried to chop the red apple again. The system says "Cutting something requires a knife." But they have the knife. Maybe the issue is that they need to use the knife on the apple. So the next step is to use the knife on the red apple. But the command was "chop red apple", which might not be correct. Maybe they need to "cut the red apple with the knife" or something similar. Alternatively, maybe the knife is on the table, and they need to pick it up again. Wait, no, they already took the knife. So the problem is that the system is not recognizing the knife as being in their inventory. Or maybe the command should be "cut the red apple with the knife". But the game might require a different phrasing.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to first use the knife on the apple. So the correct action is to chop the red apple using the knife. But the previous attempt to "chop red apple" didn't work because the knife wasn't used. So the next step is to use the knife on the apple. So the command should be "chop red apple with knife" or "cut red apple with knife". But the game might accept "chop red apple" if the knife is in hand. Wait, the user has the knife, so maybe the system is just not recognizing that. So the next action should be to chop the red apple again, but this time with the knife. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to first use the knife on the apple. So the correct command is "chop red apple" again, but the system is prompting for the knife. So the user needs to use the knife. Therefore, the next action is to chop the red apple with the knife. But the game might require a different command. So the answer is to chop the red apple again, but the system is not accepting it. Therefore, the user needs to use the knife, so the next action is "chop red apple with knife" or similar. But the game might require "cut the red apple with the knife". However, the user's previous command was "chop red apple", which failed. So the correct next step is to use the knife on the apple. Therefore, the next action is "chop red apple with knife".

Okay, let's break this down. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe. The recipe says to chop and fry two apples. So the goal is to gather the ingredients, chop them, fry them, and prepare the meal.

Looking at the past actions: The user took the cookbook, opened the fridge (which was already open), looked around, took the knife, chopped the red apple, and now is trying to fry it. But the system isn't recognizing "fry" as a verb. The user tried "fry red apple" multiple times, but it's not working. Then they tried "fry red apple with pan" and "fry red apple in pan", but still no luck.

So the problem is that the command "fry" isn't being recognized. Maybe the correct verb is "cook" or "sear" instead. Alternatively, the user might need to use the stove. The recipe says "fry the red apple", but the game might require a different phrasing. Maybe "fry the red apple on the stove" or "cook the red apple in the pan".

The next step is to find the right verb for frying. Since "fry" isn't working, perhaps "cook" or "sear" is the correct verb. Alternatively, the user might need to use the stove. The user has the knife and the red apple. They need to fry the apple, so maybe the correct command is "cook the red apple in the pan" or "sear the red apple on the stove".

But the user has to use the correct command that the game recognizes. Since "fry" isn't working, maybe "cook" is the synonym. So the next action should be "cook the red apple in the pan" or similar. Alternatively, "sear the red apple on the stove". The user needs to use the stove, which is in the kitchen. So the correct command might be "cook the red apple on the stove".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe. The recipe requires chopping two apples and frying them. So the goal is to gather the ingredients, chop them, fry them, and prepare the meal.

Looking at the past actions: The user took the cookbook, opened the fridge (which was already open), looked around, took the knife, chopped the red apple, fried it using the stove. Then took the yellow apple, cooked it on the stove, but then had to chop the yellow apple again because "something still needs to be cut". Now, after chopping the yellow apple, the next step is to fry it again. But the user tried "fry yellow apple on stove" and it didn't work. The system said "That's not a verb I recognise."

So the problem is that "fry" isn't working. The user tried "cook" earlier, which worked for the red apple. Maybe "cook" is the correct verb here. Alternatively, maybe "sear" or "sauté" is the right term. But the user has to use a command that the game recognizes. Since "fry" isn't working, maybe "cook" is the synonym. So the next action should be "cook the yellow apple on the stove" or "sear the yellow apple on the stove". But the user has to use the correct command. Since "cook" worked before, maybe that's the right verb here. So the next step is to cook the yellow apple on the stove.
