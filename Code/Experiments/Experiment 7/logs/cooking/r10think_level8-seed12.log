You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Bedroom =-
Well how about that, you are in the place we're calling the bedroom.

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a bed. The bed is large. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a sofa. The sofa is comfy. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.

On the counter you can see a tomato. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is a closed plain door leading south. There is an exit to the west.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal based on the cookbook. They've already gone through the kitchen, pantry, and back. The goal is to find the recipe in the cookbook, then use the ingredients to make a meal.

First, they took the cookbook from the table. Then they went south through the door, but that led them back to the kitchen. Now they're stuck in a loop between the kitchen and pantry. The problem is that the cookbook is in the kitchen, but they need to use it to find the recipe. Wait, maybe they need to check the cookbook again. But earlier, when they tried to open it, it wasn't possible. Oh, but they took it, so maybe they need to look at it now. But the game might require them to read the recipe, which would involve using the cookbook. However, the previous action was going south again, which loops them back. So the next step is to use the cookbook in the kitchen. Maybe the recipe is in the cookbook, so they need to read it. But how? The game might require them to 'read' the cookbook, but the available actions are limited. Alternatively, they need to find ingredients. The kitchen has a fridge, oven, stove, and a tomato on the counter. Maybe they need to take the tomato and use the stove. But the recipe isn't clear. Wait, the initial instruction said to check the cookbook for the recipe. So the key is to open the cookbook, but earlier it wasn't possible. Wait, maybe they need to open it again. But the user tried to open it and it wasn't possible. Wait, no, the user took the cookbook, so maybe they need to use it now. The next step is to read the recipe from the cookbook. But the game might require the action 'read cookbook' or something similar. However, the available actions are limited. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the ingredients from the kitchen. The tomato is on the counter, so take it. Then use the stove to cook it. But the recipe isn't specified. The goal is to cook a meal, so maybe the user needs to take the tomato, use the stove, and then eat it. But the game might require specific steps. Since the user is stuck in a loop, the next action should be to take the tomato from the counter. That would break the loop and proceed to cook.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to cook a meal using the cookbook. They've already taken the cookbook, picked up a tomato and a knife, but are stuck because they need to use the stove. The previous attempt to cook the tomato with the knife failed because cooking requires heat. The stove is available, so the next step should be to use the stove to cook the tomato. The correct action would be to put the tomato on the stove or use the stove to cook it. Since "use stove on tomato" wasn't recognized, maybe "put tomato on stove" is the right command. That should proceed with cooking.

They tried putting the tomato on the stove, but the game keeps saying "That's not a verb I recognise." So maybe the correct action is to use the stove to cook the tomato. But the previous attempts to use "cook" didn't work. Wait, maybe the correct command is "use stove on tomato" or "cook tomato with stove". But the game doesn't recognize those. Alternatively, since the tomato is on the stove, maybe the next step is to "eat tomato" to finish the meal. But the user needs to follow the steps correctly. The goal is to cook a meal, so after cooking, they should eat it. Let me check the previous steps again. The user put the tomato on the stove, then the game said they cooked it. But the last error was about a verb. Maybe the correct action is to "eat tomato" now. That would complete the meal. So the next command should be "eat tomato".

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out how to win this game. The user's goal is to cook a meal using the cookbook. They've already found the cookbook, taken the tomato, and the knife. They tried putting the tomato on the stove but keep getting errors when trying to cook it.

First, the steps needed are: find the recipe in the cookbook, gather ingredients (tomato, knife), cook the tomato using the stove, and then eat it. But the game is having trouble recognizing the correct commands. The user has been looping between taking and putting the tomato on the stove, which isn't working.

The next step should be to actually cook the tomato. Since the game doesn't recognize "cook tomato", maybe the correct command is "use stove on tomato" or "cook with stove". But the user tried "cook tomato on stove" and it didn't work. Alternatively, maybe the correct action is to "eat tomato" once it's cooked. But the game keeps saying "take the tomato first" even after putting it on the stove. This suggests a loop where the user is repeatedly taking and putting the tomato, which isn't progressing. To break the loop, the user needs to find a different action, maybe using the knife to prepare the tomato before cooking. But the knife is already taken. Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "cook tomato" without any other actions, even though the game says to take it first. Since the tomato is on the stove, perhaps the game is expecting "cook" without specifying the item. But the user has to follow the game's recognized verbs. The correct command here is likely "cook tomato" even if the game says to take it first, because the tomato is already on the stove. So the next action should be "cook tomato".

Alternatively, the user might need to use the knife to prepare the tomato before cooking. But the knife is already taken. 

The next step should be to actually cook the tomato. Since the game keeps saying to take the tomato first, maybe the tomato is still in the user's inventory. The user took it from the stove, so maybe they need to put it back on the stove and then use the stove to cook it. But the game is not recognizing the "cook" command. Perhaps the correct action is to "use stove on tomato" or "cook tomato with stove". However, the user has to follow the game's recognized verbs.
