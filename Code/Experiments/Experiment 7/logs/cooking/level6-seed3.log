You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Bathroom =-
You are in a bathroom. You can barely contain your excitement.

If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a toilet. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a toilet, go to TextWorld. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

You need an exit without a door? You should try going east.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through these rooms to find the cookbook in the kitchen. The goal is to cook a meal, so they need to find the cookbook first.

Looking at the history, the user has been moving between the bathroom, corridor, bedroom, and back again. They kept going east, north, south, and back. It seems like they're stuck in a loop between the corridor and bedroom. The bathroom exit was east, but then the corridor has exits north, south, east, and west. The bedroom is connected back to the corridor. 

The user's past actions have been going east, north, south, and repeating. Since they're in a loop, the next step is to break the cycle. Maybe instead of going north again, they should try a different direction. The corridor has a west exit, but the user hasn't tried that yet. Alternatively, maybe there's another way to get to the kitchen. 

Wait, the initial instruction said to check the cookbook in the kitchen. So the user needs to get to the kitchen. But the current rooms are bathroom, corridor, bedroom. Maybe the kitchen is connected to the corridor. The user has been moving between corridor and bedroom, so perhaps they need to find another path. 

Since the user is in the corridor again, maybe trying west instead of north. The corridor's description says west is not blocked. So going west from the corridor might lead to another room, maybe the kitchen. Let's try that. The previous actions were repeating north and south, so changing direction to west could break the loop.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the corridor and bedroom. They keep going back and forth between them. The goal is to find the cookbook in the kitchen to cook a meal.

First, the goal is to reach the kitchen, check the cookbook, and then cook. But so far, the user has only been moving between bathroom, corridor, and bedroom. The kitchen hasn't been found yet.

Looking at the previous steps, the user tried going east from the bathroom, which led back to the corridor. Then they kept going north and south between corridor and bedroom. Now they're back at the corridor again.

The problem is the loop. The user needs to break the cycle. Instead of going north again, maybe try a different direction. The corridor has a west exit, but that leads back to the bathroom. The east exit is the same as before. Wait, maybe there's another way. But according to the descriptions, the corridor's exits are east, north, south, west. But the user hasn't explored other paths yet.

Wait, the initial bathroom had an exit east to corridor. The corridor's east exit is unblocked. Maybe the kitchen is connected to the east exit of the corridor? But the user hasn't tried going east from the corridor. Wait, in the previous steps, when in the corridor, the user went north, south, west, but never east. Maybe the east exit is the way to the kitchen. Let me check the history.

Looking back, when the user was in the corridor (0/13), they went north to bedroom. Then south back to corridor (0/14), then west to bathroom (0/15), then east back to corridor (0/16). So the east exit from the corridor hasn't been explored yet. Maybe that's the path to the kitchen. So the next step should be to go east from the corridor instead of continuing the loop.

You are in a kitchen. An usual one. Let's see what's in here.

You can see an opened fridge close by. The fridge contains a raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper, a raw white tuna, a yellow onion, a red bell pepper, a lettuce and a white onion. You make out a closed oven nearby. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You see a counter. On the counter you can make out a raw red potato, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a raw red tuna, a red hot pepper and a cookbook. What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.

There is an open frosted-glass door leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to cook a meal using the ingredients from the cookbook. They've already taken the pork chop, purple potato, and red potato. The next step is to cook them.

The user tried "cook pork chop with purple potato" but got an error. Then they tried "use stove" which wasn't recognized. Now they need to figure out the correct command. The stove is the heat source, so maybe they need to "put" the pork chop and potatoes on the stove. Alternatively, "heat" the ingredients. But the correct verb here is probably "put" since that's a common action in text games. So the next step is to put the pork chop and potatoes on the stove.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook the pork chop with the potatoes. They've already put the purple potato on the stove and the pork chop on the stove. Now they need to add the red potato. Wait, the recipe says to slice and fry both purple and red potatoes. But the user hasn't taken the red potato yet.

Looking at the previous steps, the user took the pork chop and purple potato. The red potato is still on the counter. So the next step is to take the red potato. Then, slice it according to the recipe. But the user might not have the knife yet. Wait, the knife is on the table. So they need to take the knife first, then slice the red potato. Then put it on the stove. But the recipe says to fry both potatoes. So after putting all three on the stove, maybe the cooking is done. But the user needs to follow the directions correctly. Let me check the recipe again.

The recipe says: dice the pork chop, roast it, slice the purple potato, fry it, slice the red potato, fry it, then prepare the meal. So the user has to slice both potatoes and fry them. But in the current state, the user has the pork chop and purple potato on the stove. The red potato is still not taken. So the next step is to take the red potato, slice it, then fry it. But the user might not have the knife. Wait, the knife is on the table. So take the knife first, then slice the red potato. Then put it on the stove. Then maybe the meal is ready. But the user needs to follow each step correctly. So the next action should be taking the red potato.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook the pork chop with the potatoes. They've followed the recipe steps: took the ingredients, sliced the red potato, put all on the stove. Now, the problem is using the verb "cook" with multiple objects. The game says "You can't use multiple objects with that verb." So maybe the correct action is to use the stove as the heat source instead of "cook." Earlier, the user tried "use stove as heat source" but it wasn't recognized. Maybe the correct command is "heat" instead of "cook." Alternatively, since the stove is already used, maybe the meal is prepared now. But the user needs to finish the steps. The next step would be to use the stove to heat the ingredients, so the command should be "heat pork chop with purple potato and red potato." But the game might require a different phrasing. Alternatively, since the stove is the source, maybe "put all on stove" and then "heat." But the user already put them on the stove. Maybe the final step is to "prepare meal" as per the recipe. So the next action is to prepare the meal.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to cook a meal using the ingredients from the cookbook. They've followed the recipe steps: took the pork chop, purple potato, red potato, sliced the red potato, and put all on the stove. The problem is the final step where they need to cook the ingredients. The game keeps rejecting the command "use stove to cook..." because it's not a recognized verb.

So, the user needs to find the correct verb for the final action. Since the stove is the heat source, maybe the correct action is to "heat" the ingredients on the stove. Alternatively, since the recipe says "roast the pork chop" and "fry the potatoes," maybe the user needs to use specific verbs for each step. But the user has already put everything on the stove, so the final step might be to "prepare the meal" or "serve the meal." However, the game might expect a different command. Since "cook" isn't working, maybe "heat" is the right verb here. So the next action should be "heat pork chop with purple potato and red potato" using the stove.

Okay, the user is stuck again. They've followed all the recipe steps: took the ingredients, sliced the red potato, put everything on the stove. The final step is to cook them, but the game isn't accepting the commands. The previous attempts used "heat" and "cook" with the stove, but it's not working.

Maybe the correct verb is "roast" for the pork chop and "fry" for the potatoes. The recipe says "roast the pork chop" and "fry the potatoes". So instead of using "heat", the user should use the specific verbs from the recipe. Let's try "roast pork chop" and "fry purple potato and red potato". But the user has already put them on the stove. Maybe the action is to "roast" the pork chop and "fry" the potatoes using the stove. The game might expect "roast" and "fry" as separate commands. So the next step is to roast the pork chop and fry the potatoes.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, the user is trying to cook the meal but keeps getting errors with the verbs. They've followed the recipe steps: took the ingredients, sliced the red potato, put everything on the stove. The final step is to cook them, but the game isn't accepting the commands. The previous attempts used "heat", "roast", "fry", but all are rejected.

Maybe the correct verb is "cook" but with the stove as the object. The recipe says "roast the pork chop" and "fry the potatoes". So perhaps the user needs to use "roast" and "fry" separately. But the game might require a different phrasing. Alternatively, since the stove is the heat source, the correct action is to "use stove to cook". But the user tried that before. Maybe the game expects "cook" without specifying the stove. Alternatively, the user might need to "prepare the meal" as the final step. Since all other verbs are rejected, maybe "prepare" is the right command here.
