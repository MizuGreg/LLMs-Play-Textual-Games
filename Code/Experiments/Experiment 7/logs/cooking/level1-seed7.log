You arrive in a kitchen. A typical one. You start to take note of what's in the room.

Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a fridge. The fridge contains a block of cheese and an orange bell pepper. You scan the room, seeing an oven. You wonder idly who left that here. You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a knife. You make out a counter. You see a red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow apple, a raw yellow potato, a tomato and a cookbook on the counter. You see a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is in a kitchen game where they need to cook a meal using the ingredients from the cookbook. The goal is to follow the recipe steps correctly.

First, the user picked up the cookbook and the red apple. The recipe says to dice the red apple, roast it, and prepare the meal. But the user is having trouble finding the oven or stove to cook it. They tried going to various places like the oven, stove, table, fridge, counter, but each time it says "You can't see any such thing." That's confusing because the kitchen should have those items.

Wait, maybe the user is stuck in a loop because they keep trying to go to the same places. The initial description mentioned an oven, a stove, a table, and a counter. But when they try to go to those locations, it doesn't work. Maybe the correct approach is to use the items already in the room instead of moving to locations. For example, the knife is on the table, so maybe they need to use the knife to dice the apple first. Then, use the stove or oven to roast it. But the user hasn't used the knife yet. So the next step might be to use the knife on the apple to dice it, then proceed to roast it using the stove or oven. But the user needs to find the right tool and location. Since the stove is mentioned, maybe they should try using the stove instead of going to it. Alternatively, maybe the oven is the right place, but the user needs to check the available tools. The key is to not keep trying to move to the same places but instead use the existing items in the room.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is trying to cook a meal using the recipe from the cookbook. The recipe requires dicing the red apple, roasting it, and preparing the meal. So far, they've picked up the cookbook and the red apple. The next step is to dice the apple, but they're having trouble using the knife.

The user tried several commands like "use knife on red apple" and "dice red apple," but the system isn't recognizing them. The problem might be that the correct verb is "slice" instead of "dice," or maybe "cut." Since the knife is on the table, they need to use it on the apple. The previous attempts to use "dice" aren't working, so maybe the correct action is to "cut" the apple with the knife. Alternatively, the system might expect a different phrasing. The key is to find the right verb that the system accepts. Since "dice" isn't working, trying "cut" might be the solution. So the next action should be to cut the apple with the knife.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe. The recipe says to dice the red apple, roast it, and prepare the meal. So far, they've picked up the cookbook and the red apple. The next step is to dice the apple, but they're having trouble with the commands.

They tried "use knife on red apple" and "dice red apple," but the system isn't recognizing those. The user is stuck in a loop where they keep trying the same actions. The problem might be that the correct verb is "slice" instead of "dice," or maybe the system expects a different phrasing. Since "dice" isn't working, maybe "cut" is the right verb. But the system is still not accepting it. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the knife on the apple first. The previous attempts to use the knife didn't work because the command structure was wrong. The correct action might be "cut the red apple with the knife." But the system is still not recognizing it. 

Wait, the user has the knife on the table. So maybe the correct command is "take knife" first, then "cut apple." But the user hasn't taken the knife yet. So the next step is to take the knife, then use it to cut the apple. But the user is trying to cut it without taking the knife. That's probably why it's not working. So the correct sequence is: take the knife, then cut the apple with it. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action should be to take the knife first.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe. The recipe requires dicing the red apple, roasting it, and preparing the meal. So far, they've picked up the cookbook and the red apple. They took the knife from the table but are still having trouble cutting the apple.

The user has tried multiple commands like "cut red apple with knife" but the system isn't recognizing them. The problem might be that the correct verb is "slice" instead of "cut," or maybe the system expects a different phrasing. Since "cut" isn't working, maybe "slice" is the right word. Alternatively, the user might need to use the knife on the apple directly without the verb. The key is to find the right command that the system accepts. Since the user has the knife and the apple, the next step is to slice the apple with the knife. But the system is still not recognizing it. Maybe the correct command is "slice the red apple with the knife." But the user has to use the correct syntax. So the next action should be to slice the apple with the knife.
