You've just walked into a kitchen.

You see a fridge. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? The fridge contains a carrot. You make out an oven, so there's that. You can make out a table. You see a cookbook on the table. You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is an open plain door leading south. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe in the cookbook. The recipe says to dice the yellow potato, then fry it, then prepare the meal. So far, they've taken the yellow potato from the counter. Now they need to dice it.

But the system is asking, "What do you want to dice the yellow potato with?" So they need to use a tool to dice the potato. The available tools in the kitchen are a knife. The user has a knife on the counter. So the next step is to use the knife to dice the potato.

Wait, the user hasn't used the knife yet. The counter has a knife. So the correct action would be to take the knife first, then use it to dice the potato. But the user is at the step where they need to dice the potato. The system is prompting for the tool. So the user needs to specify the knife. But in the previous steps, the user took the yellow potato. Now, they need to use the knife to dice it. So the next action should be to use the knife on the potato. But the system might require the user to take the knife first. Let me check the available items again.

The counter has a raw yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, and a knife. So the knife is on the counter. The user hasn't taken the knife yet. So the user needs to take the knife first, then dice the potato with it. But the current prompt is asking what to use to dice the potato. So the user should respond with "use knife" or "dice with knife". But the system might require the user to take the knife first. However, in the previous step, the user took the potato. Now, they need to use the knife. So the next action is to take the knife, then dice the potato. But the system is asking for the tool. So the correct action is to use the knife. But the user hasn't taken the knife yet. So maybe the user needs to take the knife first. But the system's prompt is asking for the tool. So the user should answer with "knife" to dice the potato. But the system might not accept that. Alternatively, the user might need to take the knife first. Let me think again.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is trying to follow a recipe to cook a meal. The recipe requires dicing the yellow potato, frying it, and then preparing the meal. So far, they've taken the yellow potato, used the knife to dice it, which worked. Now they need to fry the potato.

The user tried "fry yellow potato" and "fry the yellow potato", but the system didn't recognize those as valid verbs. The previous action was dicing the potato, which was successful. The next step is frying. Since "fry" isn't working, maybe the correct verb is "cook" or "sear". But the recipe says "fry", so perhaps the system expects a different phrasing. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the stove. The stove is in the kitchen, but earlier it was described as empty. Wait, the user has a knife and a potato. The stove might need to be used to fry. So maybe the correct action is to use the stove to fry the potato. But the system might require the exact verb. Since "fry" isn't working, maybe "cook" is the synonym. Alternatively, the user might need to put the potato on the stove. But the stove is empty. Hmm. The previous step was dicing, so the next step is frying. The correct action should be "fry the yellow potato" but the system doesn't recognize it. So maybe the user needs to use the stove. The command could be "put yellow potato on stove" or "fry on stove". But the recipe says "fry the yellow potato". Since the system didn't accept "fry", maybe the correct action is "cook" instead. But the recipe specifies "fry". Alternatively, the user might need to use the stove. So the next action is to use the stove to fry the potato. But the system might require the exact command. Since "fry" isn't working, maybe "cook" is the correct verb. So the next action is "cook the yellow potato".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to win the game by following the recipe. The goal is to cook a meal using the ingredients and steps from the cookbook. So far, they've taken the yellow potato, diced it with the knife, fried it on the stove, and prepared the meal. The score increased each time, and now they've reached the final step.

But the system is prompting "That's not a verb I recognise" when they try to "prepare meal". Wait, in the previous steps, after frying the potato, the user tried "prepare meal" and the system said "Adding the meal to your inventory." Then the score increased again. But then the user tried "You win!" which the system didn't recognize as a verb. So the actual win condition might be when the meal is prepared, which was done by adding it to the inventory. However, the game might require a specific command to confirm the meal is ready. Since the user already followed the recipe steps, maybe the correct action is to "eat the meal" or "consume the meal". But the game might have a different verb. Alternatively, since the score increased after preparing the meal, the game might consider that as winning. But the user is getting errors when trying to say "You win!" so perhaps the correct action is to "eat the meal" or "serve the meal". But the system might not recognize those. Alternatively, the game might have a hidden command. Since the user has already completed all steps, the next action should be to "eat the meal" even if it's not a verb. But the system is strict. Maybe the correct command is "eat" followed by the meal. But the user can't input that. Alternatively, the game might have a win condition when the meal is prepared, so the user just needs to confirm by doing nothing, but the system is expecting a command. Since the user tried "You win!" and it's not recognized, maybe the correct command is "done" or "finish". But the system might not accept that. The user needs to find the correct verb that the system accepts. Since the previous steps worked with "prepare meal", maybe the correct action is to "serve the meal" or "present the meal". But the system might not recognize those. Alternatively, the game might have a hidden command like "finish cooking" or "complete meal". But the user has to guess. Given the previous steps, the correct action is to "eat the meal" even if it's not a verb. But the system is strict. Maybe the user should just say "eat" without the meal. But the system might not accept that. Alternatively, the game might have a win condition when the meal is prepared, so the user just needs to confirm by doing nothing, but the system is expecting a command. Since the user can't input anything else, maybe the correct answer is to "eat" even if it's not a verb. But the system is not recognizing it. So the user has to find the correct command. The correct answer is "eat the meal" but the system doesn't recognize it. Therefore, the user should try "eat" as the command.
