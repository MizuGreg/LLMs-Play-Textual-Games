You have come into the most normal of all possible kitchens.

You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You make out a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a green apple, a green bell pepper and a yellow apple. You make out a stove. But the thing is empty.

There is an open plain door leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe in the cookbook. The recipe says to chop the green apple, roast it, and prepare the meal. So the goal is to follow those steps.

First, they found the cookbook in the kitchen, which was the first step. Then they took the knife from the table. The next step was to chop the green apple. But when they tried "chop the green apple," the game said it requires a knife. They already have the knife, so maybe they need to use it on the apple. But the previous attempt to "use knife on green apple" wasn't recognized. Maybe the correct command is "chop the green apple" again, but the game is expecting a different phrasing. Alternatively, maybe "cut the green apple" instead of "chop." But the game didn't accept "use knife on green apple," so perhaps the correct action is to "chop the green apple" again, even though it's the same as before. Wait, but the user tried that and got the same error. So maybe the game is expecting a different verb, like "cut" instead of "chop." Or maybe the knife is already in hand, so the command should be "cut the green apple" with the knife. But the user has the knife, so maybe the correct action is to "cut the green apple" instead of "chop." Alternatively, maybe the game is expecting "chop" but the apple is not in the right place. Wait, the user has the green apple in hand, so maybe they need to chop it. But the game says "Cutting something requires a knife," which they have. So perhaps the correct command is "chop the green apple" again, even though it's the same as before. But the user tried that and got the same error. Hmm, maybe the game is expecting "cut" instead of "chop." Let me check the previous steps. The recipe says "chop the green apple," but maybe the game uses "cut" as the verb. So the user should try "cut the green apple" instead of "chop." That might be the issue. So the next step is to use "cut" instead of "chop."

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to cook a meal according to the recipe in the cookbook. The recipe requires chopping the green apple, roasting it, and preparing the meal.

So far, the user has taken the knife from the table, picked up the green apple, and successfully chopped it. The next step according to the recipe is to roast the green apple. The user hasn't done that yet. The current action was chopping, so now they need to move on to roasting. The game might expect the command "roast the green apple" instead of "chop" for the next step. Since the user already chopped the apple, the next logical step is to roast it. The user should try "roast the green apple" to proceed. There's no indication of a loop here because each action moves them closer to the goal. So the next action should be roasting.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the recipe to cook a meal. The recipe says to chop the green apple, roast it, and prepare the meal. So far, they've chopped the apple. Now they need to roast it.

The problem is that the game isn't recognizing "roast" as a verb. Maybe the correct command is "put in oven" or "place in oven". Since the user has the green apple, they need to get it into the oven. The previous attempts to use "roast" didn't work, so maybe the correct action is to put the apple in the oven instead of roasting it directly. That makes sense because the oven is mentioned in the kitchen description. So the next step should be to put the apple in the oven. Let me check the previous steps again. The user has the knife and the apple. They chopped the apple, so now they need to put it in the oven. The correct command would be "put the green apple in the oven" or something similar. But the game might expect a shorter command like "put green apple in oven". Let me try that.

FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to cook a meal according to the recipe. The recipe requires chopping the green apple, roasting it, and preparing the meal. So far, the user has chopped the apple and put it in the oven. Now, the next step is to roast it. But the game isn't recognizing "roast" as a verb. Maybe the correct action is to "leave the green apple in the oven" or "wait for the oven to roast it". But the recipe says to roast it, so perhaps the user needs to use a different command. Since the oven is open and the apple is inside, maybe the next step is to "prepare the meal" once the apple is roasted. But the user hasn't prepared the meal yet. Alternatively, maybe the game expects the user to "cook the green apple" instead of "roast". But the previous attempts to use "roast" didn't work. The user might need to use a synonym like "bake" or "heat". However, the correct action here is likely "prepare the meal" after the apple is roasted. But since the user can't roast it directly, maybe they need to wait for the oven to do it. But the game might require an explicit command. The user has already put the apple in the oven, so the next step is to prepare the meal. But the recipe says to roast first. Hmm, maybe the user should try "cook the green apple" instead of "roast". Let me check the previous steps again. The user put the apple in the oven, so maybe the next step is to "prepare the meal" once it's roasted. But the game might not recognize that. Alternatively, the user might need to "take the green apple from the oven" and then "roast" it. But the game says "roast the green apple" isn't a verb. Maybe the correct command is "heat the green apple in the oven". But the user has to follow the recipe's directions. The recipe says "roast the green apple", so the user should try that again. But the game isn't recognizing it. Maybe the user needs to use "cook" instead of "roast". Let me try that.

Okay, let's see. The user's goal is to cook a meal according to the recipe. The recipe has three steps: chop the green apple, roast it, and prepare the meal. So far, the user has chopped the apple and roasted it. Now, the next step is to prepare the meal. The game might expect the command "prepare meal" or "make meal". Since the user has already done the first two steps, the final step is to prepare the meal. The previous action was roasting, so now they need to prepare the meal. The correct command should be "prepare meal" or something similar. Let me check the previous steps again. The user roasted the apple, so now they need to prepare the meal. The game might accept "prepare meal" as the next step.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the recipe to cook a meal. The recipe says to chop the green apple, roast it, and prepare the meal. So far, they've chopped and roasted the apple. Now, the next step is to prepare the meal. But the game isn't recognizing commands like "prepare meal" or "make meal". The user has tried several variations but keep getting errors. Maybe the correct command is "eat the meal" since that's the final step after preparing it. Alternatively, maybe "serve the meal" or "finish the meal". Since the game is having trouble with "prepare", perhaps the user needs to use a different verb that's more likely to be recognized, like "cook" or "prepare". But the previous attempts with "cook" didn't work. Wait, the user already roasted the apple, so maybe the meal is already prepared, and the final step is to eat it. But the game might require the user to confirm that the meal is ready. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "take the meal" from the oven. But the user has the apple in hand. Hmm, maybe the correct action is "eat the meal" even though it's not a verb in the recipe. The game might be expecting that as the final step. Let me try that.
