THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to solve this game. The user's goal is to cook a delicious meal by checking the cookbook in the kitchen. So first, I need to find the kitchen.

Looking at the movement so far, the player has been moving between the Bedroom, Livingroom, Corridor, and back. The exits are always north, south, east, west, but no doors. The problem is that the player is stuck in a loop between the Livingroom and Bedroom, and the Corridor. They haven't found the kitchen yet.

The cookbook is in the kitchen, so the next step is to find the kitchen. The current location is the Corridor (after going east from the Livingroom). The Corridor has exits to the south (back to Livingroom) and west (maybe towards the kitchen? Or another area). But the player has been going back and forth between these rooms without progress.

Wait, maybe the kitchen is in a different direction. Let me check the previous steps again. The player started in the Bedroom, went north to Livingroom, then south back to Bedroom, then east to Corridor, west back to Livingroom, south to Bedroom again. So the loop is between Bedroom, Livingroom, Corridor. Maybe the kitchen is in the west direction from the Corridor? But the Corridor's exits are south and west. If the player goes west from the Corridor, maybe that leads to the kitchen. But earlier, when they went west from the Corridor (step 9), they ended up in the Corridor again? Wait, no. Let me check the history again.

Wait, in step 9, the user is in the Corridor. The previous action was "go east" from the Livingroom (step 8), which led to the Corridor. Then, the user went west from the Corridor (step 9), which brings them back to the Livingroom. But the Livingroom's exits are east, south, west. So maybe the kitchen is in another direction. Alternatively, maybe the player needs to go west from the Corridor again, but that led back to the Livingroom. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the kitchen is in the west direction from the Corridor. But the Corridor's description says there's an exit to the south and west. So if the player goes west from the Corridor, they might reach the kitchen. But in the previous steps, when the player was in the Corridor (step 9), they went west and ended up in the Livingroom again. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe the Corridor's west exit leads to the kitchen. But the user hasn't tried that yet. Wait, in step 9, the user was in the Corridor and went west, which led back to the Livingroom. That suggests that the west exit from the Corridor is back to the Livingroom. So maybe the kitchen is in another direction. Alternatively, maybe the player needs to go south from the Corridor to the Livingroom, then east to the Corridor again, but that's just looping.

Wait, the initial problem is that the player hasn't found the kitchen yet. The cookbook is in the kitchen. So the player needs to find the kitchen. The current location is the Corridor. The exits are south (Livingroom) and west (maybe another area). But the player hasn't explored west from the Corridor yet. Wait, in step 9, when the user was in the Corridor, they went west and ended up in the Livingroom. So maybe the west exit from the Corridor is back to the Livingroom. Therefore, the kitchen must be in another direction. Maybe the player needs to go south from the Corridor to the Livingroom, then east to the Corridor again, but that's not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe the player needs to go west from the Corridor again, but that leads back to the Livingroom. So perhaps the player needs to find another way. Wait, maybe the kitchen is in the west direction from the Livingroom. But the Livingroom's exits are east, south, west. If the player goes west from the Livingroom, maybe that leads to the kitchen. But in the previous steps, when the player was in the Livingroom (step 6), they tried going south, east, west. But the player hasn't tried going west from the Livingroom yet. Wait, in step 6, the user was in the Livingroom and tried going south, which led back to the Bedroom. Then in step 7, they went north back to the Livingroom. Then step 8, they went east to the Corridor. Then step 9, west back to Livingroom. So maybe the player needs to go west from the Livingroom now. Let me check the Livingroom's description again.

In the Livingroom, the exits are east, south, west. So if the player goes west from the Livingroom, maybe that's the kitchen. But the player hasn't tried that yet. So the next step would be to go west from the Livingroom. But in the previous steps, the player was in the Corridor (step 9), then went west to Livingroom again. So the player is now in the Livingroom again. The next action should be to go west from the Livingroom to reach the kitchen. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the correct next action is to go west from the Livingroom. But the user's last action was going west from the Corridor, which brought them back to the Livingroom. So now, in the Livingroom, they need to go west to reach the kitchen. Therefore, the next command should be "go west".

<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to cook a meal using the cookbook in the kitchen. They've already found the kitchen, took the cookbook, and started reading the recipe. The recipe requires gathering ingredients: red bell pepper, red potato, yellow bell pepper. The user tried to take the red bell pepper from the table but couldn't see it.

Looking around, the kitchen has a table with a cookbook, a fridge (which was an oven), a counter with a raw red potato, a red apple, a raw purple potato, and a knife. The stove is there but empty. The user needs to gather the ingredients mentioned in the recipe. The recipe says "red bell pepper," but the counter has a red potato and a purple potato. Maybe the user is confused between potato and pepper. The recipe might have a typo, but the user needs to follow it.

The user tried "take red bell pepper from table" but it's not there. The table has the cookbook, not the peppers. The counter has the potatoes. Maybe the user needs to take the red potato (since that's the only potato available) and maybe the apple, but the recipe specifies peppers. Wait, the recipe says red bell pepper, yellow bell pepper, and red potato. But the counter has a red potato and a purple potato. Maybe the user needs to take the red potato and find the peppers elsewhere. But the user can't see the peppers. Maybe the peppers are in the fridge? The fridge was mentioned as an oven, but maybe it's a mistake. Alternatively, the user might need to use the knife to cut the potatoes, but the recipe says to slice the red bell pepper and red potato. Since the user can't find the peppers, maybe they have to proceed with the available items. The user is stuck because they can't find the peppers. The next step is to check the fridge (even though it's labeled as an oven) for the peppers. Alternatively, maybe the user should take the red potato and proceed, assuming the peppers are available. But the user needs to follow the recipe exactly. Since the user can't find the peppers, they might need to look elsewhere. The correct action would be to check the fridge for the peppers, even if it's labeled as an oven.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal using the recipe from the cookbook. They've gathered the red potato, but still need the red bell pepper and yellow bell pepper. The problem is that the game doesn't show the peppers anywhere, even though the recipe says they're needed.

First, the goal is to follow the recipe's ingredients. The user has the red potato, but the other two ingredients are missing. The kitchen has a counter with a red potato and a purple potato, and a fridge (which is actually an oven). The user tried taking the peppers from various places but couldn't find them.

Maybe the peppers are not physically present, so the user has to proceed with the available items. The recipe might have a typo, but the user needs to follow it. Since the peppers aren't there, perhaps the next step is to use the red potato and the apple (even though the recipe doesn't mention it) to make a meal. Alternatively, the user might need to use the knife to prepare the potato. But the game is stuck because the peppers aren't visible. The correct action would be to proceed with the available ingredients, even if it's not perfect. So the next step is to fry the red potato and the apple, even though the recipe says to use peppers. But the user needs to follow the recipe exactly. Wait, the user has the red potato, so maybe they can use that instead of the pepper. But the recipe specifies peppers. This is confusing. The user is in a loop because they can't find the peppers. The answer is to take the red potato and proceed, even if it's not the recipe's intention. So the next action is to fry the red potato.

Alternatively, the user might need to use the knife to prepare the potato. But the game doesn't recognize those actions.

FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is trying to cook a meal using the recipe from the cookbook. They've found the kitchen, taken the cookbook, and started reading the recipe. The recipe requires red bell pepper, red potato, and yellow bell pepper. The user has the red potato but can't find the peppers.

The user has tried taking the red bell pepper from various places but couldn't find it. The kitchen has a counter with a red potato and a purple potato, and a fridge (which is actually an oven). The user is stuck because the peppers aren't visible. The next step is to proceed with the available ingredients, even if it's not the recipe's intention. So, the user should cook the meal with the red potato and maybe the apple, even though the recipe doesn't mention it. The correct action is to cook the meal with the available ingredients.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal using the recipe from the cookbook. They've gathered the red potato but are missing the red bell pepper and yellow bell pepper. The kitchen has a stove, but the ingredients aren't visible. The user tried various actions like taking the potato, but couldn't proceed with the recipe.

First, the goal is to follow the recipe's steps: gather ingredients and follow directions. The user has the red potato, but needs the peppers. Since the game doesn't show the peppers, maybe they're not present, so the user has to proceed with what's available. The next step is to use the red potato and the apple (even though the recipe doesn't mention it) to make a meal. Alternatively, the user might need to use the knife to prepare the potato. But the game doesn't recognize those actions. The correct action is to cook the meal with the available ingredients, even if it's not perfect.
