THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they're moving between rooms: Livingroom and Bedroom. The goal is to cook a meal by finding a recipe in the kitchen. But so far, the user has been moving back and forth between the two rooms, going north and south repeatedly. The problem is that they're stuck in a loop without making progress toward the kitchen.

First, I need to recall the original goal: find the cookbook in the kitchen, then cook the meal. The user hasn't found the kitchen yet. The current location is the Livingroom, and the Bedroom is just a loop between the two.

Looking at the previous actions, the user has been going north (to Bedroom) and south (back to Livingroom) repeatedly. This is a loop, so the next step is to break it. The user needs to find a way out of this cycle. Maybe there's another direction not yet explored? But according to the descriptions, the exits are only north and south between these rooms. Wait, maybe the kitchen is accessible from one of these rooms but wasn't mentioned yet. Or perhaps the user needs to look for objects like a cookbook in the current room.

Wait, in the Livingroom description, the user is told to check the cookbook in the kitchen. But the user is in the Livingroom. So maybe the next step is to look for the cookbook in the Livingroom, but the description says the sofa is empty. Alternatively, maybe the exit to the kitchen is through another direction, but the user hasn't checked other directions yet. However, the previous responses only allowed north and south. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to look for the cookbook in the current room, but the Livingroom doesn't have it. So the user needs to find the correct exit to the kitchen. But the current exits are only north and south, which loop between the two rooms. So perhaps the user is stuck unless they find another way. But the game might require looking for the cookbook in the kitchen, which is not yet accessible.

Wait, the initial instruction says to check the cookbook in the kitchen. So the user needs to get to the kitchen. But the current rooms are Livingroom and Bedroom, which are looping. So maybe the user needs to find another exit. But according to the previous steps, the exits are only north and south. Unless there's a hidden exit or a different action needed.

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to look for the cookbook in the Livingroom, but the description says the sofa is empty. So perhaps the user needs to try a different action, like looking around more, but the game's responses only allow movement. Since the user is stuck in a loop, the next step is to try a different action, like checking the sofa for the cookbook, even though it's empty. But the game might require that the user finds the cookbook in the kitchen, so maybe the user needs to find the correct exit to the kitchen.

Wait, the initial problem is that the user is stuck moving between the two rooms. The only way out is to find the kitchen. But the current exits don't lead to the kitchen. So perhaps the user needs to look for another way, like using a different verb, such as "look" to check the room for the cookbook. But the game's previous responses only allowed movement. However, the user's goal is to find the cookbook, so maybe the next step is to look in the current room for the cookbook, even though the description says the sofa is empty. Alternatively, the user might need to find the kitchen through another path.

But according to the game's structure, the user is stuck in a loop between the two rooms. The only way to break the loop is to find a different action. Since the previous actions were going north and south, which loop, the user needs to try a different command, like "look" to check the room for the cookbook. However, the game's previous responses didn't allow that. But the user's goal is to find the cookbook, so maybe the next step is to look around in the current room.

But the user's previous actions were only moving. So the next step is to break the loop by trying a different action, like looking for the cookbook in the Livingroom. However, the game's description says the sofa is empty. So maybe the user needs to find the kitchen through another exit, but the game's current setup doesn't show that. Therefore, the user is stuck, and the correct action is to try a different command, like "look" to check the room for the cookbook, even though it's not there. But the game might require that the user finds the cookbook in the kitchen, so the user needs to find the correct exit.

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go east or west, but the game's descriptions don't mention those directions. Therefore, the user is stuck in a loop, and the next step is to try a different action, like "look" to check the room for the cookbook. But the game's previous responses didn't allow that. However, the user's goal is to find the cookbook, so the next step is to look for it in the current room, even though it's not there. But the game might require that the user finds the kitchen, so maybe the user needs to find the correct exit.

But according to the game's structure, the user is stuck in a loop between the two rooms. Therefore, the next step is to try a different action, like "look" to check the room for the cookbook, which might be the solution.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is stuck in a loop between the Livingroom and Bedroom, moving north and south repeatedly. The goal is to find the cookbook in the kitchen to cook a meal.

First, the goal is to find the cookbook in the kitchen and then cook. So far, the user hasn't found the kitchen yet. They've only been moving between two rooms.

Second, the past actions involve moving back and forth between the two rooms. The user has checked the sofa in the Livingroom but found nothing. The Bedroom has a bed but no items. No progress toward the kitchen.

Third, the user is in a loop. The same actions (go north/south) aren't leading to the kitchen. Need to break the loop. Maybe the kitchen is accessible from another direction not yet explored, or perhaps the user needs to look for the cookbook in the current room again. But the game's responses so far don't show any other exits. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use a different command like "look" or "check" to find the cookbook.

Since the previous actions of moving didn't help, the next step is to try a different action, like looking around more carefully. But the game might require moving to the kitchen. Wait, maybe the exit to the north from the Bedroom leads to the kitchen. But the user hasn't tried that yet. Wait, in the Bedroom description, it says there's an exit to the north. So going north from the Bedroom might lead to the kitchen. But the user has been going south from the Bedroom, which loops back. So the next step is to go north from the Bedroom instead of south. That would break the loop and lead to the kitchen.

You can make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a counter? On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato. Huh, weird. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove appears to be empty. This always happens, here in TextWorld!

There is a closed frosted-glass door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal using the recipe from the cookbook. The goal is to gather the ingredients and follow the directions. So far, they've taken the cookbook but couldn't take the pork chop, red onion, or white tuna. The problem is that the ingredients aren't in the kitchen, so the user needs to find them.

First step: The goal is to cook a meal by gathering the ingredients from the recipe and following the directions. The user has the cookbook but needs the ingredients.

Second step: The user has looked at the cookbook and tried to take the ingredients, but they aren't there. The next step should be to find where the ingredients are. The kitchen has a fridge, maybe the ingredients are there.

Third step: The user is stuck because they can't take the ingredients. They need to check the fridge. The previous actions were taking the ingredients, but since they aren't present, the correct action is to check the fridge for the ingredients. So the next command should be to open the fridge.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal using the recipe from the cookbook. They've gathered all the ingredients: red onion, pork chop, white tuna, red bell pepper, yellow onion, white onion, and red tuna. The next step is to follow the recipe's directions.

The user tried "cook meal" and "use cookbook", but those weren't recognized. Then they tried "follow directions", which also didn't work. The game probably expects a specific command to execute the recipe. Since the recipe is in the cookbook, maybe the correct action is to "read cookbook" or "check cookbook" to follow the steps. Alternatively, the game might require using the ingredients in the order given by the recipe. But since the user has all the ingredients, the next step is to follow the directions step by step. The correct command might be "cook" or "prepare meal", but the game doesn't recognize those. Maybe the user needs to use the exact words from the recipe, like "dice the pork chop" or "fry the pork chop". But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action should be to follow the directions as listed in the cookbook.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is trying to follow a recipe to cook a meal. They've gathered all the ingredients but are stuck on the first step: dicing the pork chop. The game keeps asking for a tool, like a knife, which the user has in the kitchen.

First, the goal is to cook the meal by following the recipe's directions. The user has the ingredients and the cookbook. The next step is to execute the recipe's steps, starting with dicing the pork chop.

Second, the user has taken the ingredients and is now at the step where they need to dice the pork chop. The game requires using the knife from the table. Previous attempts to use "use knife" didn't work, so maybe the correct command is to use the knife on the pork chop.

Third, the user is in a loop of trying to dice the pork chop without specifying the tool. The correct action is to use the knife from the table to dice the pork chop. The previous command "dice pork chop" didn't specify the tool, so the next step is to use the knife.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a recipe to cook a meal. They've gathered all the ingredients but are stuck on the first step: dicing the pork chop. The game keeps asking for a tool, like a knife, which the user has in the kitchen.

First, the goal is to cook the meal by following the recipe's directions. The user has the ingredients and the cookbook. The next step is to execute the recipe's steps, starting with dicing the pork chop.

Second, the user has taken the ingredients and is now at the step where they need to dice the pork chop. The game requires using the knife from the table. Previous attempts to use "use knife" didn't work, so maybe the correct command is to use the knife on the pork chop.

Third, the user is in a loop of trying to dice the pork chop without specifying the tool. The correct action is to use the knife from the table to dice the pork chop. The previous command "dice pork chop" didn't specify the tool, so the next step is to use the knife.
