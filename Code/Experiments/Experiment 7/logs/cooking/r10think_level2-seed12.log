You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. A typical kind of place. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."

What's that over there? It looks like it's a fridge. The fridge contains a raw red tuna, a red onion and a raw white tuna. You see an oven. You scan the room, seeing a table. On the table you make out a cookbook. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a tomato, a red hot pepper and a knife. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You smell a sickening smell, and follow it to a stove. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to proceed. The user is in a kitchen game where they need to cook a meal based on the recipe from the cookbook. The goal is to follow the recipe steps correctly.

First, the recipe says to slice the red tuna and roast it. The user has already taken the red tuna from the fridge. Now, they need to slice it. But earlier attempts to slice it resulted in errors because the knife wasn't used properly. The user tried "slice the red tuna" but got a message saying a knife is needed. Then they tried using the knife, but the system didn't recognize the command.

So, the next step is to use the knife on the red tuna. The correct command might be "slice the red tuna with the knife" or "cut the red tuna with the knife". But the system didn't accept "slice" alone, so maybe using "cut" instead of "slice" would work. Alternatively, using the knife to slice.

Wait, the user tried "use the knife on the red tuna" which didn't work. Maybe the correct verb is "slice" with the knife. But the system said "That's not a verb I recognise." So perhaps the correct command is "cut the red tuna with the knife". Let me check the previous steps again.

The user took the red tuna. Now, they need to slice it. The knife is on the counter. So the correct action is to use the knife to slice the red tuna. The previous attempt was "use the knife on the red tuna", which didn't work. Maybe the correct command is "slice the red tuna with the knife". But the system said that's not a verb. Alternatively, "cut the red tuna with the knife".

Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "cut the red tuna" after taking the knife. Wait, the user hasn't taken the knife yet. The knife is on the counter. So first, take the knife, then use it to slice the tuna.

Wait, the user hasn't taken the knife yet. The counter has a knife. So the steps would be: take the knife, then use it to slice the red tuna. But the user is currently holding the red tuna. So maybe the correct sequence is take the knife, then slice the tuna with the knife.

But the user's last action was taking the red tuna. Now, they need to take the knife first. Then, use it to slice the tuna. Let me check the previous messages. The counter has a knife. So the next step is to take the knife, then slice the tuna with it.

But the user tried "use the knife on the red tuna" and it didn't work. Maybe the correct command is "slice the red tuna with the knife". But the system said that's not a verb. Alternatively, "cut the red tuna with the knife".

Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "cut the red tuna" after taking the knife. But the user hasn't taken the knife yet. So the next step is to take the knife, then cut the tuna.

So the next action should be "take the knife", then "cut the red tuna with the knife".

Okay, let's break this down. The user is trying to follow a recipe to cook a meal. The recipe requires slicing and roasting the red tuna and tomato. So far, they've taken the red tuna from the fridge and the knife from the counter. The next step is to slice the red tuna using the knife.

But the user keeps getting errors when trying to use the knife. The system isn't recognizing commands like "cut the red tuna with the knife." Maybe the correct verb is "slice" instead of "cut," but the system didn't accept "slice" earlier. Alternatively, maybe the action needs to be phrased differently, like "use the knife to slice the red tuna."

Wait, the user tried "use the knife on the red tuna" before, which didn't work. The system might expect the command to be "slice the red tuna with the knife" or "cut the red tuna with the knife." But the user is getting feedback that it only understands up to "cut the red tuna." Maybe the system is expecting a different structure, like "slice the red tuna using the knife."

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to first take the tomato from the counter, as the recipe also requires a tomato. But the recipe's ingredients are red tuna and tomato. The user has the red tuna, but the tomato is on the counter. So maybe the next step is to take the tomato, then slice it, then roast both tuna and tomato.

But the user is stuck on slicing the tuna. The previous attempts to use the knife are not working. Maybe the correct command is "slice the red tuna" without mentioning the knife, but the system requires the knife to be used. Since the user has the knife, perhaps the correct command is "slice the red tuna with the knife."

But the system keeps saying it only understands up to "cut the red tuna." Maybe the user needs to use a different verb or structure. Alternatively, the system might be expecting "cut" instead of "slice." Let me check the recipe again. The recipe says "slice the red tuna" and "roast the red tuna." So the correct action is to slice it, but the system isn't recognizing "slice" when combined with the knife.

Perhaps the user should try "cut the red tuna with the knife" instead. But the system is still not accepting it. Maybe the correct command is "use the knife to slice the red tuna." That might be the right way to phrase it. Let me try that.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe. The recipe requires slicing and roasting the red tuna and tomato. So far, they've taken the red tuna and the knife, sliced the tuna, and now need to roast it.

The problem is that the user is repeatedly trying to use "roast" with different phrases, but the system isn't recognizing it. The correct action might be to use the oven. Since the oven is in the kitchen, maybe the command is "put the red tuna in the oven" or "roast the red tuna in the oven." But the system says "That's not a verb I recognise." So maybe the correct verb is "put" instead of "roast." Alternatively, the user might need to use the oven's function properly. Let me check the previous steps again.

The user has the red tuna and the knife. They sliced the tuna. Now, they need to roast it. The oven is available. The correct command might be "put the red tuna in the oven" or "place the red tuna in the oven." Since "roast" isn't working, maybe "put" is the right verb here. Let's try that.

THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe. The recipe requires slicing and roasting the red tuna and tomato. So far, they've taken the red tuna, sliced it, put it in the oven, and now they're stuck because the system isn't recognizing "roast" as a verb.

The user has the red tuna in the oven. The next step should be to roast it. But since "roast" isn't working, maybe the correct action is to use the oven's function. The oven is already open, so maybe the command is "use the oven to roast the red tuna" or "roast the red tuna with the oven." But the system says "That's not a verb I recognise." So perhaps the correct verb is "put" again, but the user already put it in. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to take the tomato from the counter next, as the recipe also requires a tomato. But the user hasn't done that yet. Wait, the recipe's ingredients are red tuna and tomato. The user has the red tuna, but the tomato is on the table. So maybe the next step is to take the tomato, slice it, then roast it along with the tuna. But the user is focused on the tuna. However, the system is not recognizing the roast command. Maybe the correct action is to "roast the red tuna" without specifying the oven, but the system requires the oven. Alternatively, the user might need to use the oven's function properly. Since the oven is open, maybe the command is "roast the red tuna in the oven" but the system doesn't recognize "roast." So the user needs to find another way. Maybe the correct verb is "put" again, but that's already been done. Alternatively, the user might need to use the oven's action. Since the user is stuck, the next step is to take the tomato, slice it, and then roast both. But the user is focused on the tuna. However, the system isn't accepting the roast command. So the user needs to try a different approach. Maybe the correct command is "use the oven to roast the red tuna." But the system says "That's not a verb I recognise." So perhaps the user needs to use a synonym for roast, like "bake" or "sear," but the recipe says roast. Alternatively, the user might need to use the oven's function without the verb. Since the user is stuck, the next step is to take the tomato, slice it, and then roast it. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the correct next action is to take the tomato from the counter.

The recipe says to "prepare the meal," so maybe the final action is to "prepare the meal" or "serve the meal." But the user hasn't done that yet. However, the game might consider the meal prepared once both ingredients are roasted. Since the user can't roast, maybe the correct command is to "prepare the meal" as the final step.

However, the game might consider the meal prepared once both ingredients are roasted. Since the user can't roast, maybe the correct command is to "prepare the meal" as the final step.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is in a kitchen game where they need to cook a meal based on a recipe. The recipe requires slicing and roasting the red tuna and tomato. So far, they've taken the red tuna, sliced it, put it in the oven, taken the tomato, sliced it, and put it in the oven. Now, they need to roast both items.

The problem is that the system isn't recognizing "roast" as a verb. The user has tried "roast the tomato in the oven" multiple times, but it's not working. Maybe the correct verb is "put" again, but that's already been done. Alternatively, the user might need to use the oven's function properly. Since the oven is open, maybe the command is "use the oven to roast the tomato." But the system says that's not a verb. 

Wait, the user has already put both the tuna and tomato in the oven. Maybe the next step is to let them roast, but the game requires an explicit action. Since "roast" isn't working, perhaps the correct action is to "leave the tomato in the oven" or "wait for the oven to roast it." But the game might require a specific command. Alternatively, the user might need to use the oven's action without the verb. Since the user is stuck, the next step is to check if all steps are done. The recipe says to "prepare the meal," so maybe the final action is to "prepare the meal" or "serve the meal." But the user hasn't done that yet. However, the game might consider the meal prepared once both ingredients are roasted. Since the user can't roast, maybe the correct command is to "prepare the meal" as the final step.
