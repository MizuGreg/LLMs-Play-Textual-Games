THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a game where they need to cook a meal by finding a recipe in the kitchen. The current environment is the bathroom, with an exit to the north. The user has been moving between the bathroom and corridor, but it seems like they're stuck in a loop.

First, the goal is to find the cookbook in the kitchen, check the recipe, and then cook the meal. So far, the user has been going back and forth between the bathroom and corridor, but they haven't found the kitchen yet. The corridor has a closed screen door west and an exit north, but the user kept going south, which brings them back to the bathroom. That's a loop.

The next step should be to find a way to the kitchen. Since the corridor has a closed door west, maybe they need to open it. But the user hasn't tried that yet. Alternatively, maybe the exit north from the corridor leads to the kitchen. But in the previous steps, when in the corridor, the user was told to go south, which loops back. So perhaps the correct path is to go west through the closed door, but they need to open it first. However, the user hasn't tried opening the door yet. So the next action should be to open the west door in the corridor.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is stuck in a loop between the bathroom and corridor. The goal is to find the cookbook in the kitchen, check the recipe, and cook a meal. So far, the user has been moving north and south between these two locations without making progress.

First step: The goal is to reach the kitchen, find the cookbook, check the recipe, and then cook. But the user hasn't gotten past the bathroom yet.

Second step: The past actions involve going back and forth between bathroom and corridor. The corridor has a closed door west, but the user hasn't tried opening it. The exit north from the corridor leads back to the bathroom, which is causing the loop.

Third step: The user is in a loop because they keep going north to the corridor and then south back to the bathroom. To break the loop, they need to try opening the west door in the corridor instead of just going south. The previous actions of going south don't help because they just loop back.

So the next action should be to open the west door in the corridor. That's a different action from before, which would break the loop and allow progression towards the kitchen.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to get through a loop between the bathroom and corridor. The goal is to find the cookbook in the kitchen, check the recipe, and cook. So far, they've been going back and forth without progress.

First step: The goal is to reach the kitchen, find the cookbook, check the recipe, and then cook. But they're stuck in a loop between bathroom and corridor.

Second step: Past actions include going north/south between bathroom and corridor, and trying to open the west door. The west door is closed, so they need to open it. But the system keeps saying they have to open it first.

Third step: The user is in a loop because they keep going north and south. The previous action was trying to open the west door, but it's still closed. So the next step should be to try opening the door again, maybe using a different command like 'open screen door' instead of 'open west door'. But the system might not recognize synonyms. Alternatively, maybe they need to look for a key or another item to open it. But since the user hasn't found anything else, the next action is to try opening the door again.

FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms to find the cookbook in the kitchen. So far, they've gone through the bathroom, corridor, and now the backyard. They opened the patio door and are now in the backyard.

First step: The goal is to find the cookbook in the kitchen, check the recipe, and cook. The user has reached the backyard but hasn't found the kitchen yet.

Second step: Past actions include opening the screen door, moving west to the backyard, opening the patio door. Now, the next step is to check if there's a way to the kitchen from here. The backyard has a closed wooden door leading west, which might be the kitchen door.

Third step: The user is in the backyard. The previous actions didn't lead to the kitchen directly. The closed wooden door west might be the way, so they need to open it. Alternatively, maybe the BBQ or patio table has something useful. But the main path is the wooden door. So the next action is to open the west door.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to get to the kitchen to find the cookbook. They've been moving through different areas, opening doors, but maybe they're stuck again.

First, the goal is to find the cookbook in the kitchen, check the recipe, and cook. So far, they've opened several doors and are now in the backyard. The next step is to check if the kitchen is accessible from here.

Second, past actions include opening the screen door, moving west to the backyard, opening the patio door, and then the wooden door. Now, after opening the wooden door, they might be in the kitchen or another room. The next step is to look for the cookbook.

Third, if they're in the kitchen, they need to check the cookbook. If not, maybe they need to explore further. But since the previous actions led them here, the next command should be to check the kitchen for the cookbook.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal based on the recipe from the cookbook. They followed the directions, but the game says they can't see any such thing. So, maybe they need to actually perform the cooking steps.

First, the goal is to cook the meal using the ingredients and directions from the recipe. They have the ingredients: banana, pork chop, white tuna. The directions say to slice, fry, chop, grill, slice, roast, and prepare the meal.

Second, the user has already looked at the cookbook and read the recipe. The next step is to gather the ingredients and follow the directions. But the game might require them to interact with the items in the kitchen, like using the stove or grill.

Third, the user might be stuck because they need to explicitly use the cooking appliances. Since the stove is conventional but empty, they might need to put the ingredients on it. Alternatively, maybe they need to use the oven or grill mentioned in the recipe. The previous action was trying to cook the meal, but since the stove is empty, they need to add the ingredients first.

So the next action should be to put the ingredients into the stove or use the grill. Maybe "put banana on stove" or "grill pork chop". But the game might expect a specific command. Since the directions mention frying the banana, maybe "fry banana" is the next step.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook the meal from the recipe. They have the ingredients and the directions, but they're having trouble interacting with the stove. The previous attempts to use the stove with the banana didn't work.

First, the goal is to follow the recipe steps: slice the banana, fry it, chop the pork chop, grill it, slice the white tuna, roast it, and prepare the meal. The user has already read the recipe but needs to execute the steps.

Second, the user has tried using the stove with the banana but got errors. Maybe the correct action is to put the banana on the stove instead of using it. The game might expect a specific command like "put banana on stove" or "fry banana".

Third, since the previous actions didn't work, the user needs to try a different command. The correct step might be to put the banana on the stove as per the recipe's "fry the banana" instruction. So the next action should be to put the banana on the stove.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop trying to cook the banana. They've tried "fry banana" and "put banana on stove" multiple times, but the game doesn't recognize those commands. The goal is to follow the recipe steps to prepare the meal.

First, the goal is to cook the meal by following the recipe: slice, fry, chop, grill, slice, roast, and prepare. The user has the cookbook, so they need to execute the steps.

Second, the user has already read the recipe but isn't interacting with the kitchen items correctly. The stove is conventional but empty. Maybe the correct action is to use the stove with the banana, but the game doesn't accept "fry" as a verb. Perhaps the correct command is "cook banana" or "heat banana on stove".

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

<think>
Okay, the user is stuck in a loop trying to cook the banana. They've tried multiple commands like "cook banana on stove" but it's not working. The goal is to follow the recipe steps to prepare the meal.

First, the goal is to cook the meal by following the recipe: slice, fry, chop, grill, slice, roast, and prepare. The user has the cookbook, so they need to execute the steps.

Second, the user has already read the recipe but isn't interacting with the kitchen items correctly. The stove is conventional but empty. Maybe the correct action is to use the stove with the banana, but the game doesn't accept "fry" as a verb. Perhaps the correct command is "cook" instead of "fry". So the next action should be to cook the banana on the stove.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.
