You are in a kitchen. A standard kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

You can make out a fridge. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You can see an oven. Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a raw yellow potato, a red hot pepper, a yellow apple, a banana, a red bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a yellow onion, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato and a knife. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.

There is a closed plain door leading south. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe in the cookbook. The goal is to follow the recipe steps to prepare the meal.

First, the user found the cookbook on the table and tried to open it. But the cookbook isn't something you can open, so they looked at it instead. Then they read the recipe, which requires gathering three ingredients: red hot pepper, white tuna, and yellow potato. The directions mention chopping and roasting them.

So far, the user has taken the cookbook and read the recipe. The next step would be to gather the ingredients. Let's check the kitchen items again. The ingredients listed are red hot pepper, white tuna, yellow potato. Wait, the user is in the kitchen, and the items on the counter include a red hot pepper, a yellow potato, but where is the white tuna? Maybe it's in the fridge? The fridge is mentioned as being present. So the user needs to check the fridge for the white tuna.

But the user hasn't checked the fridge yet. So the next step is to go to the fridge, open it, and take the white tuna. Then, after gathering all ingredients, proceed to chop and roast them as per the recipe. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the current step is to find the white tuna, which is likely in the fridge. So the next action should be to go to the fridge and open it.

Okay, let's break this down. The user needs to follow the recipe steps to cook the meal. So far, they've gathered the red hot pepper, white tuna, and yellow potato. The next step is to chop the red hot pepper. But when they tried to chop it, they were asked to specify the tool. They tried "use knife," but the system said they can't see any such thing. Wait, maybe the knife is already in their inventory? Let me check the previous actions.

The user took the knife from the counter earlier. Wait, in the initial description, the counter has a knife. The user didn't mention taking the knife yet. Oh, right, the user hasn't picked up the knife yet. So when they tried to use the knife, it wasn't in their inventory. So the mistake was not taking the knife first. So the correct step is to take the knife first, then use it to chop the red hot pepper. That makes sense. So the next action should be to take the knife from the counter.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the recipe to cook the meal. The current step is chopping the red hot pepper. They tried using the knife but got an error. The system said "That's not a verb I recognise." So maybe the correct command is "chop" followed by the object and tool. Earlier, they had to use "chop red hot pepper with knife" but that didn't work. Wait, maybe the correct syntax is "chop red hot pepper" and the knife is already in hand. But the user hasn't picked up the knife yet. Wait, they just took the knife from the counter. So now they have the knife. So the next step is to chop the red hot pepper using the knife. The previous attempt was "use knife on red hot pepper" which didn't work. Maybe the correct command is "chop red hot pepper with knife". But the system said "You need to take the red hot pepper first." Wait, but they have the red hot pepper? No, they dropped it earlier. Wait, let me check the history. The user took the red hot pepper, then dropped it. So now they have the knife but not the red hot pepper. So they need to pick up the red hot pepper again. Then use the knife to chop it. So the next step is to take the red hot pepper from the ground where they dropped it. Then chop it with the knife.

Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is trying to cook the meal according to the recipe. The current issue is that they can't find the red hot pepper again after dropping it. They tried taking it from the ground multiple times but got errors. Maybe the red hot pepper is not actually on the ground. Let me check the previous steps.

Earlier, the user took the red hot pepper from the counter, then dropped it when they couldn't carry more items. So the red hot pepper is probably on the ground. But when they try to take it again, the system says "can't see any such thing." Maybe the correct command is to pick it up from the ground, but the system isn't recognizing it. Alternatively, maybe the red hot pepper is still on the counter, and the user just dropped it, but it's not visible. Wait, the user might need to look around again to find it. But the user can't see it, so perhaps the correct action is to pick it up using a different command, like "pick up red hot pepper" instead of "take." Or maybe the system expects a different verb. Since the user is stuck, the next step is to try a different command to pick up the red hot pepper. The previous attempts used "take," but maybe "pick up" is the correct verb here. So the next action should be to pick up the red hot pepper from the ground.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is stuck because they can't pick up the red hot pepper again. They've tried "take" and "pick up" multiple times, but the system isn't recognizing it. Maybe the red hot pepper is not actually on the ground. Let me check the previous steps.

Earlier, the user took the red hot pepper from the counter, then dropped it when they couldn't carry more items. So the red hot pepper is probably on the ground. But when they try to pick it up again, the system says "can't see any such thing." Maybe the correct command is to pick it up from the counter instead of the ground. Or perhaps the system expects a different verb, like "get" instead of "pick up." Alternatively, maybe the red hot pepper is still on the counter, and the user just dropped it, but it's not visible. The user needs to find another way to retrieve it. Since the system isn't recognizing "pick up," maybe the correct action is to use a different verb, like "take" again, but that's been tried. Alternatively, maybe the user should try to chop the pepper without picking it up, but that doesn't make sense. The next step is to try a different command to pick up the red hot pepper, perhaps using a synonym like "get" or "retrieve."

So the next step is to confirm which item they have. The user needs to check their inventory or look around to see which red item they're holding. If they have the red bell pepper, they need to drop it and take the correct one. Alternatively, maybe the system is misidentifying the items. The correct action is to take the red hot pepper again, but the system is prompting for clarification. The user should probably try taking the red hot pepper again, using a different command if necessary.

The problem might be that the user is holding the red bell pepper instead of the red hot pepper. The system is asking which red item they mean. So the next step is to check what the user is holding. If they have the red bell pepper, they need to drop it and take the correct one. Alternatively, maybe the system is misidentifying the items. The correct action is to take the red hot pepper again, but the system is prompting for clarification. The user should probably try a different command, like "get" instead of "take," or check the inventory to see which item they have.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.
