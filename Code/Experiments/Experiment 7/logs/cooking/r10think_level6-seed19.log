-= Bedroom =-
You've just shown up in a bedroom. The room is well lit.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a bed. The bed is large. The bed appears to be empty.

There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.

Well, here we are in the kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You make out an opened fridge. The fridge contains a green bell pepper, a block of cheese, a raw red tuna, a yellow onion, a green hot pepper, a red bell pepper, a red apple, a raw white tuna and a red onion. You see a closed oven, which looks conventional, nearby. You see a table. On the table you see a knife. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You see a counter. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a counter? On the counter you can see a raw purple potato, a green apple, a yellow apple and a cookbook. You make out a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is an open plain door leading west. There is an exit to the east.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to proceed. The user's goal is to cook a delicious meal using the cookbook found in the kitchen. So far, they've navigated through the bedroom, corridor, bathroom, and arrived at the kitchen where they picked up the cookbook. Now, they're back in the bathroom after going north from the corridor.

Wait, the user is in the bathroom again. The previous steps were: go west from the kitchen to the corridor, then north to the bathroom. Now, they need to get back to the kitchen to use the cookbook. But the bathroom's exit is only to the south, which leads back to the corridor. From the corridor, they can go west back to the kitchen. So the next step is to go south from the bathroom to the corridor, then west to the kitchen. But the user is currently in the bathroom, so the immediate next action should be to go south. However, the user might be stuck in a loop between the bathroom and corridor. Let me check the previous moves again.

The user was in the kitchen, took the cookbook, then went east to the corridor. From there, they went north to the bathroom. Now, they need to get back to the kitchen. So from the bathroom, go south to the corridor, then west to the kitchen. But the user is in the bathroom, so the next command should be 'go south' to exit the bathroom and return to the corridor. Then from the corridor, go west to the kitchen. But the user's current location is the bathroom, so the next action is 'go south'.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to cook a meal using the cookbook in the kitchen. They've already found the cookbook and read the recipe, which includes ingredients and directions. The problem is that the user is stuck on the "follow recipe" step, which isn't recognized as a valid command.

First, I need to recall the game's mechanics. The user has to perform actions that the game recognizes. So far, they've navigated through the rooms, taken the cookbook, and read the recipe. The next step would be to follow the recipe's instructions. However, the game doesn't recognize "follow recipe" as a command, so the user needs to use a different verb.

Looking at the recipe directions: dice the cheese, roast the cheese, slice the pepper, fry the pepper, dice the tuna, fry the tuna, then prepare the meal. The user needs to perform these actions. Since "follow recipe" isn't working, maybe the correct command is to "cook" or "prepare" the meal. Alternatively, since the recipe says "prepare meal," maybe that's the command.

But the user is in the kitchen, so the next step is to take the ingredients from the fridge and cook them. The user has the cookbook, so they need to use it to guide the cooking process. The game might expect the user to "cook" the ingredients as per the recipe. Since "follow recipe" isn't valid, the alternative is to "cook" the meal based on the recipe's instructions.

So the next action should be to cook the meal using the ingredients and steps from the recipe. The correct command here would be "cook" or "prepare meal." Since "prepare meal" is in the recipe, that might be the right command. But the game might require a more direct action, like "cook" or "make meal."

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal using the cookbook they found in the kitchen. They've followed the recipe steps, but the game isn't recognizing their commands. The goal is to cook the meal, so they need to execute the recipe's instructions.

First, they need to gather the ingredients from the fridge. The recipe requires block of cheese, green bell pepper, and red tuna. The user has already taken the cookbook, so now they need to collect the ingredients. But in the kitchen description, the fridge is opened and contains those items. So maybe the next step is to take the ingredients from the fridge.

Wait, the user is in the kitchen, and the fridge is opened. They need to take the required ingredients. The recipe says to dice the cheese, roast it, slice the pepper, fry it, dice the tuna, fry it, then prepare the meal. But the game might require them to take the ingredients first. So the user should take the block of cheese, green bell pepper, and red tuna from the fridge.

But the user hasn't done that yet. They just read the recipe. So the next step is to take the ingredients. Then, follow the directions: dice, roast, slice, fry, etc. But the game might not recognize "follow directions" or "cook," so maybe the correct command is to "cook" the meal after gathering the ingredients. Alternatively, they might need to use the stove and oven as per the recipe.

But the user is stuck because the game isn't recognizing their commands. So the correct approach is to take the ingredients first. The user needs to take the block of cheese, green bell pepper, and red tuna from the fridge. Then, use the stove and oven to cook them as per the recipe. The next action should be to take the ingredients from the fridge.

FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to cook a meal using the cookbook. They've already gathered the ingredients: cheese, green bell pepper, and red tuna. They took the knife from the table and diced the cheese. Now, the next step is to roast the cheese as per the recipe.

The recipe says to "roast the block of cheese." The user has the cheese diced, so they need to roast it. The oven is in the kitchen, so they should use the oven. The command would be to roast the diced cheese in the oven. But the game might require a specific verb. Since "roast" is a valid action, the next step is to roast the cheese.

Wait, the user just diced the cheese, so they need to put it in the oven. The correct command is "roast block of cheese" or "roast diced cheese." But the game might expect "roast" as the verb. So the next action is to roast the cheese.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to roast the block of cheese in the oven. The game isn't recognizing the command. They've already taken the ingredients and the knife, diced the cheese. The next step is to roast it. But the correct verb might be "put in oven" or "heat in oven". Since "roast" isn't working, maybe the action is to place the cheese in the oven.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

<think>
Okay, the user is stuck trying to roast the cheese in the oven. They've tried multiple commands, but the game isn't recognizing them. Let me think about the steps again.

First, the goal is to cook the meal using the recipe from the cookbook. They've gathered the ingredients: cheese, green bell pepper, red tuna. They took the knife, diced the cheese, put it in the oven. Now, the next step is to roast the cheese. But the game isn't accepting "roast" or "heat".

Maybe the correct action is to "put the cheese in the oven" again, but they already did that. Alternatively, maybe the oven needs to be preheated. The user opened the oven, put the cheese in, but maybe they need to "heat" the oven. But "heat" isn't working either.

Wait, the recipe says "roast the block of cheese". The user has the cheese in the oven. Maybe the game expects the command "roast" without specifying the oven. But previous attempts showed that "roast block of cheese" isn't recognized. Maybe the correct verb is "cook" or "bake". But the recipe says "roast".

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "start" the roasting process. The game might not recognize "roast" but accepts "start". But the user tried "start roasting" and it wasn't recognized. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "use the oven" to roast the cheese. But that's not a verb. The game might be expecting a different command. Since all previous attempts are failing, perhaps the correct action is to "cook the cheese" even though the recipe says roast. But that's a guess.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "turn on the oven" to start roasting. But "turn on" might not be the right verb. The oven is already open, so maybe "heat" is the correct verb, but it's not working. This is tricky. The user is in a loop, so the next step is to try a different synonym for the action. Maybe "bake" instead of "roast". But the recipe specifies roast. Alternatively, "cook" the cheese. Let's try "cook block of cheese".
