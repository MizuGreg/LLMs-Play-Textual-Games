You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You're now in the kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You can make out a fridge. The fridge contains a raw white tuna, a raw pork chop, a block of cheese, a carrot, a red bell pepper, a white onion, a raw red tuna and a lettuce. You see a closed oven. You make out a table. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You can see a counter. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a counter, go to TextWorld. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a tomato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal in the kitchen. The goal is to check the cookbook for a recipe, then use the ingredients to make a dish.

First, they were in the kitchen and found the cookbook on the counter. They tried to open it but couldn't. Then they took the cookbook from the counter. Now, they're trying to open it again, but it's not working. 

So the first step is to find the recipe. They already took the cookbook, but maybe it's not openable directly. Maybe they need to read it instead of opening it. The next step would be to look through the cookbook to find a recipe. Since the previous action of opening didn't work, perhaps the correct action is to read or check the cookbook instead. 

The user is in a loop because they keep trying to open it, which isn't possible. The next action should be to read the cookbook to find the recipe. So the command should be "read the cookbook".

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to cook a meal using the ingredients from the kitchen. They followed the recipe from the cookbook, which requires slicing the red hot pepper and white tuna, then frying and roasting them.

So far, they've taken the knife from the counter. The next step should be to slice the red hot pepper using the knife. But the user tried "slice the red hot pepper" and was told they need a knife. They already took the knife, so now they should use it to slice the pepper. 

Wait, the previous action was taking the knife, so the next logical step is to use the knife on the pepper. The user might be stuck because they need to apply the knife to the pepper. The command should be "slice the red hot pepper with the knife" or similar. But since the system might not recognize "with the knife," maybe just "slice the red hot pepper" again, as the knife is already in hand. But the system said "Cutting something requires a knife," implying the knife is needed. So the correct action is to use the knife on the pepper. The next command should be "slice the red hot pepper" again, since the knife is available.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe in the cookbook. The current step is slicing the red hot pepper, but they need a knife. They already took the knife from the counter. The previous attempt to slice the pepper was denied because the knife wasn't used.

So, the goal is to follow the recipe: slice the red hot pepper and white tuna, then fry and roast them. The user has the knife now. The next step should be to use the knife on the pepper. The command "use the knife on the red hot pepper" wasn't recognized. Maybe the correct verb is "slice" with the knife. But the system might require a different phrasing. Alternatively, maybe "cut the red hot pepper with the knife" or "cut the red hot pepper". Since "slice" was tried before, perhaps "cut" is the correct verb here. So the next action should be "cut the red hot pepper" to proceed.

SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user's goal is to cook a meal using the recipe from the cookbook. They've already taken the cookbook, found the recipe, and started preparing ingredients. The current step is to slice the red hot pepper, but they needed to take it from the counter first. They did that, so now they have the pepper. The next step is to use the knife to slice it. The previous attempts to slice it were unsuccessful because the knife wasn't used properly. Now that the pepper is in hand, the correct action is to slice it with the knife. The command should be "slice the red hot pepper with the knife".
</think>slice the red hot pepper with the knife
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

You slice the red hot pepper.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the recipe to cook a meal. They've already sliced the red hot pepper and now need to fry it. The previous attempts to use "fry" didn't work, so maybe the correct verb is "cook" or "heat". The stove is available, so the next step is to use the stove to cook the pepper. The command should be "cook the red hot pepper on the stove" but since that's not working, maybe "heat the red hot pepper on the stove". Alternatively, "fry the red hot pepper with the stove" but the system says that's not a verb. The correct action is to use the stove to fry it, so the command should be "fry the red hot pepper with the stove" but since that's not recognized, maybe "cook the red hot pepper on the stove".

FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, the user is stuck again. They've followed the recipe steps: sliced the red hot pepper, fried it, roasted the white tuna. Now, the final step is to prepare the meal. The system isn't recognizing any of the verbs like "prepare", "serve", "assemble", etc. The goal is to cook a meal using the ingredients. Maybe the correct action is to "eat the meal" but that's not it. Alternatively, "finish the meal" but that's not a verb. The user needs to use the ingredients they've prepared. The correct command might be "make the meal" or "cook the meal". Since the system isn't recognizing "prepare", maybe "make" is the right verb. So the next action is "make the meal".

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, the user is stuck again. They've followed the recipe steps: sliced the red hot pepper, fried it, roasted the white tuna. Now, the final step is to prepare the meal. The system isn't recognizing any of the verbs like "prepare", "serve", "assemble", etc. The goal is to cook a meal using the ingredients. Maybe the correct action is to "eat the meal" but that's not it. Alternatively, "finish the meal" but that's not a verb. The user needs to use the ingredients they've prepared. The correct command might be "make the meal" or "cook the meal". Since the system isn't recognizing "prepare", maybe "make" is the right verb. So the next action is "make the meal".
