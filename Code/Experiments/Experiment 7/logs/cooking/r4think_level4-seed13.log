You see an opened fridge. What a letdown! The fridge is empty! You make out a closed oven right there by you. Look over there! a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Look over there! a counter. You see a raw yellow potato, a yellow onion, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty. You move on, clearly depressed by your TextWorld experience.

There is an open plain door leading south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal based on the cookbook. The goal is to find the recipe, gather ingredients, and cook something.

First, they went from the pantry to the kitchen. In the kitchen, they found a cookbook on the counter, took it, and then went back to the pantry. Now they're back in the pantry again, but the shelf is empty. The problem is that they need to use the cookbook to find the recipe, but they might not have the ingredients yet.

Wait, in the kitchen, there were ingredients listed: raw yellow potato, yellow onion, raw purple potato, a cookbook, and a knife. The user took the cookbook but didn't mention taking the ingredients. So maybe the next step is to collect the ingredients. But the pantry is empty, so maybe the ingredients are in the kitchen. However, when they went south (back to pantry), they didn't take any ingredients. So perhaps they need to go back to the kitchen, collect the ingredients, then use the cookbook to make a dish.

But the user is currently in the pantry again. The previous action was going south, which brought them back. Now, they need to go back north to the kitchen, take the ingredients, and then follow the recipe. But the user might be stuck in a loop between pantry and kitchen. So the next action should be to go north again to the kitchen, then take the ingredients. But the user already took the cookbook, so maybe the next step is to go back to the kitchen, take the potatoes and onion, then use the cookbook to cook. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the correct next step is to go north again to the kitchen, then take the ingredients.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to cook a meal using the cookbook. So far, they've collected the cookbook, the three potatoes, and the knife. The next step is to use the cookbook to find a recipe and then cook something with the ingredients.

Wait, in the kitchen, there's a closed oven and a stove. The user has the ingredients, so they need to follow the recipe. But the cookbook is already taken. Maybe they need to open the cookbook to find the recipe. But earlier, when they tried to open it, it wasn't something you could open. But maybe now that they have it, they can read it. Alternatively, maybe they need to use the stove or oven to cook the ingredients.

But the user hasn't used the cookbook yet. The previous actions were taking items, so the next logical step is to open the cookbook to find the recipe. However, the user tried to open it before and it wasn't possible. But maybe now that they have it, they can read it. Alternatively, maybe the cookbook is already in their inventory, so they can use it to find the recipe. Once they have the recipe, they can cook the ingredients using the stove or oven. So the next action should be to open the cookbook to get the recipe, then use the ingredients and tools to cook.

So far, they've collected the ingredients (yellow potato, yellow onion, purple potato, knife) and the cookbook. They read the recipe, which says to dice the yellow potato, fry it, and prepare the meal. The problem is that the user tried to "fry yellow potato" but it wasn't recognized. Then they tried "cook yellow potato" and were asked what to cook it with.

Wait, the recipe says "dice the yellow potato" and "fry the yellow potato". So maybe the user needs to use the knife to dice the potato first. Then use the stove or oven to fry it. But the stove is empty. Maybe they need to use the knife to prepare the potato, then use the stove's heat to fry it. But the user hasn't used the knife yet beyond taking it. So the next step is to use the knife on the yellow potato to dice it. Then proceed to fry it using the stove. But the user might be stuck because they need to use the correct verbs. Instead of "fry", maybe "heat" the stove and then "fry" the potato. Alternatively, use the stove's function. So the next action should be to use the knife on the potato to dice it, then use the stove to cook it.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to cook a meal using the cookbook. They've collected the ingredients and the cookbook. The recipe says to dice the yellow potato, fry it, and prepare the meal. The user has tried various actions like using the knife on the potato but kept getting errors.

So far, they've taken the cookbook, all the potatoes, and the knife. They read the recipe, which requires dicing the potato. The problem is that the system isn't recognizing the correct verbs. Instead of "dice," maybe "cut" is the right verb. But the user tried "cut" and it didn't work. Alternatively, maybe they need to use the knife to prepare the potato first. Since the previous actions didn't work, the next step should be to use the knife on the potato to dice it, even if the system isn't recognizing it. Alternatively, maybe the correct action is to "prepare" the potato. But the user needs to follow the recipe steps. The next logical step is to use the knife to dice the potato, even if the system is having issues with the verb. So the command would be "use knife on yellow potato" again, but since that didn't work, maybe "cut yellow potato" or "dice yellow potato" with the knife. But the system says "That's not a verb I recognise." So maybe the correct action is to "cut" the potato with the knife. But the user has to use the correct syntax. Maybe "cut yellow potato with knife" or "cut yellow potato". But the system doesn't recognize "cut" as a verb here. So the next step is to try a different approach, perhaps using the stove to cook the potato after dicing it. But the user hasn't diced it yet. So the next action should be to use the knife to dice the potato, even if the system is not recognizing the verb. The correct command would be "use knife on yellow potato" again, but since that didn't work, maybe "dice yellow potato" without the knife. But the recipe says to use the knife. So the final attempt is to use the knife on the potato to dice it, even if the system is having issues.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe. They've diced the yellow potato, but now they need to fry it. The previous attempts to use verbs like "fry" or "heat" didn't work. The system might be expecting a different command structure.

So far, they've collected all ingredients, read the recipe, diced the potato. The next step is to cook it. Since "fry" isn't working, maybe the correct action is to use the stove's function. The stove is conventional, so perhaps "cook" is the verb. Alternatively, "heat" the stove and then "fry" the potato. But the system says "heat stove" isn't a verb. Maybe the correct command is "use stove to cook yellow potato". But the user tried that and it didn't work. Alternatively, "put yellow potato on stove" to cook it. Since the recipe says to fry, maybe the correct action is "fry yellow potato", but the system doesn't recognize it. So the next step is to use the stove's function to cook the potato, even if the verb is different. The correct command might be "cook yellow potato with stove" or "heat stove and fry potato". But since the system isn't recognizing "fry", maybe the answer is to use the stove to cook it directly. The next action should be "cook yellow potato on stove".
