Well how about that, you are in the place we're calling the bedroom.

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a bed. The bed is large. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

There is a closed plain door leading south. There is an exit to the west.

FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the cookbook in the kitchen. They've already opened the cookbook, but the system said it isn't something you can open. Wait, maybe I need to check the previous steps again.

First, the goal is to find the recipe in the kitchen, use the cookbook, and then cook. The user went from bedroom to living room, then corridor, then kitchen. In the kitchen, they saw a cookbook on the table. The user tried to open it, but the system said it's not possible. Maybe the cookbook is already openable, or perhaps the user needs to pick it up first?

Wait, the initial instruction was to "check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe." So maybe the user needs to pick up the cookbook first. But the user tried to open it, which might not be the right action. The correct step might be to take the cookbook, then open it. But the system said "It isn't something you can open," so maybe the cookbook is already open, or the user needs to read it instead?

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to look at the cookbook to find the recipe. But the system's response was that opening it isn't possible. So perhaps the next step is to take the cookbook, then look at it. But the user's last action was "open cookbook," which failed. So the next action should be to take the cookbook instead. Let me check the available objects in the kitchen: there's a cookbook and a knife on the table. So the user needs to take the cookbook first, then maybe open it. But the system said opening isn't possible. Maybe the cookbook is already open, so the user needs to read it. But the game might require the user to open it first. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the cookbook to find the recipe, which would involve looking at it. But the system's message says that opening isn't possible, so perhaps the user needs to take the cookbook first. So the next action should be "take cookbook" instead of opening it. That makes sense. So the user should take the cookbook, then maybe open it. But the system said opening isn't possible, so maybe the user needs to read it. But the correct action here is to take the cookbook first. So the next command should be "take cookbook".

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to cook a meal using the cookbook in the kitchen. They've already taken the cookbook and looked at it, which gave them the recipe. Now, they need to gather the ingredients and follow the directions.

Looking at the ingredients listed: lettuce, red tuna, and tomato. The user is in the kitchen, which has a fridge, oven, stove, and counter. They need to collect the ingredients. The tomato is already on the counter, but they need to check if the lettuce and red tuna are available. Wait, the fridge is closed. Maybe they need to open the fridge to get the lettuce and tuna. But the user hasn't opened the fridge yet. The recipe says to slice the lettuce, roast it, etc. So the next step is to gather the ingredients. Let's check the available actions. The user can open the fridge, take the lettuce and tuna from there, then proceed to cook them according to the recipe. The previous actions were taking the cookbook and looking at it, which provided the recipe. Now, the next step is to open the fridge to get the ingredients. But the user might have already opened the fridge? Wait, in the current scene, the fridge is closed. So the user needs to open it. But the user's last action was looking at the cookbook. So the next action should be to open the fridge to get the ingredients. However, the user might need to take the ingredients first. Alternatively, maybe the lettuce is on the counter, but the recipe says to slice it, so maybe it's already there. Wait, the tomato is on the counter, but the lettuce and tuna might be in the fridge. So the user needs to open the fridge, take the lettuce and tuna, then proceed to cook them. The directions mention roasting the lettuce and tuna, so the user needs to use the oven. But the oven is closed. So the steps are: open fridge, take lettuce and tuna, open oven, roast them, then fry the tuna, dice the tomato, roast the tomato, and prepare the meal. But the user is currently in the kitchen, so the next immediate action is to open the fridge. However, the user might have already done that. Wait, the initial description of the kitchen says the fridge is closed. So the user needs to open it. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action should be to open the fridge. But the user's previous action was looking at the cookbook. So the correct next step is to open the fridge to get the ingredients. But the user might have to take the ingredients from there. So the next command is "open fridge".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal using the recipe from the cookbook. They've taken the cookbook and looked at it, which gave them the ingredients: lettuce, red tuna, and tomato. But when they tried to take all three, the system only recognized taking the lettuce. So maybe they need to take each item one by one.

Wait, the user's last action was "take lettuce red tuna tomato", but the system only understood "lettuce". So perhaps the correct approach is to take each ingredient separately. The recipe says to slice the lettuce, roast it, etc. So maybe the user needs to take the lettuce first, then the red tuna, then the tomato. But the system is not allowing them to take multiple items at once. So the next step is to take the lettuce first. Then, after that, take the red tuna and tomato individually. But the user might be stuck in a loop because they keep trying to take all three together. The system is probably expecting each item to be taken separately. So the next action should be to take the lettuce again, then proceed to take the red tuna and tomato one by one. But the user has already tried that. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use different commands for each item. So the correct next step is to take the lettuce, then take the red tuna, then take the tomato. But the system is only allowing one at a time. So the answer is to take the lettuce again, then the red tuna, then the tomato. But the user is getting stuck because they keep trying to take all three. So the next action should be to take the lettuce again, then proceed step by step.

Okay, let's see. The user's goal is to cook a meal using the recipe from the cookbook. They've already gathered the ingredients: lettuce, red tuna, and tomato. Now, they need to follow the directions in the recipe. The next step is to prepare the ingredients as per the recipe.

The recipe says to slice the lettuce, roast the lettuce, chop the red tuna, fry the red tuna, dice the tomato, roast the tomato, and then prepare the meal. So the user needs to perform each of these actions in order. 

Looking at the current scene, the user has the ingredients. The next action would be to slice the lettuce. But the user might need to use the knife from the table. Wait, in the kitchen, there's a knife on the table. So maybe the user needs to take the knife first. But the user hasn't done that yet. However, the recipe says to slice the lettuce, so the next step is to slice it. But the user might need to use the knife to slice it. So the correct action is to slice the lettuce. But the system might require the user to take the knife first. Alternatively, the user can directly slice the lettuce with the knife. But the user's previous actions were taking the ingredients. Now, the next step is to process the ingredients according to the recipe. So the next command should be to slice the lettuce. But the user might need to use the knife. However, the system might accept "slice lettuce" as the command. Let me check the previous interactions. The user has the ingredients, so the next step is to follow the recipe's directions.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook the meal according to the recipe. They've sliced the lettuce, but now they need to roast it. The system isn't recognizing "roast lettuce" as a valid command. Maybe the correct verb is "roast" followed by the object. But the user tried "roast lettuce" and it didn't work. Maybe they need to use a different form, like "roast the lettuce" with the article. But the system said that's not a verb. Wait, maybe the action is to put the lettuce in the oven. The recipe says to roast the lettuce, so the user needs to use the oven. The oven is closed, so they need to open it first. But the user hasn't opened the oven yet. So the next step is to open the oven, then put the lettuce inside to roast it. Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "put lettuce in oven" or "roast lettuce in oven".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to roast the lettuce in the oven. The system isn't recognizing "roast lettuce" or similar commands. Maybe the correct action is to use the verb "roast" with the object "the lettuce" and specify the oven. But since the oven is already open and the lettuce is inside, perhaps the next step is to wait for it to roast. But the game might require an explicit action. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the stove instead. Wait, the recipe says to roast the lettuce, which is typically done in an oven. But if the oven is the only option, maybe the user needs to "put the lettuce in the oven" and then "roast it". But the system is not accepting "roast" as a verb here. Maybe the correct command is "heat oven" or "turn on oven". But the user already opened the oven. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "cook the lettuce" instead of "roast". But the recipe specifies roasting. Since the oven is open and the lettuce is inside, perhaps the next step is to wait, but the game might require an action. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "close the oven" to trap the heat. But that's not usual. Wait, the user has already put the lettuce in the oven. Maybe the next step is to "roast the lettuce" using the oven's function. But the system isn't recognizing it. Maybe the correct command is "roast the lettuce in the oven". But the system says that's not a verb. Maybe the user needs to use a different verb like "bake" instead of "roast". But the recipe says roast. This is confusing. The user needs to follow the recipe's directions, so the next step is to roast the lettuce in the oven. Since the system isn't recognizing "roast", maybe the correct action is to "heat the oven" or "cook the lettuce". But the user already put it in. Maybe the game expects the user to "close the oven" to trap the heat. But that's not standard. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "leave the lettuce in the oven" to roast. But the system might not accept that. I'm stuck. The user needs to proceed with the recipe steps, so the next action is to roast the lettuce in the oven, even if the system isn't recognizing the verb. Maybe the correct command is "roast the lettuce".

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to cook a meal using the recipe from the cookbook. They've gathered the ingredients: lettuce, red tuna, and tomato. They sliced the lettuce and put it in the oven. Now, they need to follow the recipe's directions: roast the lettuce, chop the red tuna, fry the red tuna, dice the tomato, roast the tomato, and prepare the meal.

The user has tried to roast the lettuce but the system isn't recognizing the verb. They tried "roast the lettuce" and "heat the oven", but it's not working. Maybe the correct action is to use the stove instead of the oven for some steps. The recipe says to fry the red tuna, which is typically done on the stove. So perhaps the user needs to use the stove for frying. Alternatively, maybe the oven is already hot, and the lettuce is roasting on its own. But the game might require an explicit action. Since the user can't roast the lettuce, maybe they need to move on to the next step in the recipe, like chopping the red tuna. The user has the red tuna, so they can chop it using the knife. Then fry it on the stove. After that, dice the tomato and roast it. Finally, prepare the meal. The next step should be to chop the red tuna.

Okay, the user is trying to cook the red tuna on the stove. They've put it on the stove, but the system is asking what to cook it with. The problem is that there's no pan or cooking utensil available. The game might expect the user to use the stove directly. The next step is to cook the tuna on the stove. The correct action is to cook it, even without a pan. The user needs to proceed with the recipe's steps. So the next command is to cook the red tuna on the stove.

Okay, the user has fried the red tuna. Now, the next step in the recipe is to dice the tomato. The user has the tomato on the counter. So the next action is to dice the tomato. The correct command is "dice tomato". Let's check if that's the next step. The recipe says to dice the tomato after roasting it, but the user hasn't roasted the tomato yet. Wait, the recipe steps are: slice lettuce, roast lettuce, chop red tuna, fry red tuna, dice tomato, roast tomato, prepare meal. So after frying the tuna, the next is to dice the tomato. The user needs to take the tomato and dice it. The command should be "dice tomato".

Okay, the user needs to roast the tomato next. They've diced the tomato, but the system isn't recognizing "roast" as a verb. Maybe the correct action is to use the oven again. The tomato is on the counter, so the user needs to put it in the oven. The command should be "put tomato in oven" or "roast tomato in oven". But the system says "roast" isn't a verb. Alternatively, the user can use the stove. But the recipe says to roast the tomato, which is typically done in an oven. So the next step is to put the tomato in the oven. The correct command is "put tomato in oven".

Okay, the user is trying to roast the tomato in the oven. They've put it in the oven, but the system isn't recognizing "roast" as a verb. The next step is to wait for the tomato to roast, but the game might require an explicit action. Since the user can't use "roast", maybe they need to use "heat" or "cook". But the recipe says to roast. The correct action is to roast the tomato in the oven. The system might accept "roast tomato in oven" even if it's not a verb. Alternatively, the user can just leave it in the oven, but the game requires a command. So the next step is to roast the tomato in the oven.

Okay, the user is stuck trying to heat the oven. They've tried "heat oven" multiple times, but the system isn't recognizing it. The goal is to cook the meal according to the recipe. The user has already prepared the lettuce, red tuna, and tomato. The next step is to prepare the meal. Since the oven is already open and the tomato is inside, maybe the user needs to take the cooked items and assemble the meal. The correct action is to "prepare meal" or "assemble meal".

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.
