You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You've just walked into a kitchen.

You make out an opened conventional looking fridge in the room. The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, a yellow onion and a green bell pepper. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You see a closed oven. You can see a table. You see a cookbook on the table. You can see a counter. You see a raw red potato, a red bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife on the counter. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal, so the goal is to find a recipe and cook something. They checked the cookbook but it wasn't openable. Then they looked around, under the table, counter, stove, and fridge. The fridge had veggies, but nothing else. Now they're stuck because they can't open the cookbook.

First step: The goal is to find a recipe, gather ingredients, and cook. So far, they checked the fridge for ingredients but didn't find the cookbook open. They looked around but didn't find anything else. Next step should be to find another way to access the cookbook or find ingredients.

Second step: They already checked the fridge, table, counter, stove, and under those places. The cookbook is on the table but closed. Maybe they need to look for a different way to open it, like using the knife or another tool. Alternatively, maybe the recipe is in another location.

Third step: They kept looking in the same places without success. Maybe they need to try a different approach, like using the knife on the cookbook to open it. Since the previous actions didn't work, changing the method is necessary.

Final action: Use the knife on the cookbook to open it. That's a new approach and might break the loop of checking the same spots.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal, so the main goal is to find a recipe and cook something. They checked the cookbook but it was closed. Then they looked around the kitchen, under the table, counter, stove, and fridge, but didn't find anything else. The fridge had veggies, but no recipe.

First step: The goal is to find a recipe, gather ingredients, and cook. So far, they checked the fridge for ingredients but didn't find the cookbook open. They looked around but didn't find anything else. Next step should be to find another way to access the cookbook or find ingredients.

Final action: Use the knife on the cookbook. But the system keeps saying that's not a verb. Maybe the correct action is to "open the cookbook" or "use the knife to open the cookbook". But the user tried "use knife on cookbook" and it's not recognized. Maybe the correct command is "open cookbook" again, but the system said it wasn't openable. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "pick up the knife" first, then use it on the cookbook. But the user hasn't picked up the knife yet. Wait, the knife is on the counter. So maybe the steps are: pick up the knife, then use it on the cookbook. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action should be to pick up the knife, then use it to open the cookbook. But the user is stuck in a loop of trying to open the cookbook. So the correct next step is to pick up the knife first.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to cook a meal, so they need a recipe and ingredients. They checked the fridge for veggies but didn't find the recipe. The cookbook is on the table but closed. They tried using the knife on it, but it didn't work. Now they're stuck again.

First step: The goal is to find a recipe (cookbook), gather ingredients, and cook. So far, they found some veggies in the fridge but couldn't open the cookbook. They picked up the knife but couldn't use it to open the book.

Second step: They've checked the fridge, table, counter, stove, and under those places. The cookbook is closed, and the knife isn't helping. The next step should be to find another way to open the cookbook or look for ingredients elsewhere.

Third step: They're in a loop of trying to open the cookbook without success. The previous actions didn't work, so they need a different approach. Maybe the cookbook can't be opened with the knife, so they need to find another method, like using a different tool or looking for a key. Alternatively, maybe the recipe is in another location they haven't checked.

Final action: Since the knife isn't working, maybe the correct action is to "look at the cookbook" to see if there's a way to open it, or "use the knife on the cookbook" again, but the system says that's not a verb. Wait, maybe the correct command is "open the cookbook" again, but the system said it's not openable. Alternatively, maybe they need to "pick up the cookbook" first, but it's already on the table. Hmm. The user has to try a different synonym for "open," like "unzip" or "unlock," but those might not apply. Alternatively, maybe the cookbook is a book that needs to be opened manually, so the correct action is "open cookbook" again, even though the system said it's not openable. But the user tried that and it didn't work. So maybe the next step is to look for another way to get the recipe, like using the ingredients from the fridge to make a dish, even without the recipe. But the game requires the recipe. So the correct next step is to try opening the cookbook again, even if it's not working, or find another way.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe in the cookbook. They've already found the recipe, which requires a red potato and a yellow bell pepper. The first step was to chop the red potato, but they kept getting errors because they didn't use the knife correctly.

First, the goal is to follow the recipe steps: chop the red potato, fry it, slice the yellow bell pepper, roast it, and prepare the meal. So far, they've tried to chop the red potato but failed because they didn't use the knife properly. The next step should be to actually use the knife on the potato to chop it.

Second, the past actions include opening the cookbook, finding the ingredients, and attempting to chop the potato with the knife. The issue is that the command "chop red potato" isn't working because it requires the knife. The user needs to use the knife on the potato to chop it.

Third, they're in a loop of trying to chop the potato without success. The correct action is to use the knife on the red potato. Since previous attempts to use "chop" didn't work, the synonym "cut" might be better. But the system might accept "chop" if the knife is used. Wait, the error message says "Cutting something requires a knife," so the user needs to use the knife on the potato. The correct command is "use knife on red potato" but that was previously rejected. Alternatively, maybe "cut red potato with knife" but that's not a valid command. The system might expect "chop red potato" with the knife already picked up. Since the user has the knife, the next step is to chop the potato using the knife.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe. They've already chopped the red potato and need to fry it. The previous attempts to use the stove on the potato didn't work. The error messages suggest that the commands aren't recognized.

First, the goal is to follow the recipe steps: chop the red potato, fry it, slice the yellow bell pepper, roast it, and prepare the meal. So far, they've chopped the potato. Next is frying it.

Second, the past actions include taking the red potato, using the knife to chop it. Now, they need to fry it. The issue is that "fry" isn't working. Maybe the correct command is "put on stove" or "heat stove" but that didn't work. Alternatively, "cook on stove" or "use stove to fry".

Third, they're stuck in a loop of trying to fry the potato. The system doesn't recognize "fry" or "use stove on". Maybe the correct action is "put red potato on stove" or "place on stove". Since "use stove on" didn't work, trying a different phrasing like "put on stove" might be better.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe. They've already chopped the red potato and put it on the stove. The next step is to fry it. But the system isn't recognizing "fry" or "use stove on". They tried "put red potato on stove" again, but it's not working.

First, the goal is to follow the recipe: chop the potato, fry it, slice the bell pepper, roast it, and prepare the meal. So far, they've chopped the potato and put it on the stove. Now, they need to fry it.

Second, the past actions include taking the potato, chopping it, and putting it on the stove. The issue is that "fry" isn't working. Maybe the correct command is "heat stove" or "cook on stove". But the system says "use stove on" isn't a verb. Alternatively, maybe "cook" is the verb here.

Third, they're in a loop of trying to fry the potato. The system doesn't recognize "fry" or "use stove on". The correct action might be "cook red potato on stove" or "heat stove to fry". Since "fry" isn't working, maybe "cook" is the right verb. But the user has to use the stove. So the next step is to use the stove to cook the potato.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe. They've already chopped the red potato, fried it, sliced the yellow bell pepper, and now need to roast it. The previous attempts to roast the pepper using the stove didn't work. The system isn't recognizing the commands like "roast" or "use stove on".

First, the goal is to follow the recipe steps: chop the red potato, fry it, slice the yellow bell pepper, roast it, and prepare the meal. So far, they've done the first three steps. Now, they need to roast the yellow bell pepper.

Second, the past actions include taking the yellow bell pepper, slicing it, and putting it on the stove. The issue is that "roast" isn't working. Maybe the correct command is "heat stove" or "cook on stove". But the system says "use stove on" isn't a verb. Alternatively, maybe "put on stove" again.

Third, they're in a loop of trying to roast the pepper. The system doesn't recognize "roast" or "use stove on". The correct action might be "put yellow bell pepper on stove" again, but that was already tried. Alternatively, "cook yellow bell pepper on stove" or "heat stove to roast". Since "roast" isn't working, maybe "cook" is the verb here.
