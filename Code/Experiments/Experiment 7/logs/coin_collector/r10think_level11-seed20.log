THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in TextWorld based on the given instructions. The goal is to lift the coin from the scullery and win. Let me break down the steps they've taken so far.

First, they started in the bar, went north to the basement, then north again to the launderette. From there, they went north to the sauna, then east to the garage. From the garage, they went north to the cubicle, then north again to the salon. Now, they're in the salon, and the next step according to the initial instructions was to venture west after moving north. But the salon's description says to go west. However, the user's last action was going north from the cubicle to the salon. The current room is the salon, and the next step should be to go west. But the user might be stuck in a loop if they keep going north and south. Wait, the salon has an exit to the south and suggests going west. So the next step should be west. Let me check the previous steps to ensure they haven't repeated actions. The user has gone north multiple times, but the salon's instruction says to go west. So the next action should be west. But the user might have already done that? Wait, no, the last action was going north to the salon. So the next step is to go west from the salon. That should lead them to the next room. Then, after that, they need to move north again and then west, then south, and finally lift the coin. But the user needs to make sure they don't loop. Since the salon's exit is west, going west is the next step. So the correct next action is west.
