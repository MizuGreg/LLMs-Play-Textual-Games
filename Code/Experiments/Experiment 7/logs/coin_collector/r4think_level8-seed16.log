Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. Your first objective is to make an attempt to venture west. With that done, head south. And then, go east. And then, make an attempt to venture east. If you can do that, attempt to move east. After that, try to go to the north. Okay, and then, head west. Then, retrieve the coin from the floor of the office. That's it!

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let me try to figure out how to solve this game. The user's goal is to venture west, then south, east, east again, north, west, and finally retrieve the coin from the office. 

Looking at the current environment, the user is in the Dish-Pit. The previous steps were: go west from Steam Room to Studio, then south to Dish-Pit. Now, the next step according to the initial instructions is to go east from the Dish-Pit. But the prompt says there's an unguarded exit to the east. So maybe the next move is to go east.

Wait, but the user is in the Dish-Pit, and the instruction says to try going north. The user might be stuck in a loop if they keep going back and forth. Let me check the previous steps again. The user started by going west, then south, then east (from Dish-Pit). Wait, no, the user was in the Dish-Pit, and the prompt says there's an exit to the east. So the next step should be to go east. But the user's last action was going south to Dish-Pit, and now they need to go east. But the user might be in a loop if they keep moving between rooms without progress. However, the initial instructions say to go east from the Dish-Pit. So the next action should be go east. But maybe the user is supposed to go north instead? The prompt says "You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked." So maybe the user should go north instead of east. But the original plan was to go east after south. Hmm. Wait, the initial instructions were: venture west, then south, then east, then east again, then north, then west, then retrieve the coin. So after going south to Dish-Pit, the next step is east. But the user is in Dish-Pit, and the prompt says there's an exit to the east. So go east. But maybe the user is in a loop, so they need to find another way. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go north from Dish-Pit. But according to the initial plan, after south, the next is east. So the correct next step is east. But the user might be stuck in a loop, so they need to try a different action. But the user's last action was going south, so the next should be east. But the prompt says that in Dish-Pit, there's an exit to the east, so go east. Then, after that, maybe the next steps would be to go east again, then north, etc. So the next action is go east.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to follow a specific sequence of directions: west, south, east, east, north, west, then get the coin. So far, they've gone west (Steam Room), south (Studio), south again (Dish-Pit), east (Cubicle), and then east again (Kitchenette). Now, the next step in the original plan was to go north from the Kitchenette. But the current prompt says there's an exit to the east and west. The user is in the Kitchenette, and the advice is to try going west. However, the original plan after the second east was to go north. But maybe the user is stuck in a loop between east and west. The previous actions didn't progress towards the coin, so they need to try a different direction. Since the prompt suggests going west, but the original plan was north, maybe the user needs to go north instead. But the current environment says the exit to the east is unblocked. Wait, the user is in the Kitchenette, and the prompt says "You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west." So the next action should be west. But according to the original plan, after the second east (Kitchenette), the next was north. However, the user might be in a loop between east and west. So the correct next step is to go west. But the original plan says north. Hmm, maybe the user needs to go north instead of west. But the current prompt says west is unblocked. So the user should go west. But that might not be part of the original plan. Wait, the original steps were: after going east (from Dish-Pit), then east again (to Kitchenette), then north. But the current prompt says to go west. So perhaps the user is in a loop, and needs to try a different action. The previous actions didn't make progress, so the user should try a different direction. The next action should be north, even though the prompt suggests west. But the user needs to follow the original plan. So the next step is north. But the current environment says to go west. So maybe the user is in a loop and needs to go west instead of north. But the original plan says north. This is confusing. The correct next step according to the original plan is north, but the current environment suggests west. So the user needs to go north, even if the prompt says west. But the user must follow the environment's cues. The prompt says "You should try going west." So the next action is west. But that might not be part of the original plan. However, the user must follow the environment's directions. So the next action is west.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Cubicle and Kitchenette. They keep going east and west, which isn't progressing towards the coin. The original plan was to go west, south, east, east, north, west, then get the coin. But they've been bouncing between east and west without moving forward. The next step should be to break the loop. Since the previous actions (east/west) aren't working, maybe they need to try a different direction, like north. But the current environment says to go west. Wait, the user needs to retrieve the coin from the office. Maybe they're not in the right area yet. The loop is between Cubicle and Kitchenette, so they need to find another exit. The prompt says there's an exit to the east and west, but maybe they need to go north instead. However, the current environment doesn't mention north. The user must try a different action, like north, even if it's not suggested. So the next action should be north to escape the loop and proceed towards the office.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Cubicle and Kitchenette, repeatedly going east and west. The original goal was to venture west, then south, east, east, north, west, and retrieve the coin. But they've been moving back and forth without progressing. The next step should be to break the loop. Since going east and west isn't working, maybe they need to try a different direction, like north, even though the environment says to go west. But the user can't go north directly. Alternatively, maybe they need to find another exit. The key is to avoid repeating the same actions. The next action should be to go north, even if it's not suggested, to escape the loop and proceed towards the office where the coin is.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.
