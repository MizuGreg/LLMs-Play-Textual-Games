Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First thing I need you to do is to make an attempt to venture west. Then, travel west. If you can accomplish that, retrieve the coin from the floor of the garage. Got that? Good!

-= Laundry Place =-
You've entered a laundry place.



There is an unguarded exit to the west.

-= Cubicle =-
You've just sauntered into a cubicle.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.
