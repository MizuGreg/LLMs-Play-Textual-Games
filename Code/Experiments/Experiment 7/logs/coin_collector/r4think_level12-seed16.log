THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and pick up a coin from the attic. The current room is the Cubicle, and they've been moving back and forth between the Dish-Pit and Cubicle.

First, the goal is to follow the sequence: venture west, then south, east, east, north, west, south, south, west, and then pick up the coin in the attic. But the user is stuck in a loop between Dish-Pit and Cubicle. They went west from Dish-Pit to Cubicle, then west again to Dish-Pit, and so on. That's repeating the same steps without progress.

So, the next step is to break the loop. Instead of going west again, maybe they need to go north from the Cubicle. The prompt says there's an exit to the north in the Cubicle. Going north might lead them to a new area. Then, after that, they can proceed with the next steps in the original plan. The key is to avoid repeating the same actions and find a different path that leads towards the attic where the coin is.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to navigate through the rooms as per the initial instructions and pick up the coin in the attic. So far, they've moved through several rooms: Steam Room → Studio → Dish-Pit → Cubicle → Dish-Pit → Kitchenette → Cubicle → Dish-Pit again. Now they're in the Studio again, which was a previous room.

Looking at the steps they need to take: venture west, then south, east, east, north, west, south, south, west, then pick up the coin. But they've been looping between Dish-Pit and Cubicle, which suggests they're not making progress towards the attic. 

In the current room, the Studio, there are exits to east and south. The next step in the original plan after the Studio was to go south, but the user might have already done that. Wait, the initial instructions said after going west, then south, then east, then east, then north, etc. So maybe after the Studio, they need to go south again. But the user is in the Studio again, so perhaps they need to go south from here. However, the previous steps showed that going south from Studio leads to Dish-Pit again. But the user needs to get to the attic. Maybe the attic is accessible through a different path. Alternatively, maybe the coin is in the Studio, but the user hasn't checked there yet. Wait, the original task was to pick up the coin from the attic, so maybe the attic is a separate room. 

But the user is in the Studio now. The next step according to the initial plan was after going north from the Cubicle, then west to Studio. So perhaps from Studio, they need to go east again. But the user has to follow the exact steps given. The original plan was: venture west, south, east, east, north, west, south, south, west, then pick up the coin. So after the Studio, the next step would be to go east again. But the user is in the Studio, and the exits are east and south. The original plan after Studio would be to go south, but that leads back to Dish-Pit. However, maybe the user needs to go east from Studio to proceed further. Alternatively, maybe the coin is in the Studio, but the user hasn't checked. But the task says to pick up the coin from the attic, so perhaps the attic is a different room. 

Wait, the user's current position is Studio. The previous steps were moving through the rooms, but they're stuck in a loop. The key is to break the loop. Since going west and east between Dish-Pit and Cubicle isn't helping, maybe they need to go south from Studio to reach a new area. But the user has already done that. Alternatively, maybe they need to go east from Studio to reach a new room. The original plan after Studio was to go south, but maybe that's not the right path. The user needs to find the attic. Perhaps the attic is accessible through the Kitchenette or another room. But the user is in the Studio now. The next step would be to go east from Studio, which is unguarded. Let's check the exits again. In the Studio, there's an exit to the east and south. The user needs to proceed towards the attic. Maybe going east from Studio leads to the attic. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go south from Studio to reach a different area. But the user has already been there. 

The user's past actions include moving back and forth between Dish-Pit and Cubicle, which is a loop. The next step is to break that loop. Since the user is in the Studio, maybe they need to go east to proceed. The original plan after the Studio was to go south, but that leads back to Dish-Pit. However, the user needs to get to the attic. Maybe the correct path is to go east from Studio to reach a new room, then proceed further. So the next action should be go east.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Steam Room and Studio. The goal is to pick up the coin from the attic. The previous steps have them moving back and forth without progress. The key is to break the loop. Since going west and east between these rooms isn't working, maybe they need to find another path. The next step should be to go south from the Studio to reach a new area. But the user has already done that. Wait, maybe the attic is accessible through a different exit. Alternatively, maybe the coin is in the Studio, and the user needs to check there. But the task says the coin is in the attic. Hmm. The user needs to find the attic. Perhaps the correct path is to go east from the Studio to reach the Steam Room again, but that's not helping. Maybe the user needs to go south again from the Studio to the Dish-Pit and then find another exit. But the user is stuck in a loop. The answer is to go south from the Studio to break the loop and proceed further.

The answer is to go south from the Studio to break the loop and proceed further.

-= Dish-Pit =-
You arrive in a dish-pit. An usual one. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."



There is an unguarded exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.
