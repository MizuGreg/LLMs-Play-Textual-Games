Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First stop, make an effort to head west. With that done, move south. And then, head east. And then, move east. Next, make an attempt to venture east. Then, make an attempt to go to the east. Next, make an attempt to go north. And then, attempt to venture west. And then, make an attempt to move south. With that done, try to travel west. Next, retrieve the coin from the floor of the bedroom. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is in a text-based game called TextWorld, and their task is to navigate through different rooms and collect a coin. The initial instructions mention moving west, then south, east, etc., but the environment seems to be changing rooms each time.

First, the user starts in the Laundromat, goes west into a Chamber, then south into a Closet. The current room is the Closet, and the prompts suggest trying east or north. The user's previous actions were "go west", "go south", and now they're in the Closet. The next step according to the initial instructions was to go east again, but the system is prompting for different directions.

The user's goal is to retrieve the coin from the bedroom. So far, they've moved through Laundromat → Chamber → Closet. The next steps might involve moving east or north from the Closet. The challenge is to find the right path to the bedroom and collect the coin without getting stuck in a loop.

Looking at the previous responses, the user tried "go west", "go south", and now the system is suggesting east or north. The user might be in a loop if they keep moving between rooms without progress. To break the loop, they need to find a different direction or use a synonym if the same action isn't working.

The next action should be to go east from the Closet, as per the initial instructions. But the system's message says "You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south." Wait, in the Closet, the user is told to try east or north. Maybe the user needs to go north from the Closet to proceed further. Alternatively, maybe the correct path is east to get out of the Closet and continue towards the bedroom.

The user's next move should be to go east or north. Since the initial instructions said to go east after moving south, perhaps the correct path is east. But the system's prompt is a bit confusing. The user needs to follow the steps: after moving south into the Closet, the next step is to go east, then maybe north, then west, etc., to reach the bedroom and collect the coin.

So the next action should be "go east" from the Closet. If that's not working, maybe "go north" instead. But the user has to follow the initial steps as given. The key is to proceed through the required directions to reach the bedroom and pick up the coin.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text adventure game where they need to navigate through different rooms and collect a coin from the bedroom. The goal is to follow a specific sequence of movements: west, south, east, east, east, north, west, south, west, then retrieve the coin.

Looking at the current state, the user has been moving between the Closet, Canteen, and Chamber, looping between them. The previous actions were go west, south, east, north, south, east, which brings them back to the Closet. This loop suggests that the user is stuck in a cycle without making progress towards the bedroom.

The next step should be to find a way out of this loop. Since the Closet has an unguarded exit to the east and north, but going east leads back to the Canteen and then the Closet again, maybe trying a different direction is needed. The user needs to find a path that leads them towards the bedroom without looping.

The initial instructions mention moving west, south, east, east, east, north, west, south, west. After several attempts, the user is still in the Closet. The key is to break the loop by trying a different direction. Since the system is prompting to go east or north in the Closet, but going east leads back, maybe trying north again could be the way. However, the user has already tried that. Alternatively, maybe there's a different path through the Chamber or Canteen that wasn't explored yet.

Wait, in the Canteen, there's an unblocked exit to the east. Maybe going east from the Canteen is the way to go. But the user was told to try going west from the Canteen. However, the user needs to follow the initial steps as given. The next action should be to go east from the Canteen, which is the next step in the original plan. But the user is stuck in a loop, so perhaps the correct action is to go east again from the Canteen to proceed further.

The user needs to continue following the initial steps but might be stuck if they keep looping.

The next step in the original plan was to go east from the Studio. But the user needs to check if that's the correct direction. The Studio has an exit to the east and west. Since the initial instructions mention moving east multiple times, going east from the Studio might be the right move. However, the user needs to ensure they're not looping again. If going east leads to a new room, that's progress. If not, maybe trying west instead. But according to the steps, the next action should be east.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Scullery and Studio. They've been going back and forth between these two rooms. The goal is to retrieve the coin from the bedroom. So far, the user hasn't found the bedroom yet. The initial steps required moving west, south, east, etc., but they might have missed a path.

The current room is Scullery, with an exit to the north and west. The Studio has exits to east and west. The user needs to find a way to get out of this loop. Maybe they need to go north from the Scullery instead of west. The previous actions were repeatedly going west and east, which keeps them in the loop. Trying a different direction, like north, might lead them to a new room where the bedroom is located. So the next action should be to go north from the Scullery.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between Scullery and Studio. They've been going back and forth, which isn't making progress towards the bedroom where the coin is. The goal is to follow the initial steps: west, south, east, east, east, north, west, south, west, then get the coin.

Looking at the current state, the user is in Scullery again after trying to go west from Studio. The previous actions have led them in circles. The key is to break the loop. Instead of repeating west and east, they need to find another exit. In the Scullery, there's an exit to the north. Maybe going north from Scullery will lead them to a room that's not part of the loop. The Studio and Scullery are connected via west/east, but north from Scullery might lead to a different area. So the next action should be go north to escape the loop and proceed towards the bedroom.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.
