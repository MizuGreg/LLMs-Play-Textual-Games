THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Laundromat and Chamber. The goal was to move west, then south, east, east, and recover a coin. But they keep going back and forth between the rooms.

First, I need to restate the goal. The main objective is to navigate through the rooms as instructed: west, south, east, east, then get the coin. But so far, the user has only been moving west and east repeatedly, which isn't progressing toward the coin.

Looking at the past actions, the user has been going west and east alternately, which might be causing the loop. The next step after moving east should be south, but they might not be doing that. Wait, in the initial instructions, after moving east twice, they need to go south. But the current state shows they're still in the Chamber, which has an exit to the south. Maybe the user hasn't tried going south yet.

The problem is that the user is stuck in a loop between the two rooms. The key is to break the loop by trying the next step, which is going south from the Chamber. Since the previous actions were just moving east and west, changing direction to south would make progress. So the next action should be to go south.

First, the goal steps: Start by going west, then south, then east twice. But the user has been oscillating between the two rooms without going south. The next step after moving east should be south, but they keep going back.

Second, past actions: They've been moving west and east repeatedly, not taking the south exit. So the next step should be to go south from the Chamber.

Third, the loop is because they're not trying south. The key is to break the loop by trying the south exit instead of continuing to move east and west. The command should be to go south.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Laundromat and Chamber. The goal was to move west, then south, east, east, and recover the coin. But they've only been moving west and east, which isn't progressing.

First, the goal steps: Start by going west, then south, then east twice. But the user has been oscillating between the two rooms without going south. The next step after moving east should be south, but they keep going back.

Second, past actions: They've been moving west and east repeatedly, not taking the south exit. So the next step should be to go south from the Chamber.

Third, the loop is because they're not trying south. The key is to break the loop by trying the south exit instead of continuing to move east and west. The command should be to go south.

You've just walked into a laundromat. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.



There is an unblocked exit to the west.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Laundromat and Chamber. The goal was to move west, then south, east, east, and recover the coin. But they've only been moving west and east, which isn't progressing.

First, the goal steps: Start by going west, then south, then east twice. But the user has been oscillating between the two rooms without going south. The next step after moving east should be south, but they keep going back.

Second, past actions: They've been moving west and east repeatedly, not taking the south exit. So the next step should be to go south from the Chamber.

Third, the loop is because they're not trying south. The key is to break the loop by trying the south exit instead of continuing to move east and west. The command should be to go south.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Laundromat and Chamber. The goal was to move west, then south, east, east, and recover the coin. But they've only been moving west and east, which isn't progressing.

First, the goal steps: Start by going west, then south, then east twice. But the user has been oscillating between the two rooms without going south. The next step after moving east should be south, but they keep going back.
