Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First stop, try to venture east. Then, venture south. After that, try to go to the south. Once you succeed at that, try to go west. If you can finish that, try to move north. That done, make an effort to take a trip east. After that, try to take a trip south. Okay, and then, try to travel south. Then, pick-up the coin from the floor of the closet. Got that? Good!

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Attic and Steam Room. The goal was to navigate through specific directions and pick up the coin. But they keep going back and forth between north and south.

First, I need to recall the original instructions: go east, south, west, north, east, south, then pick up the coin in the closet. But the current path is looping between Attic and Steam Room. Maybe the coin is in the Steam Room or somewhere else.

Wait, the user tried going south from the Steam Room and ended up back in the Attic. Then going north again loops back. The problem is that the directions are leading them in a cycle. They need to find a different path. Maybe there's an unguarded exit to the south in the Steam Room. The prompt mentioned an unguarded exit to the south in the Steam Room. So instead of going north again, they should go south from the Steam Room to exit. That would break the loop. Then they can proceed to the next steps. The next action should be going south from the Steam Room.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to navigate through specific directions and pick up the coin in the closet. They've been moving between the Attic and Steam Room, which is causing a loop. The current room is the Cubicle, and they've been going north and south between the Basement and Cubicle.

First, the goal steps are: go east, south, west, north, east, south, then pick up the coin. So far, they've done some of these steps, but they're stuck in a loop between the Basement and Cubicle. The next step should be to find the coin, but they need to get to the closet. 

The user is in the Cubicle, and the exit to the south is unguarded. Maybe the coin is in the Closet, which is connected to the Cubicle. The previous actions of going north and south are not helping. Instead of repeating the same actions, they should look for another exit. The Cubicle has an exit to the south, so going south from here would take them to the Basement again. But they need to find the Closet. Maybe the Closet is in the Basement or connected through another exit. 

Wait, the user mentioned the Closet in the initial instructions. The coin is in the Closet. So they need to find the Closet. The current path is looping between Basement and Cubicle. Maybe the Closet is in the Cubicle or connected via another direction. The Cubicle has an exit to the north (Basement) and south (unguarded). Maybe the Closet is in the Cubicle, and the user needs to check there. But the user hasn't looked inside the Cubicle yet. 

Alternatively, maybe the Closet is in the Basement. The user needs to explore the Basement further. The Basement has an exit to the west. So going west from the Basement might lead to the Closet. The user should try that instead of looping between north and south. So the next action should be going west from the Basement to reach the Closet and pick up the coin.
