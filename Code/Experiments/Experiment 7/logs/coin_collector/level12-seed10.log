I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is how to play! First off, try to venture east. Then, venture south. After that, try to go to the south. Once you succeed at that, try to go west. If you can finish that, try to move north. That done, make an effort to take a trip east. After that, try to take a trip south. Okay, and then, try to travel south. Then, travel south. And then, venture south. After that, attempt to go east. Then, recover the coin from the floor of the bedchamber. That's it!

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Spare Room and the Attic. They keep going east and west, but it's not making progress. The goal was to recover the coin from the bedchamber, but they haven't found it yet.

First, I need to recall the original instructions. The user was supposed to move in specific directions: east, south, west, north, etc., and then find the coin. But they're just moving back and forth between rooms without exploring properly.

Looking at the current state, every time they go east, they end up in the Attic, and going west brings them back to the Spare Room. So they're stuck in a loop. The problem is that they're not exploring other directions or looking for items. The coin is in the bedchamber, which might be south from the Attic. But they need to get there without just moving back and forth.

The next step should be to go south from the Attic to reach the bedchamber. But the user has been going west instead. So maybe they need to try going south instead of west. That would break the loop and lead them to the bedchamber where the coin is. So the correct action is to go south from the Attic.

Ah, the closet. This is some kind of closet, really great typical vibes in this place, a wonderful typical atmosphere. And now, well, you're in it. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is stuck in a loop between the Closet and Basement, moving back and forth. The goal is to recover the coin from the bedchamber. So far, they've been moving north and south between these two rooms without making progress.

First step: The main goal is to find the coin in the bedchamber. The user needs to navigate to the bedchamber, which is likely in a different part of the house.

Second step: The user has been repeatedly going between Closet and Basement, which isn't helping. They need to find another path. Maybe there's a different exit or a room they haven't explored yet.

Third step: Since the current actions (north/south) are looping, they need to try a different direction. The previous attempts to go west from the Basement might be the key. The user should try going west instead of north to break the loop and explore new areas.

Final action: The correct next step is to go west from the Basement to find the bedchamber and retrieve the coin.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in the game. The main goal is to recover the coin from the bedchamber. So far, they've been moving between the Closet, Basement, and Kitchenette, but they're stuck in a loop.

First, I need to recall the steps. The user was supposed to move in specific directions: east, south, west, north, etc., and then find the coin. But they're just moving back and forth without exploring properly.

Looking at the current state, every time they go south from the Closet, they end up in the Basement, and going north brings them back. Then, they tried going west from the Basement to the Kitchenette, but that didn't help. Now they're back in the Closet again.

The problem is that they're not exploring other directions or looking for items. The coin is in the bedchamber, which might be south from the Attic. But they need to get there without just moving back and forth.

The next step should be to go south from the Closet to reach the bedchamber. But the user has been going north instead. So maybe they need to try going south instead of north. That would break the loop and lead them to the bedchamber where the coin is. So the correct action is to go south from the Closet.

You arrive in a basement. A normal one.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Closet, Basement, and Kitchenette. They keep moving north and south between these rooms without making progress. The goal is to find the coin in the bedchamber.

First, I need to recall the steps. The user was supposed to navigate through different rooms, possibly moving east, south, west, north, and eventually reach the bedchamber. But they're stuck in a cycle.

Looking at their past actions, they've been going back and forth between Closet and Basement, then to Kitchenette and back. The key is to break this loop. The previous attempts to go west from the Basement led them to the Kitchenette, but that didn't help. Maybe they need to try a different direction from the Kitchenette, like east again.

The next step should be to go east from the Kitchenette to find the bedchamber. Since they've been repeating north and south without progress, changing direction might help. So the correct action is to go east.

Ah, the closet. This is some kind of closet, really great typical vibes in this place, a wonderful typical atmosphere. And now, well, you're in it. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.



There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.
