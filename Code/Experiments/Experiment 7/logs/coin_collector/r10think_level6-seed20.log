It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! First of all, you could, like, head north. With that accomplished, go to the north. Then, make an effort to go north. Then, travel east. And then, make an effort to move north. Once you succeed at that, recover the coin from the floor of the playroom. That's it!

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Salon and Study. The goal is to recover the coin from the playroom. The instructions mention going north, then south, repeating, but it's not making progress.

First, the goal is to get the coin from the playroom. The user has been moving back and forth between Salon and Study, which isn't helping. The next step should be to find the playroom. Since the exit to the north is unblocked in the Salon, maybe that's the way. But the user keeps going south, which brings them back. 

Wait, the initial directions said to go north, then north again, then east, then north. But the user is stuck in a loop. Maybe the problem is that the user is repeatedly going south and north, which is not moving forward. The key is to find the playroom. Maybe the playroom is in the Study? Or perhaps the exit to the north from the Salon leads to the playroom. But the user needs to get there without looping.

The user needs to break the loop. Instead of going south, maybe there's another direction. But the current description only mentions an exit to the north in the Salon and Study. Maybe the playroom is in the Study, and the coin is there. But the user hasn't checked the Study's contents. Wait, the initial instruction said to recover the coin from the floor of the playroom. So the playroom must be a room where the coin is on the floor. 

But the user is stuck between Salon and Study. Maybe the playroom is in the Study. The user needs to check the Study for the coin. However, the Study's description doesn't mention a coin. The user might need to explore further. Alternatively, maybe the playroom is accessible from the Study's north exit. But the user is stuck in a loop, so they need to find a different action. Maybe the user should try moving east instead of south when in the Study. But the Study's description says there's an exit to the north and suggests going south. 

Wait, the initial instructions said to go north, then north again, then east, then north. But the user is stuck in a loop. Maybe the correct path is to go north from the Salon to the Study, then east, then north to reach the playroom. But the user is repeatedly going south, which is causing the loop. So the next step is to stop going south and try east instead. But the Study's description doesn't mention east. Hmm. Maybe the user needs to find another way. Alternatively, the playroom is in the Study, and the coin is there. The user should check the Study's items. But the current description doesn't mention any items. 

Wait, the user's goal is to recover the coin from the playroom's floor. So the playroom must be a room where the coin is on the floor. The user needs to reach that room. The current loop suggests that the exit to the north from the Salon is leading back to the Study, which is causing the loop. Maybe the playroom is in the Study, and the user needs to look for the coin there. But the Study's description doesn't mention a coin. 

Alternatively, maybe the user should try moving east when in the Study. But the Study's description only mentions an exit to the north and suggests going south. So perhaps the correct action is to go east, but the user hasn't tried that yet. However, the user has been going south repeatedly. The key is to break the loop by trying a different direction. So the next action should be to go east in the Study, even if it's not mentioned, as per the initial instructions.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Salon and Study. The goal is to recover the coin from the playroom. The user has been moving north and south repeatedly, which isn't helping. 

First, the goal is to get to the playroom and pick up the coin. The user has been going back and forth between Salon and Study, which suggests they're not making progress. The next step should be to find the playroom, but they're stuck in a loop.

Looking at the previous actions, the user kept going south from the Study, which brings them back to the Salon, and then north again. This loop isn't working. The key is to break the loop by trying a different direction. Maybe there's an east exit they haven't tried yet. But the Study's description only mentions a north exit. Wait, the initial instructions said to go east after some north steps. Maybe the user needs to try east when in the Study, even if it's not listed, to proceed towards the playroom. The user needs to try a different action to break the loop.

-= Chamber =-
You find yourself in a chamber. A standard kind of place.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

-= Sauna =-
Well I'll be, you are in the place we're calling the sauna.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Garage =-
Well, here we are in the garage. You start to take note of what's in the room.



There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

<think>
Okay, the user has finally reached the Garage. The goal is to recover the coin from the playroom. The user has been moving through various rooms, breaking the loop by going east from the Sauna. Now, in the Garage, there are exits to the north and west. The next step is to check if the coin is here or find the playroom. Since the Garage is a new room, maybe the coin is here. The user should look around for the coin. But the instruction says to go north or west. Wait, the initial goal was to get to the playroom. Maybe the playroom is in the Garage. The user needs to check the floor for the coin. But the current description doesn't mention it. The next action is to look for the coin here. But the command should be a direction. Since the user is in the Garage, maybe going north or west leads to the playroom. The user should try going north first.

-= Playroom =-
I never took you for the sort of person who would show up in a playroom, but I guess I was wrong. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."



There is an unblocked exit to the south.

There is a coin on the floor.
