FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and retrieve a coin. The goal is to follow the steps given: first go east, then east again, then north, then north again, and finally get the coin from the parlor.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Workshop again (step 5). They've already gone east from the Office to the Cellar, then east again to the Workshop. Then they went north to the Canteen, south back to the Workshop. So they're back in the Workshop. The next step according to the initial instructions was to go north again from the Canteen, but that led back to the Workshop. Now they need to find a way forward.

The problem here is that going north from the Workshop is unblocked, but maybe that's not the right path. Alternatively, the west exit is unguarded. Wait, the initial plan was to go north from the Canteen, but that led back. Maybe the correct path is to go west from the Workshop to the Canteen again, then north to the Office, then east to the Cellar, then maybe find the coin? But the coin is in the parlor. Wait, the original instructions said to retrieve the coin from the floor of the parlor. So maybe after getting to the Office, go east to the Cellar, then somewhere else?

Wait, the user is in the Workshop again. The previous steps were: Office -> Cellar -> Workshop -> Canteen -> Workshop. So they need to go north from the Workshop again? But that's where they came from. Alternatively, maybe the correct path is to go west from the Workshop to the Canteen, then north to the Office, then east to the Cellar, then maybe east again to the parlor? But the parlor isn't mentioned yet. Wait, the initial steps said to go east, then east, then north, then north. So maybe after the Workshop, go north to the Canteen, then south back to Workshop, then east to Cellar, then north to Office, then east to Cellar again? Hmm, this is confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the user is stuck in a loop between Workshop and Canteen. The next step should be to go west from the Workshop to the Canteen again, then north to the Office, then east to the Cellar, then east again to the parlor where the coin is. But the user needs to find the coin in the parlor. So the correct path is to go north from the Canteen to the Office, then east to Cellar, then east again to the parlor. But the user is in the Workshop now. So from Workshop, go west to Canteen, then north to Office, then east to Cellar, then east to parlor. Then retrieve the coin.

But the user's last action was going south from the Canteen back to Workshop. Now they are in Workshop again. The next step should be to go west to Canteen, then north to Office, then east to Cellar, then east to parlor. But the user needs to make sure they don't loop. So the next action is to go west from Workshop to Canteen. But the user is in Workshop, so the command would be "go west".

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text adventure game where they need to navigate through different rooms to retrieve a coin. The initial instructions were to go east, then east again, then north, then north again, and finally get the coin from the parlor.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Workshop again (step 7). They've been moving between the Workshop, Canteen, and Cellar, creating a loop. The previous actions didn't lead them closer to the parlor where the coin is. The goal is to break this loop and proceed towards the parlor.

The next step should be to find a way out of the Workshop that wasn't previously tried. The Workshop has an unblocked exit to the north and an unguarded exit to the west. Since going west led back to the Cellar, maybe going north from the Workshop is the way to go. But the user has already tried that before. Wait, the user is in the Workshop again, so maybe they need to go north to the Canteen again, then proceed further. But the initial plan was to go north from the Canteen to the Office. So perhaps the correct path is to go north from the Workshop to the Canteen, then north again to the Office, then east to the Cellar, and finally east to the parlor where the coin is. But the user is stuck in a loop between Workshop and Canteen. Therefore, the next action should be to go north from the Workshop to the Canteen, then proceed north again to the Office. But since the user is in the Workshop, the immediate next command is "go north".

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Workshop and Canteen. They've been going back and forth, which isn't helping them progress towards the parlor where the coin is. The goal is to retrieve the coin from the parlor, so they need to find a way to get there.

Looking at the current position, the user is in the Workshop again. The previous steps involved going east, then east again, then north, then north again, but that led them back. The key is to break the loop. The Workshop has an exit to the north (Canteen) and west (Cellar). Since going north leads back to the Canteen, which then leads back to the Workshop, maybe they need to try a different direction. Wait, the Canteen has an exit to the east, which is unguarded. Maybe from the Canteen, going east would take them to the Office, then east again to the Cellar, and then finally to the parlor. But the user is in the Workshop, so the next step should be to go north to the Canteen again, then east to the Office. But the user has already tried that. Alternatively, maybe they need to go west from the Workshop to the Cellar, then east to the Office, then east again to the parlor. But the user is in the Workshop, so the immediate action is to go north to the Canteen. However, that's what they've been doing. Maybe they need to use a synonym for "go north" like "move north" or "head north", but the game might not recognize it. Alternatively, maybe the correct action is to go west from the Workshop to the Cellar, then east to the Office, then east again to the parlor. But the user is in the Workshop, so the next command should be "go west" to break the loop.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Office and the Cellar. They keep going east and west between these two rooms without making progress. The goal is to retrieve the coin from the parlor, but they haven't reached it yet.

Looking at the current state, every time they try to go east from the Office, it takes them back to the Cellar, and going west from the Cellar brings them back to the Office. This is a loop, so they need to find another way out. The problem is that the previous actions (going east and west) aren't leading them closer to the parlor. 

The user needs to break this loop. Maybe they need to find a different path that wasn't previously tried. But according to the game's environment, the only exits from the Office are east, and from the Cellar are east and west. Wait, maybe there's another exit in another room that hasn't been explored yet. But based on the previous steps, the user has only been moving between these two rooms.

Alternatively, maybe the parlor is connected to one of these rooms. The initial instructions mentioned retrieving the coin from the parlor, so perhaps the user needs to reach the parlor through a different route. But since they're stuck in a loop, they need to find a way out of the current cycle. 

The next step should be to try a different action. Since the user has been repeating "go east" and "go west", maybe using a synonym or a different command could help. However, the game might not recognize synonyms. The user needs to find an unblocked exit that leads them towards the parlor. But based on the current room descriptions, the only exits are the ones already tried. 

Wait, maybe the user needs to go north from the Office or Cellar. But the Office's description says to try going east, and the Cellar's description mentions going west. Perhaps there's a north exit that's unblocked. But in the previous steps, the user hasn't tried that. However, the game's current state doesn't mention a north exit. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go north from the Workshop, but they're currently in the Cellar. This is confusing. The key is to break the loop by finding a new path. Since the user is in the Cellar, maybe going west is the unguarded entrance, but that leads back to the Office. The only way out is east, which loops back. 

The user must have missed a step earlier. Maybe the parlor is connected to the Workshop or Canteen. But the user hasn't explored those rooms yet. However, the current path is stuck. The next action should be to try going north from the Office, even though the description says to go east. Maybe that's the key to breaking the loop.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.
