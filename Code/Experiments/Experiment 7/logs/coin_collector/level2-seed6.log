Welcome to TextWorld! Here is how to play! First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to make an attempt to take a trip south. With that done, pick up the coin from the floor of the basement. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Sauna =-
You're now in a sauna.



There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

-= Basement =-
You've just sauntered into a basement. You begin looking for stuff.



There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

There is a coin on the floor.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and collect a coin to win. The current scenario is the basement, where they've already gone south from the sauna. The goal is to pick up the coin on the floor and then exit through the north to win.

First, the goal is to take a trip south (already done), pick up the coin (not yet done), and then exit north. The next step should be to pick up the coin. But the user's last action was going south, which is already completed. Now, in the basement, the coin is on the floor. So the next logical step is to pick up the coin. However, the user might have already done that, but according to the current prompt, the coin is still on the floor. So the correct action here is to pick up the coin. But the user's previous action was going south, which is part of the first step. Now, the next step is to pick up the coin. The user needs to check if they're in a loop. Since they've already exited the sauna and entered the basement, and the coin is present, there's no loop. So the next action is to pick up the coin.
