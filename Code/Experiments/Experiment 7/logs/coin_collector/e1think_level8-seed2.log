Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. Your first objective is to try to venture north. After that, head east. That done, go to the east. Next, attempt to travel north. And then, travel west. That done, head south. With that accomplished, make an effort to head west. After that, pick-up the coin from the floor of the steam room. And once you"ve done that, you win!

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text-based game where they need to follow specific directions to reach the coin and win. The current location is the Kitchen, and the previous action was going north from the Studio to the Kitchen.

The goal is to venture north, then east, then east again, then north, west, south, west again, pick up the coin, and win. So far, the user has done the first step (north from Studio to Kitchen). The next steps according to the instructions are to go east from the Kitchen. But the user is told that in the Kitchen, there's an exit to the east, but they're advised to try south instead. Wait, the user's next step should be to go east as per the original plan. But the prompt says "You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south." Maybe there's a loop here. Let me check the steps again.

Original plan: After going north to Kitchen, next is to head east. But the Kitchen's east exit is unguarded, but the prompt suggests trying south. However, the user's objective is to go east from Kitchen. Maybe the user is stuck because going east is possible but the game is giving a hint to go south. Wait, maybe the user is in a loop between Kitchen and another room. Let me think: the initial steps were Studio -> Kitchen. Then, from Kitchen, the user needs to go east. But the game's message says "You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south." Maybe the user is supposed to go south instead of east? But according to the original plan, after Kitchen, the next step is east. But the game's message is confusing. Maybe the user is in a loop between Kitchen and another room. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east, but the game's message is just a hint. The user's next action should be to go east as per the original plan. But the game's message says to try south. Wait, the user's original instructions say after going north to Kitchen, head east. So the next step is east. But the game's message says "You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south." Maybe the user is in a loop, so they need to find another way. Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go east, and the message is just a suggestion. The user's next action should be go east. But the user is in the Kitchen, and the exit to the east is unguarded. So the correct next step is to go east. But the game's message says to try south. Hmm. Maybe the user is in a loop between Kitchen and another room. Let me check the original plan again. The user's steps are: north (Studio to Kitchen), east (Kitchen to next room), then east again, then north, west, south, west, pick up coin. So after Kitchen, the next step is east. But the game's message says to try south. Maybe the user is in a loop, so they need to go east instead of south. Therefore, the next action is go east.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in a text-based game. The goal is to follow a specific sequence of directions and pick up a coin in the steam room.

First, the initial steps were going north from the studio to the kitchen, then east to the bedchamber. Now, the current room is the bedchamber. The user needs to continue following the instructions: after the bedchamber, the next step is to go north again, then west, then south, then west again, and finally pick up the coin.

Wait, the user's previous actions were: go north (studio to kitchen), then east (kitchen to bedchamber). The next step according to the original plan was to go north from the bedchamber. But the bedchamber's exits are east and west. So going north from here might not be possible. Hmm, maybe there's a mistake in the path. Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go west from the bedchamber instead of north. But the original instructions said after the bedchamber, go north. But the bedchamber's exits are east and west. So perhaps the user is in a loop here. 

Wait, the original plan was: venture north (studio to kitchen), then east (kitchen to bedchamber), then attempt to travel north (from bedchamber, but that's not possible). So maybe the user is stuck here. The problem is that the bedchamber's exits are east and west, not north. So the next step should be to go west from the bedchamber, which would take them back to the kitchen. But the original plan says after bedchamber, go north. That's conflicting. So maybe the user is in a loop between bedchamber and kitchen. 

But the user's next action should be to go north from the bedchamber, but that's not possible. So perhaps the user needs to find another way. Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go west from the bedchamber, then proceed to the kitchen again, then go north again. But the original plan says after bedchamber, go north. So maybe the user is stuck here. 

In this case, the user is in the bedchamber, and the next step according to the plan is to go north, but that's not possible. Therefore, the user needs to find an alternative action. The exits are east and west. So maybe the user should go west instead of north. But the original plan says to go north. However, since going north isn't possible, the user has to find another way. So the next action should be to go west, which would take them back to the kitchen. Then, from the kitchen, maybe they can go south to the studio again, and then proceed further. 

But the original plan says after bedchamber, go north. So perhaps the user is in a loop. Therefore, the user needs to adjust their actions. The correct next step would be to go west from the bedchamber, then proceed to the kitchen, then go south to the studio, then go north again. But the user needs to follow the original steps. 

Wait, the original instructions were: venture north (studio to kitchen), then east (kitchen to bedchamber), then attempt to travel north (from bedchamber, which is not possible), then travel west (from bedchamber, which is possible). So maybe the user is supposed to go west from the bedchamber, then proceed to the kitchen, then go south to the studio, then go north again. But the user is in the bedchamber now. So the next action should be to go west, even though the original plan says go north. Because going north isn't possible. So the user has to adjust their steps. 

Therefore, the next action is to go west from the bedchamber. That would take them back to the kitchen. Then, from the kitchen, go south to the studio, then go north again. But the user is in the bedchamber now, so the next step is to go west.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in a text-based game. The goal is to follow a specific sequence of directions: north, east, north, west, south, west, then pick up the coin in the steam room.

So far, the user has gone north from the studio to the kitchen, then east to the bedchamber, then west back to the kitchen. Now they're in the kitchen again, which is step 4. The next steps according to the original instructions are: after going south, then west, then pick up the coin.

Wait, the current room is the kitchen. The previous actions were: go north (studio -> kitchen), then east (kitchen -> bedchamber), then west (bedchamber -> kitchen). Now, the user is back in the kitchen. The next step in the original plan was to go south from the kitchen. But the prompt says after going south, then west, then pick up the coin.

But in the current state, the user is in the kitchen again. The next action should be to go south, as per the original plan. However, the user might be in a loop if they keep going back and forth. But according to the steps, after the initial north, east, north, west, south, west, then the coin. So in the kitchen, after going south, they would move to the next room. Then west from there, then pick up the coin.

But the user is in the kitchen again. The previous action was west from the bedchamber. Now, the next step is to go south from the kitchen. The user needs to go south, then west, then find the coin. So the next command should be 'go south' to proceed.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text adventure game, and their goal is to follow a specific path to win. The instructions say they need to go north, then east, then north again, west, south, west again, pick up the coin in the steam room, and then win.

Looking at the current state, the user is back in the Studio after moving south. Let me recap the steps they've taken so far. 

First, they started in the Studio, went north to the Kitchen. Then from the Kitchen, they went east to the Bedchamber, then west back to the Kitchen. From there, they went south back to the Studio. So far, they've done: north, east, west, south. The next steps in the original plan were to go north again, then west, then south, then west again, then pick up the coin.

But wait, the user is now in the Studio again. The next step according to the original plan was to go north again. But the Studio's exit is north, which they already went through. However, maybe there's another way. But according to the game's current state, the Studio has an exit to the north, which is unblocked. So perhaps they need to go north again from here. But if they've already been there, maybe they need to check if there's another path or if they need to move in a different direction.

But the user's next action should be to go north again, as per the original plan. However, the game might have a loop here. The user has cycled through Studio -> Kitchen -> Bedchamber -> Kitchen -> Studio. So maybe they need to find a different direction. But the Studio only has a north exit. Wait, the original plan said after going south, they need to go west. But in the Studio, the only exit is north. So perhaps they need to go north again, but that's the same as before. Maybe there's a mistake in the steps, or perhaps the coin is in the Studio. But the original plan says to pick up the coin in the steam room. So maybe the steam room is a different location.

Wait, the user hasn't picked up the coin yet. The goal is to go through the specified directions and then pick up the coin. So maybe after getting back to the Studio, they need to go north again, then east, then north, then west, then south, then west again, and then find the coin. But the current position is Studio, so next step is north again. But the user might be stuck in a loop. However, the game's description says that the Studio's north exit is unblocked. So maybe they need to proceed north again. But the user is at Studio, so going north would take them back to the Kitchen. But they've already been there. However, maybe the path is correct, and they just need to continue following the steps. So the next action is to go north again.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in a text-based game. The goal is to follow a specific path: venture north, then east, then north again, west, south, west again, pick up the coin in the steam room, and win.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Kitchen again, which has been a recurring place. The previous steps have led them in a loop between the Studio, Kitchen, Bedchamber, and back to the Kitchen. The challenge is to break this loop and proceed towards the steam room to pick up the coin.

The user's past actions have been: go north (to Studio), then east (to Bedchamber), west (back to Kitchen), south (back to Studio), north (back to Kitchen). So they're stuck in a loop between Studio and Kitchen. The next step should be to find a way out of this loop. The Kitchen has an exit to the east, but going east from the Kitchen leads back to the Bedchamber, which then leads back to the Kitchen. Wait, maybe the user needs to go south from the Kitchen again, but that leads back to the Studio. Hmm.

Wait, the original instructions said after going south, then west, then north, etc. Maybe the user needs to find the steam room. The steam room is mentioned as the place where the coin is. So perhaps the path requires moving east from the Kitchen again, but the Bedchamber's exit to the east is unblocked. Wait, the Bedchamber has an exit to the east and west. Maybe from the Bedchamber, going east leads to another room, perhaps the steam room? But the user hasn't been there yet.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west from the Kitchen again, but that leads back to the Studio. Wait, the user is in the Kitchen again, and the previous steps have them looping. The key is to find the correct path to the steam room. The user needs to go east from the Kitchen, then maybe north or south to reach the steam room. But the problem is that the current path is leading them in circles.

Wait, the original plan was: north, east, north, west, south, west, then steam room. But the user is stuck in a loop. Maybe the correct path is to go east from the Kitchen to the Bedchamber, then east again to another room, then proceed. But the Bedchamber's east exit is unblocked. Let me check the previous steps again.

In the Bedchamber, the user can go east or west. If they go east from the Bedchamber, maybe that's the way to the steam room. But the user hasn't tried that yet. So the next step should be to go east from the Bedchamber. But the user is currently in the Kitchen. So from the Kitchen, go east to Bedchamber, then east again. But the user's last action was go south from the Kitchen, leading back to Studio. Then go north again to Kitchen. So the user is stuck in a loop between Studio and Kitchen.

Therefore, the next action should be to go east from the Kitchen to the Bedchamber, then east again to proceed towards the steam room. But the user is in the Kitchen again, so the next command should be go east.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in a text-based game. The goal is to follow a specific sequence of directions: north, east, north, west, south, west, then pick up the coin in the steam room.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Bedchamber. The previous steps have them moving north, east, north, west, south, east, and now they're back in the Bedchamber again. The next step according to the original plan was to go west again, but that might be leading them in a loop.

Wait, the user's path has them cycling between the Kitchen and Bedchamber. The original instructions said after going west (step 5), they should go south to the Studio (step 6), then north again (step 7), east (step 8), and so on. But in the current state, they're back in the Bedchamber after moving east again. So maybe they need to find a different path to reach the steam room without looping.

The key is to avoid repeating the same actions. Since moving east and west is causing a loop, perhaps they need to find another exit or look for the coin directly. But the game mentions the coin is in the steam room, which hasn't been visited yet. So the user needs to navigate to the steam room, which might require a different path.

Alternatively, maybe the correct sequence is to go north from the Studio, then east to the Kitchen, then south to the Studio again, but that doesn't seem to progress. Wait, the original plan was after going west (step 5), go south (step 6), then north (step 7), east (step 8), etc. But the user is stuck in a loop between Kitchen and Bedchamber. So the next step should be to break the loop by trying a different direction, like south from the Bedchamber, but the Bedchamber has an exit to the west and east. Maybe the user needs to go west from the Bedchamber to the Kitchen again, but that's already been done.

Alternatively, perhaps the user needs to look for the coin in the current room. The Bedchamber might have the coin, but the original instruction says to pick it up from the steam room. So maybe the user needs to find the steam room through another path. But the current rooms are Studio, Kitchen, Bedchamber. The steam room hasn't been visited yet. So the user needs to find a way to get to the steam room.

Wait, the initial steps were: go north (Studio), east (Kitchen), north (Bedchamber), west (Kitchen again?), south (Studio again?), west (Kitchen?), etc. It seems like the user is stuck in a loop between Kitchen and Bedchamber. The next step should be to find a different path. Maybe the user needs to go south from the Bedchamber, but the Bedchamber's exits are east and west. So perhaps the user needs to go east again, but that's already been done.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to look for the coin in the current room. The Bedchamber has a placard, but the coin is in the steam room. So the user needs to find the steam room. Maybe the steam room is accessible from the Kitchen or Studio. But the user hasn't explored those areas yet. The original plan was to go west from the Studio (step 5), but that led to the Kitchen again.

This is getting complicated. The user needs to avoid the loop and find the steam room. The next action should be to go south from the Bedchamber, but the Bedchamber doesn't have a south exit. The exits are east and west. So maybe the user needs to go east again, but that's already been done. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west from the Bedchamber to the Kitchen, then south to the Studio, then east to the Kitchen again, but that's not helping.

Wait, the original instructions said after going west (step 5), go south (step 6). But in the current state, the user is in the Bedchamber again. So maybe the next step is to go south from the Bedchamber, but there's no south exit. Therefore, the user needs to find another way. Maybe the user needs to go east from the Bedchamber to the Kitchen, then south to the Studio, then east to the Kitchen again, but that's not progressing. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to look for the coin in the current room. The Bedchamber might have the coin, but the instruction says it's in the steam room. So the user needs to find the steam room. The steam room is probably in a different part of the map. The user needs to find a way to get there without looping. Maybe the correct path is to go north from the Studio, then east to the Kitchen, then south to the Studio again, but that's not helpful.

I think the user is stuck in a loop between the Kitchen and Bedchamber. The next step should be to try a different direction, but the exits are only east and west. So maybe the user needs to go east again, but that's already been done. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go south from the Bedchamber, but there's no exit. Therefore, the user needs to find another way. Maybe the answer is to go south from the Kitchen, but the Kitchen has an exit to the east and south. Wait, in the Kitchen, the user is told to try going south. So from the Kitchen, going south would take them back to the Studio. Then from the Studio, going north again. But that's the same loop.

This is confusing. The user needs to break the loop. The next action should be to go south from the Bedchamber, but there's no exit. So perhaps the user needs to go east again, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to look for the coin in the current room. The Bedchamber might have the coin, but the instruction says it's in the steam room. So the user needs to find the steam room.

Wait, maybe the steam room is accessible from the Kitchen. The user needs to go east from the Kitchen to the Bedchamber, then west back to the Kitchen, then south to the Studio, then east to the Kitchen again. But that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go south from the Kitchen to the Studio, then east to the Kitchen again. It's a loop.

The user's next action should be to go south from the Bedchamber, but there's no exit. Therefore, the user needs to try a different action. Maybe the user needs to go west from the Bedchamber to the Kitchen, then south to the Studio, then east to the Kitchen again. But that's the same loop. The user is stuck.

The correct next step is to go south from the Kitchen, but the user is in the Bedchamber. So the user needs to go west from the Bedchamber to the Kitchen, then south to the Studio. But that's already been done. The user needs to find the steam room. Maybe the steam room is in the Studio. But the instruction says to pick up the coin from the steam room. So the user needs to go to the steam room.

I think the user is stuck in a loop and needs to find a different path. The next action should be to go south from the Kitchen, but the user is in the Bedchamber. Therefore, the user needs to go west to the Kitchen, then south to the Studio, then east to the Kitchen again. But that's not helping. The user needs to find the steam room. Maybe the steam room is in the Studio. The user needs to go to the steam room from the Studio. But the user hasn't explored that yet.

Wait, the original plan was to go north, east, north, west, south, west, then pick up the coin. The user has done north (Studio), east (Kitchen), north (Bedchamber), west (Kitchen), south (Studio), west (Kitchen), and now back in the Bedchamber. The next step is to go south from the Bedchamber, but there's no exit. So the user needs to go east again to the Kitchen, then south to the Studio, then east to the Kitchen again. It's a loop.

The user needs to break the loop. The next action should be to go south from the Kitchen, but the user is in the Bedchamber. So the user needs to go west to the Kitchen, then south to the Studio. Then from the Studio, go north again. But that's the same loop. The user is stuck.

The correct next action is to go south from the Kitchen, but the user is in the Bedchamber. So the user needs to go west to the Kitchen, then south to the Studio.

But the user hasn't explored that yet. The user needs to go to the steam room, which is probably in the Studio. So the next step is to go to the steam room and pick up the coin. But the user hasn't reached that yet.

In the current state, the user is in the Bedchamber. The next step should be to go west to the Kitchen, then south to the Studio. From the Studio, go north again. But that's the same loop.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in a text-based game. The goal is to follow a specific path: venture north, then east, then north again, west, south, west again, pick up the coin in the steam room, and win.

Looking at the current situation, the user is in the Bedchamber. They tried to go south, but it's blocked. So, they need to find another way out. The Bedchamber has an exit to the east and west. The previous steps had them moving back and forth between the Studio, Kitchen, and Bedchamber. 

The user might be stuck in a loop because they keep going back and forth. The next step should be to try a different direction. Since south is blocked, maybe they should go east again. But wait, the goal after the initial steps is to go east, then north, then west, south, west, and then get the coin. 

Wait, the current position is Bedchamber. The exits are east and west. The user tried south, which is blocked. So, maybe they need to go west again. But earlier, going west from Bedchamber led back to the Kitchen. Then from Kitchen, going south leads back to Studio. Then north again to Bedchamber. So that's a loop.

To break the loop, maybe instead of going west, they should go east again. But the goal after the initial steps is to go east, then north, then west, etc. So perhaps the user needs to find the steam room. The coin is in the steam room. But how to get there?

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east from Bedchamber, then find a way to proceed. Let me check the previous steps. The user went north from Studio to Kitchen, then east to Bedchamber. Now, from Bedchamber, east is unblocked. So going east again might lead to another room. But the problem is that the user is stuck in a loop between Studio, Kitchen, Bedchamber.

Wait, the initial instructions say after going north, east, north, west, south, west, then pick up the coin. So maybe after getting to the steam room, the coin is there. But how to get there?

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west from Bedchamber again, but that leads back to Kitchen. Then south to Studio, then north again to Bedchamber. So that's a loop. The user needs to find a way out of this loop. Maybe the correct path is to go east from Bedchamber, then find a way to proceed. But the exits from Bedchamber are east and west. If east is unblocked, maybe that's the way. But the user tried going south and it's blocked. So perhaps the next step is to go east again, then find another path. But the user might be stuck in a loop here.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west from Bedchamber to Kitchen, then south to Studio, then north to Bedchamber again. That's not helpful. So perhaps the correct action is to go east from Bedchamber, then proceed further. But the user is in Bedchamber, and the exit to the east is unblocked. So maybe the next step is to go east again. But the user tried that before and ended up in a loop. However, the game might have a different path. Let me think again.

The user's goal is to go north, east, north, west, south, west, then get the coin. So after the initial steps, they need to go west from the Bedchamber. But the user tried going west and ended up in the Kitchen, then south to Studio, then north back to Bedchamber. So maybe the correct path is to go east from Bedchamber, then find a way to proceed. But the user is stuck here. The only exits are east and west. So maybe the user needs to go east again, then find a way to proceed. But the game might have a different room beyond the Bedchamber. Alternatively, maybe the steam room is connected through another path.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west from Bedchamber to Kitchen, then east to Bedchamber again. But that's looping. The user needs to find a way to get to the steam room. Maybe the steam room is in the Kitchen or Studio. But the user hasn't found the coin yet. The coin is in the steam room, which hasn't been mentioned yet. So perhaps the user needs to explore other rooms.

But according to the game's current state, the user is in Bedchamber, and the exits are east and west. The user tried going south, which is blocked. So the next step is to go east again. But that's the same as before. However, maybe the user needs to go east from Bedchamber to a new room, then proceed. But the game's description doesn't mention that. So perhaps the correct action is to go east again, even though it's part of the loop, but maybe that's necessary to reach the steam room.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west from Bedchamber to Kitchen, then south to Studio, then north to Bedchamber again. But that's looping. The user needs to find a way to get to the steam room. Maybe the steam room is in the Kitchen or Studio. But the user hasn't found it yet. So perhaps the correct action is to go east from Bedchamber, then proceed further. But the user is stuck here. The answer is to go east again, even though it's part of the loop, but maybe that's the way to proceed.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through these rooms according to the given steps. The goal is to venture north, then east, then north again, west, south, west again, pick up the coin in the steam room, and win.

Looking at the current room, it's the Spare Room with exits to the north and west. The user just tried to go east, which wasn't possible, so they ended up here. Now, the next step according to the original plan was to go west after going south. But the user is in the Spare Room now. Let me check the steps again.

The original steps were: north, east, north, west, south, west, then pick up the coin. But the user has been moving in a loop between the Kitchen, Bedchamber, and Spare Room. The current room is Spare Room, with exits to north and west. The next step should be to go west, but maybe that's not working. Wait, the user needs to reach the steam room to pick up the coin. Maybe the correct path is to go north from the Spare Room, then find the right exit to reach the steam room. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west from the Spare Room to reach the Studio again. But the user needs to avoid loops. Since going east from the Bedchamber wasn't possible, maybe the correct next step is to go north from the Spare Room to proceed further. But I need to make sure that the steps align with the original plan. Let me retrace the steps taken so far.

The user started at Studio, went north to Kitchen, east to Bedchamber, west back to Kitchen, south to Studio, north again to Kitchen, east to Bedchamber, then tried south but couldn't. Now in Spare Room. The next step should be to go north or west. Since the original plan after going south was to go west, but that might not be possible. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go north from Spare Room to reach another area. But the goal is to get to the steam room. Maybe the correct next action is to go north from Spare Room to proceed towards the steam room. But I need to check if that's the right direction. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west from Spare Room to reach the Studio again. However, the user needs to avoid loops. Since the previous steps have led to a loop, the next action should be different. The user should try going north from Spare Room to proceed further.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Workshop. The previous actions have taken them through Studio → Kitchen → Bedchamber → Kitchen → Studio → Kitchen → Bedchamber → Spare Room → Workshop. Now, in the Workshop, the exits are south and west. The next step according to the original plan was to go west after going south. But the user is at Workshop, and the next step in the plan is to go west. However, the user might be getting stuck in a loop here. Let me check the steps again.

The original steps were: north, east, north, west, south, west, pick up coin. But the user has already gone through several rooms. Now, in the Workshop, the next step should be west. But the user might have already done some steps. Wait, the user's current position is Workshop. The next step in the plan is to go west from the Workshop. But the user might have already done that. Let me check the history again.

The user's path so far: Studio (north) → Kitchen (east) → Bedchamber (east) → Kitchen (south) → Studio (north) → Kitchen (east) → Bedchamber (south) → Spare Room (north) → Workshop.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in a text-based game, following a specific sequence of directions. The goal is to eventually pick up a coin in the steam room and win.

First, I need to recall the original instructions: venture north, then east, then north again, west, south, west again, then pick up the coin. But the user has been moving through rooms, and now they're in the Bar. The current step is to go south, but the previous action was going west. Let me check the steps taken so far.

Starting from the Studio, they went north (Studio → Kitchen), then east (Kitchen → Bedchamber), then west (Bedchamber → Kitchen again), south (Kitchen → Studio), north (Studio → Kitchen), east (Kitchen → Bedchamber), west (Bedchamber → Spare Room), north (Spare Room → Workshop), west (Workshop → Bar). Now in the Bar, the next step according to the original plan was to go south. But the user tried going south, but the system said "You can't go that way." So maybe the path is different.

Wait, in the Bar, the exits are east and south. The prompt says "You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south." But the user tried going south and got a block. Maybe the correct direction is east? But the original plan was to go south after west. Hmm, perhaps there's a loop here. The user might be stuck in a cycle between rooms. 

Looking at the steps, the user has gone through several rooms but hasn't reached the steam room yet. The coin is in the steam room, so the path must lead there. Maybe the correct sequence after the Bar is to go east again? But the original plan said after Bar, go south. But the system says can't go south. So maybe the user needs to find another way. Alternatively, perhaps the user needs to go east from the Bar, then find another exit. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go south from the Bar, but there's a block. Wait, the user tried going south and got a message saying "You can't go that way." So maybe the correct next step is to go east instead. But according to the original plan, after Bar, the next step was south. But since that's blocked, the user needs to find another path. 

So the next action should be to go east from the Bar. That would take them to the next room, perhaps the Steam Room. Then, from there, pick up the coin. But the original plan was to go west after south, but maybe that's not applicable here. 

So the user is in the Bar, and the next step is to go east. That's the only other exit available. Then, from the Steam Room, pick up the coin. So the correct command here is "go east".

Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and eventually pick up a coin to win. The goal is to follow a specific path: go north, then east, then north again, west, south, west again, and finally collect the coin.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Workshop again after moving east from the Bar. The previous steps have them moving back and forth between rooms, which might indicate they're stuck in a loop. The instruction says to avoid repeating actions if they're not making progress. 

The next step in the original plan was to go west from the Workshop, but that led them back to the Bar. Then, from the Bar, going east brings them back to the Workshop. So, moving east and west repeatedly is causing a loop. 

To break the loop, maybe they need to find a different path. The Workshop has an exit to the south and west. The user was told to go west from the Workshop, but that didn't help. Maybe they need to go south from the Workshop instead. However, the original plan was to go west after reaching the Workshop. Wait, the original steps were: after going north, east, north, west, south, west, then collect the coin. 

But the current position is the Workshop again. The user needs to find the correct path to reach the steam room where the coin is. Maybe they need to go south from the Workshop to the Spare Room, then east to the Bedchamber, then south to the Kitchen, then east to the Studio, then north again? But that seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe the coin is in the Workshop, but the user hasn't checked the rooms yet. 

Wait, the user's last action was going east from the Bar to the Workshop. The Workshop's description mentions listing everything you see. Maybe the coin is in the Workshop, but the user hasn't looked around. However, the original goal was to go to the steam room. Maybe the steam room is a different location. 

Alternatively, the user might have missed a step. The original plan was to go north, east, north, west, south, west, then collect the coin. But the current path is looping between Workshop and Bar. So, perhaps the user needs to find a different route. Maybe from the Workshop, instead of going west, they should go south to the Spare Room, then east to the Bedchamber, then south to the Kitchen, then east to the Studio, then north again. But that's a lot of steps. 

Alternatively, maybe the coin is in the Steam Room, which is part of the path. The user needs to reach the Steam Room. But the current path isn't leading there. The user might need to go west from the Workshop to the Bar, then south to the Kitchen, then west to the Studio, then north again. Wait, but the user is already in the Workshop. 

Hmm, the key is to avoid loops. The user has been moving east and west between the Bar and Workshop. To break the loop, maybe they need to go south from the Workshop to the Spare Room, then east to the Bedchamber, then south to the Kitchen, then east to the Studio, then north again. Then, from the Studio, go east to the Kitchen again, but that might not be right. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west from the Workshop to the Bar, then south to the Kitchen, then west to the Studio, then north again. But the user is already in the Workshop. 

Wait, the original steps were: go north, east, north, west, south, west. So after the first north to Studio, then east to Kitchen, then north again (but the Kitchen has an exit to east and south). Then west from Kitchen to Studio, then south to Kitchen again? This is getting confusing. 

The user needs to collect the coin in the steam room. Maybe the steam room is the Workshop? Or another room. The user needs to check the rooms they've visited. The Studio, Kitchen, Bedchamber, Spare Room, Workshop, Bar. The Steam Room hasn't been mentioned yet. 

Wait, the original instruction said to pick up the coin from the floor of the steam room. So the user needs to find the Steam Room. But in the current path, they haven't reached it. Maybe the Steam Room is the Workshop? Or another room. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go west from the Workshop to the Bar, then south to the Kitchen, then west to the Studio, then north again. But that's not helping. 

The user is in the Workshop. The exits are south and west. The previous steps were going east from the Bar to the Workshop, then west to the Bar again. So, to break the loop, maybe go south from the Workshop to the Spare Room, then east to the Bedchamber, then south to the Kitchen, then east to the Studio, then north again. Then, from the Studio, go east to the Kitchen again. But the user needs to find the Steam Room. 

Alternatively, maybe the Steam Room is the Spare Room. But the Spare Room's description doesn't mention a coin. 

This is getting complicated. The user needs to follow the original steps: after going west from the Kitchen to the Studio, then south to the Kitchen again, then west to the Studio, then north again. But that's not working. 

Wait, the user's last action was going east from the Bar to the Workshop. The Workshop has an exit to the south. So, maybe the next step is to go south from the Workshop to the Spare Room. Then, from the Spare Room, go east to the Bedchamber, then south to the Kitchen, then east to the Studio, then north again. Then, from the Studio, go east to the Kitchen again. But the user needs to collect the coin in the Steam Room. 

Alternatively, maybe the Steam Room is the Bar. But the Bar's description doesn't mention a coin. 

This is confusing. The user needs to follow the original steps but avoid loops. The next step after the Workshop is to go south to the Spare Room, then east to the Bedchamber, then south to the Kitchen, then east to the Studio, then north again. Then, from the Studio, go east to the Kitchen again. But that's not leading to the Steam Room. 

Alternatively, maybe the Steam Room is the Workshop, and the user needs to check there. But the user hasn't picked up the coin yet. 

The user's goal is to pick up the coin in the Steam Room. So, they need to find the Steam Room. The current path hasn't reached it. Maybe the Steam Room is the Spare Room. But the Spare Room's description doesn't mention it. 

This is a puzzle. The user needs to find the correct path to the Steam Room. The original steps might have a different order. Maybe after going west from the Kitchen to the Studio, then south to the Kitchen again, then west to the Studio, then north again. But that's not working. 

Alternatively, maybe the user should go west from the Workshop to the Bar, then south to the Kitchen, then west to the Studio, then north again. Then, from the Studio, go east to the Kitchen again. But that's not helping. 

The user is stuck in a loop between the Workshop and Bar. To break the loop, they need to go south from the Workshop to the Spare Room. Then, from the Spare Room, go east to the Bedchamber, then south to the Kitchen, then east to the Studio, then north again. Then, from the Studio, go east to the Kitchen again. But the user needs to collect the coin in the Steam Room. 

Maybe the Steam Room is the Spare Room. But the user hasn't checked there. So, the next step is to go south from the Workshop to the Spare Room, then check if the coin is there. If not, proceed to the Bedchamber, then Kitchen, then Studio, then north again. 

But the user's next action should be to go south from the Workshop to the Spare Room. That's the only way to break the loop. So, the next command is "go south".

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in a text-based game. The goal is to follow a specific path: venture north, then east, then north again, west, south, west again, and finally pick up the coin in the steam room.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Spare Room (0/13). The previous steps have them moving in a loop between the Workshop, Bar, and Spare Room. The challenge is to break the loop and proceed towards the steam room where the coin is located.

The next step after the Spare Room would be to go north again, but since the user has already been there before, maybe there's a different path. Wait, the goal says after going west, head south, then west again. But the user is currently in the Spare Room, which has exits to north and west. The previous action was going south from the Workshop, which led back to the Spare Room. So maybe the user needs to go west from the Spare Room to exit to the Bar again? But that's where they were before. Alternatively, maybe there's a different exit or a way to reach the steam room through another route.

Wait, the original instructions mention going to the east, then north, then west, then south, then west again, and finally pick up the coin. The user has been moving between rooms without reaching the steam room yet. The steam room isn't mentioned in the current rooms, so perhaps the path requires moving through more rooms. But the current rooms are Studio, Kitchen, Bedchamber, Spare Room, Workshop, Bar. Maybe the steam room is another room not yet visited.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west from the Spare Room to the Bar again, then east to the Workshop, then south to the Spare Room again. But that's looping. The key is to find the correct path that leads to the steam room. Since the coin is in the steam room, the user must reach that room. But the current path isn't leading there. Maybe the user needs to go west from the Spare Room to the Bar, then east to the Workshop, then west to the Bar again, but that's not helpful.

Wait, the user's previous steps were: Studio → Kitchen → Bedchamber → Spare Room → Workshop → Bar → Workshop → Spare Room. So they're stuck in a loop between Workshop and Spare Room. To break the loop, maybe they need to go south from the Workshop again, but that leads back to the Spare Room. Alternatively, maybe there's an exit to the east from the Workshop that wasn't mentioned before. But the Workshop's description says there's an exit to the south and west. The Bar has an exit to the east and south. Maybe the user needs to go west from the Bar to the Workshop again, but that's not helping.

Wait, the original goal is to go north, east, north, west, south, west, then pick up the coin. The user has already done some of these steps. Maybe after reaching the Spare Room, they need to go north to the Studio again, then east to the Kitchen, then north to the Studio again? But that's not following the exact path. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west from the Spare Room to the Bar, then east to the Workshop, then south to the Spare Room again, but that's not progressing.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west from the Spare Room to the Bar, then east to the Workshop, then west to the Bar again, but that's not helpful. It seems like the user is stuck in a loop between the Spare Room and Workshop. To break the loop, perhaps they need to find a different path. But according to the game's current state, the only exits are north and west from the Spare Room. Going west leads to the Bar, which has an exit to the east (Workshop) and south. Maybe the user needs to go south from the Bar to the Workshop again, but that's not helping.

Wait, the user's goal is to reach the steam room. Maybe the steam room is connected to the Workshop or Bar. But the current rooms don't mention it. The user needs to find the correct path. Since the user is in the Spare Room, maybe they should go north to the Studio again, then east to the Kitchen, then north to the Studio again? But that's not following the exact steps. Alternatively, maybe after the Spare Room, go west to the Bar, then east to the Workshop, then south to the Spare Room again. It seems like the user is stuck in a loop and needs to find a different way.

But according to the game's instructions, after going west from the Spare Room, the next step should be south, but that leads back. Maybe the user needs to go east from the Bar to the Workshop again, then west to the Bar, then south to the Workshop again. This is confusing. The key is to follow the original steps: after going west, head south, then west again. But the user is in the Spare Room, so going west would be to the Bar. Then, from the Bar, going south would be to the Workshop. Then from the Workshop, going west to the Bar again. It's a loop. Therefore, the user needs to find another way to reach the steam room.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go north from the Spare Room to the Studio, then east to the Kitchen, then north to the Studio again, then east to the Kitchen, and so on. But that's not following the exact steps. The original steps were: venture north, east, north, west, south, west, then pick up the coin. The user has done some of these steps but is stuck. The correct path might require going through the Steam Room, which is not yet reached. Therefore, the user needs to find a way to get there. Since the current path is looping, the user must try a different action, like going east from the Spare Room to the Bar, then south to the Workshop, then west to the Bar again. But that's not helping. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go north from the Spare Room to the Studio, then east to the Kitchen, then north to the Studio again, then east to the Kitchen, and so on. But this is not leading to the Steam Room.

Wait, the user's goal is to pick up the coin in the steam room. The Steam Room might be a room that's not yet visited. The user needs to reach it. But according to the current rooms, the user hasn't reached it yet. The path must involve going through the Workshop, Bar, Spare Room, and then perhaps another exit. Maybe the user needs to go west from the Bar to the Workshop, then south to the Spare Room again, then west to the Bar, and so on. It's a loop, so the user needs to find a different way. The correct action here is to go west from the Spare Room to the Bar, then east to the Workshop, then south to the Spare Room again. But that's not helping. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go north from the Spare Room to the Studio, then east to the Kitchen, then north to the Studio again, then east to the Kitchen, and so on. But this is not leading to the Steam Room.

The user is stuck in a loop between the Spare Room and Workshop. The next step should be to go west from the Spare Room to the Bar, then east to the Workshop, then south to the Spare Room again. But that's not helping. The user needs to find a way out of the loop. The correct action here is to go west from the Spare Room to the Bar, then east to the Workshop, then west to the Bar again. But this is not progressing. Therefore, the user must try a different action, like going north from the Spare Room to the Studio, then east to the Kitchen, then north to the Studio again, then east to the Kitchen, and so on. But this is not leading to the Steam Room. The user needs to find the correct path to reach the Steam Room, which is the final step.

I am pleased to announce that you are now in the workshop. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.



There is an unblocked exit to the south. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

Okay, let's try to figure out what's going on here. The user is in a text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and eventually pick up a coin to win. The goal is to follow a specific path: go north, then east, then north again, west, south, west, and finally pick up the coin.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Workshop again. The previous steps have them moving back and forth between the Workshop, Spare Room, and Bar. The challenge is to avoid getting stuck in a loop and to find the correct path to the steam room where the coin is located.

The user's last action was "go north" which brought them back to the Workshop. Now, the next step should be to try moving west as per the initial plan. But the game might be trying to prevent them from repeating the same actions, so maybe using a different verb or direction is needed. However, the instructions say to only output the command, so even if there's a loop, the correct next step is still to go west. Alternatively, maybe "go south" again, but the user needs to check if that's allowed. However, the workshop has an exit to the south, so that's a possible direction. But according to the initial plan, after going north again, the next step was to go west. So perhaps the correct next action is to go west again, even if it's a loop, because the game might require that specific sequence. The user needs to follow the exact steps given, even if they loop, to eventually reach the steam room and pick up the coin.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in a text-based game. The goal is to follow a specific path: venture north, then east, then north again, west, south, west again, pick up the coin in the steam room, and win.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Bar room. The previous steps have them moving back and forth between the Workshop, Spare Room, and Bar. The challenge is to avoid looping and reach the steam room to pick up the coin.

The user's last action was going west from the Bar to the Workshop. Now, they need to proceed towards the steam room. The next step should be to go south from the Bar to exit the room and continue towards the steam room. However, the user might be stuck in a loop between these rooms. To break the loop, they need to find a different path or confirm the correct direction. Since the Bar has an exit to the east and south, but the user has already tried going west, the next logical step is to go south to proceed further in the game.

Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text adventure game where they have to navigate through different rooms and eventually pick up a coin to win. The goal is to follow a specific path: go north, then east, then north again, west, south, west, and finally collect the coin.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Laundry Place. The previous steps have them moving back and forth between rooms, which might be causing a loop. The instructions mention that if they're in a loop, they need to try a different action, maybe using a synonym. 

The current room has exits to the north and west. The user has been going back and forth between the Workshop, Bar, Spare Room, etc., so maybe they're stuck in a cycle. The next step should be to break the loop. Instead of repeating the same direction, they might need to try a different path. 

But according to the game's objective, after moving west from the Bar, they should go south to the Laundry Place. From there, the next step is to go north again. However, the user is at the Laundry Place, and the exit to the north is unblocked. So the correct next action would be to go north again. But the user might be stuck in a loop between the Laundry Place and the Workshop. 

Wait, the user's last action was going south to the Laundry Place. The next step according to the original plan was to go west, but the Laundry Place has a west exit. However, the user might have already been there. Maybe the correct path is to go north from the Laundry Place to the Workshop again, then proceed west from there. But the user needs to collect the coin in the steam room. 

Alternatively, maybe the coin is in the Steam Room, which hasn't been visited yet. The user needs to find the Steam Room. The path to the Steam Room might involve going east from the Bar, but the Bar's east exit is unblocked. However, the user has been going back and forth. 

Wait, the original instructions said after going west from the Bar, they should go south to the Laundry Place, then west again. But the Laundry Place's west exit is unblocked. However, the user might be stuck in a loop between the Laundry Place and the Workshop. 

The key is to follow the exact steps: north, east, north, west, south, west, then collect the coin. The user has done most of the movement but might be missing the Steam Room. The Steam Room is probably connected to the Workshop or another room. 

But according to the current room, the Laundry Place has a north exit to the Workshop. So the user should go north to the Workshop again, then west from there. Then, from the Workshop, go south to the Laundry Place again. But this seems like a loop. 

Alternatively, maybe the Steam Room is in the Bar or another room. The user needs to check all rooms. But the coin is in the steam room, which hasn't been mentioned yet. 

Wait, the user's last action was going south to the Laundry Place. The next step according to the original plan was to go west, but the Laundry Place's west exit is unblocked. However, the user might have already been there. 

But the user needs to collect the coin in the Steam Room. So maybe the Steam Room is connected to the Workshop or the Bar. The user needs to find the Steam Room. 

But according to the game's current state, the user is in the Laundry Place. The next step is to go north to the Workshop again. Then, from the Workshop, go west to the Bar. Then, from the Bar, go east to the Workshop again. This seems like a loop. 

Wait, maybe the Steam Room is in the Bar. The user needs to check the Bar for the coin. But the Bar's description doesn't mention a coin. 

Alternatively, the Steam Room is in the Spare Room or another room. The user needs to explore all rooms. 

But the user's goal is to follow the steps: after going west from the Bar, go south to the Laundry Place, then west again. But the Laundry Place's west exit is unblocked. However, the user might be stuck in a loop between the Laundry Place and the Workshop. 

The correct next action is to go north from the Laundry Place to the Workshop again, then proceed west from there. But the user might be repeating the same steps. 

Alternatively, the user should go west from the Laundry Place to the next room, which is the Workshop. Then, from the Workshop, go west to the Bar again. This seems like a loop. 

But according to the original plan, after going west from the Bar, the user should go south to the Laundry Place, then west again. However, the Laundry Place's west exit is unblocked. So the next step is to go west from the Laundry Place. 

But the user is in the Laundry Place, and the west exit is unblocked. So the next action is to go west. However, the user might have already been there.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Steam Room and there's a coin on the floor. The goal is to pick up the coin and then win. The previous steps involved navigating through various rooms, and now they're here. The instruction says to pick up the coin from the floor of the steam room. So the next action should be to pick up the coin. But wait, the game's objective was to venture north, east, west, south, etc., and then pick up the coin. Since they're already in the Steam Room, the next step is to pick up the coin. The command should be "take coin" or "pick up coin". The system message says to output the command, so I need to check if "take coin" is the correct command here. The Steam Room has the coin on the floor, so the correct action is to pick it up. Therefore, the next command is "take coin".
