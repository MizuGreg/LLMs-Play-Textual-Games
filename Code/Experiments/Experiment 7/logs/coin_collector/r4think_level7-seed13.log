Welcome to TextWorld! First of all, you could, like, make an effort to head west. With that done, move south. And then, head east. And then, move east. Next, make an attempt to venture east. Then, make an attempt to go to the east. Next, retrieve the coin from the floor of the scullery. And once you've done that, you win!

FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing TextWorld and needs to follow specific steps to win. The goal is to go west, then south, east, east, then get the coin from the scullery. So far, the user has gone west, south, and east, leading them to the canteen. The next step according to the initial instructions was to go east again. But in the current location (canteen), there's an unguarded exit to the east and west. The user might be stuck in a loop if they keep going east and west. Wait, the initial instructions said after going east twice, they should retrieve the coin from the scullery. But the current location is the canteen. Maybe the scullery is another room. The user needs to find the scullery, get the coin, then win. But the current path is leading them through different rooms. The user has already gone west, south, east, and now in the canteen. The next step should be to go east again to proceed further. But if that's not working, maybe they need to check the other exits. Alternatively, maybe the scullery is accessible from the canteen. Wait, the initial instructions said after moving east twice, retrieve the coin from the scullery. So perhaps after going east from the canteen, they reach the scullery. But the user is at the canteen now. So the next step is to go east again. But the user might be in a loop if they keep moving between rooms. However, according to the instructions, the correct path is to go west, south, east, east, then get the coin. So from the canteen, going east should lead to the scullery. Therefore, the next action is to go east.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in TextWorld to reach the scullery and pick up the coin. The initial steps were go west, south, east, east. Then they were in the canteen, went east to the bar, then east again to the studio. Now, the current room is the studio, and the next step according to the instructions was to go west. But the user is at the studio, and the previous actions might have led them into a loop.

First, the goal is to follow the path: west, south, east, east, then get the coin from the scullery. But the user is now in the studio. The studio's exit is east, but the instruction says to go west. So maybe the next step is to go west from the studio. However, the user might be stuck in a loop between the studio and another room. The key is to check if going west from the studio leads to the scullery or another part of the path. Since the previous steps didn't find the coin, maybe the scullery is accessible from a different direction. But according to the initial instructions, after going east twice, the coin is in the scullery. So perhaps the user needs to go west from the studio to reach the scullery. The next action should be go west.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Bar and Studio. The goal is to get the coin from the scullery. The initial steps were supposed to be west, south, east, east, then get the coin. But the user is repeatedly going back and forth between the Bar and Studio. So, the problem is that the user is stuck in a loop, moving east and west between these two rooms without making progress towards the scullery.

First, the goal is to follow the path: go west, then south, then east, then east again to reach the scullery. But the user has already gone west, south, east, east, and is now in the studio. However, the current path is leading them back to the bar, which is a loop.

Second, the past actions include going west, south, east, east, west, east, west, east, etc. The user hasn't found the scullery yet. The next step should be to find a way to get to the scullery, but the current path isn't working. Maybe the scullery is accessible from a different direction, like north or another exit that's been overlooked.

Third, the user is in a loop between the Bar and Studio. To break the loop, they need to try a different action. Instead of repeatedly going east and west, they should look for other exits. The initial instructions mentioned that after going east twice, the coin is in the scullery. Maybe the scullery is accessible from the studio's east exit. But the user is stuck in the loop, so they need to find another way. Perhaps the correct next step is to go north from the studio, but the description doesn't mention that. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west from the bar to reach the scullery. But the user has to avoid the loop by trying a different direction. Since the previous actions didn't work, the next action should be to go north instead of east or west.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.
