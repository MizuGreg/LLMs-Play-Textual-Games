THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in TextWorld to collect a coin and win. The goal is to pick up the coin from the kitchenette and then win.

Looking at the history, the user has moved through the shower, workshop, lounge, bedchamber, and restroom. The current location is the restroom, and the possible exits are north and south. The previous actions seem to be moving back and forth between rooms without making progress towards the kitchenette.

The user's next step should be to find the kitchenette. Since the restroom has an unblocked exit to the north, maybe that leads closer to the kitchen. But the user has been looping between rooms. The key is to avoid repeating the same actions and find a new path. Maybe instead of going north again, they should check other directions or look for clues. However, in the current room, the only exits mentioned are north and south. The user needs to proceed north to the next room and check if the kitchenette is there. If not, maybe the south exit leads to another area. But the user needs to get to the kitchenette, so continuing north seems necessary. The next action should be to go north from the restroom.

Okay, let's break this down. The user needs to collect a coin from the kitchenette and win. So far, they've been moving through various rooms, but they're stuck in a loop between the Laundromat and Canteen. The previous actions didn't lead them closer to the kitchenette. Now, they need to find a different path. The Laundromat has exits to east and north, but the user tried going south and ended up back at the Laundromat. The next step should be to try going east from the Laundromat instead of north, to avoid the loop. That way, they can explore a new area and maybe find the kitchenette.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Laundromat and Canteen. They've been going back and forth between these two rooms without making progress towards the kitchenette where the coin is. The goal is to pick up the coin and win.

First, I need to recall the game's objective: find the coin in the kitchenette and collect it. So far, the user hasn't reached the kitchenette yet. The current location is the Laundromat, and the possible exits are east and north. The previous actions have been moving between Laundromat and Canteen, which isn't helping.

The user needs to break the loop. Since going north from Laundromat leads to Canteen, and south leads back to Laundromat, maybe trying east from Laundromat is the key. But the user has already tried that and ended up in the Studio, which then loops back. Wait, maybe the exit east from Laundromat isn't leading to the kitchenette. Alternatively, perhaps the user needs to find another path that hasn't been explored yet.

Looking at the previous steps, the user has been moving west and east between rooms, but maybe they need to check other directions. However, in the Laundromat, the exits are only east and north. The user has tried both, leading to the same loop. So, maybe the problem is that the user is not looking for the coin in the current room. The Laundromat might have the coin, but the user hasn't checked. But according to the game's description, the coin is in the kitchenette. So the user needs to find the kitchenette.

Alternatively, maybe the user has passed the kitchenette without realizing. The Canteen is mentioned as having an exit to the west (Laundromat) and south. Maybe the kitchenette is connected to the Canteen or another room. But the user hasn't explored beyond the Canteen yet. The next step should be to go south from the Canteen to check if that leads to the kitchenette. But the user has been going south and back, so maybe that's the way. However, the user is stuck in a loop, so they need to try a different action. Since the previous actions of going north and south aren't working, maybe the user needs to try a different direction, but in the Laundromat, the only options are east and north. Wait, the user is in the Laundromat again, so maybe the correct exit is east, which leads to the Studio, but that's where they were before. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check the items in the current room for the coin. But the game's description says the coin is in the kitchenette. So the user needs to find the kitchenette.

Perhaps the user needs to go east from the Laundromat again, even though it's been tried before. But the user is in a loop, so maybe the correct action is to go east again, but the system is forcing them to loop. Alternatively, maybe the user should try going west from the Studio, but that leads back to the Laundromat. This is confusing. The key is to break the loop by trying a different action. Since the user has been going back and forth between Laundromat and Canteen, maybe the next step is to go east from the Laundromat again, even though it's been tried, but perhaps that's the only way out. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check the items in the current room for the coin, but the game hasn't mentioned it. The user's next action should be to go east from the Laundromat, even if it's been done before, to break the loop.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Laundromat and Canteen. They've been moving back and forth between these two rooms without making progress towards the kitchenette where the coin is. The goal is to pick up the coin and win.

First, I need to recall the game's objective: find the coin in the kitchenette. So far, the user hasn't reached the kitchenette yet. The current location is the Laundromat, and the possible exits are east and north. The previous actions have been moving between Laundromat and Canteen, which isn't helping.

The user needs to break the loop. Since going north from Laundromat leads to Canteen, and south leads back to Laundromat, maybe trying east from Laundromat is the key. But the user has already tried that and ended up in the Studio, which then loops back. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check other directions or look for the coin in the current room. However, the game's description says the coin is in the kitchenette, so the user needs to find that.

The next step should be to go east from the Laundromat again, even though it's been tried before, to break the loop. Alternatively, maybe the user should try a different action, like checking the items in the room for the coin. But the game hasn't mentioned the coin being here. So the correct action is to go east again.

I just think it's great that you've just entered a kitchenette. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.



There is an unblocked exit to the east.

There is a coin on the floor.
