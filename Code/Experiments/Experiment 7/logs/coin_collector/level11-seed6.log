THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text adventure game and needs to follow specific steps to reach the goal. The goal is to eventually lift the coin from the office floor. Let me check the current state.

First, the user has moved through several rooms: closet, basement, sauna, cookhouse, lounge, and workshop. The current room is the workshop. The previous actions were going south, east, north, and now they're in the workshop. The next step according to the initial instructions was to go south from the lounge, but that's already been done. Wait, the user's goal was to go south, then east, then south again, then east, then north, then east, then north again, and finally lift the coin.

But in the workshop, the exits are east and south. The user needs to go south from the workshop. Let me check the previous steps. The user was in the lounge, went north to the workshop. Now, from the workshop, the next step should be south. But the user might be stuck in a loop if they keep moving between rooms without progressing towards the office. The coin is in the office, so the user needs to find the path to the office. Maybe the workshop's south exit leads to the office. Let me confirm the previous steps. The user has already gone through several rooms, but hasn't reached the office yet. So the next step is to go south from the workshop. But the user might have already done that. Wait, the user is in the workshop now. The instruction says after going north to the workshop, the next step was to go east, but the user is in the workshop. Wait, the original goal was: go south, then east, then south, then east, then north, then east, then north, then lift the coin. So after the workshop, the next step is to go south. Let me check the workshop's description. The workshop has an unguarded exit to the east and a suggestion to go south. So the user should go south from the workshop. That would take them to the next room, possibly the office. Then, once in the office, they can lift the coin. So the next action is go south.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Lounge and Workshop. The goal is to lift the coin from the office floor. The previous steps involved moving south, east, north, etc., but they keep cycling between the two rooms.

First, the goal is to reach the office and pick up the coin. The user has been moving back and forth between Lounge and Workshop. The next step should be to find a way to get to the office. The Workshop has an exit to the east, which might be the key. But the user kept going south from the Workshop, which brings them back to the Lounge. So maybe the east exit from the Workshop is the correct path.

Wait, in the Workshop, the description says there's an unguarded exit to the east. The user hasn't tried that yet. Instead, they kept going south, which is why they're looping. So the next action should be to go east from the Workshop, not south. That would take them to a new room, possibly closer to the office. The loop is because they're repeatedly going south and north between the same rooms. Changing the direction to east might break the loop and lead them towards the office where the coin is.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to get to the office to lift the coin. They've been moving between several rooms but keep looping. The current room is the Workshop. The goal steps mentioned earlier were to go south, east, south, east, north, east, north, then lift the coin. But they've been stuck in a loop between Lounge and Workshop.

Looking at the latest steps, they went from Kitchenette west to Workshop. Now, in the Workshop, the exits are east and south. The user needs to find the path to the office. The previous attempts to go south from Workshop just loop back to Lounge. But maybe the east exit from Workshop is the key. However, when they tried going east from Workshop before, they ended up in the Kitchenette, then back to Workshop. So maybe the east exit leads to a different room that's not part of the loop.

Wait, the user is in the Workshop again. The instruction says to go east from Workshop. But earlier, that led to Kitchenette. Maybe from Kitchenette, they can go west to Workshop again, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe from Kitchenette, there's another exit. The Kitchenette has an east and west exit. The user tried going west, which brings them back. But maybe they need to go east from Kitchenette instead. But the user's last action was going west from Kitchenette to Workshop. So perhaps the next step is to go east from Kitchenette again. But the user is in Workshop now. So the next action should be to go east from Workshop, even though it loops, but maybe that's the only way to proceed. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to find another path. But according to the game's structure, the correct path is to go east from Workshop once to reach the Kitchenette, then maybe find another exit. But the user is stuck in a loop, so they need to break it by trying a different direction. The previous actions of going south from Workshop just loop back, so the next step should be to go east again, even if it's the same as before, but maybe that's the correct path. So the next command is go east.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Workshop, Lounge, and Kitchenette. The goal is to lift the coin from the office. The previous steps involve repeatedly moving east and west between these rooms without making progress. The key is to break the loop by finding a different path. The Workshop has an unguarded exit to the east, which led to the Kitchenette, but that doesn't help. Maybe the correct path is to go south from the Workshop to the Lounge, then north to the Workshop again, but that's the same loop. Wait, maybe the user needs to go east from the Kitchenette instead of west. But the user keeps going west, which brings them back. The loop is between Workshop, Lounge, and Kitchenette. The next step should be to try a different direction, like going east from the Kitchenette again, even though it's the same as before, but perhaps that's the only way to proceed. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to find another exit that wasn't explored yet. But according to the game's descriptions, the only exits are the ones mentioned. So the next action is to go east from the Kitchenette.

Okay, the user has finally reached the Office room. The goal was to lift the coin from the floor here. The previous steps involved navigating through various rooms, breaking loops by trying different directions. Now, in the Office, the coin is on the floor. The next logical step is to pick it up. The command should be "take coin" or "lift coin". Since the game mentions "lift the coin", using "lift" might be more accurate. But the exact command depends on the game's accepted verbs. The user is in the Office, so the correct action is to lift the coin from the floor. No loops here anymore, so the next step is to perform the action.

That's not a verb I recognise.
