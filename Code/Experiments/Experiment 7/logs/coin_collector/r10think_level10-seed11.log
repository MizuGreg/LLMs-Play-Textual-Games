Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First thing I need you to do is to attempt to move south. With that done, attempt to go east. And then, take a trip north. Once you do that, make an effort to travel west. With that accomplished, take a trip west. Okay, and then, go to the north. And then, make an effort to move north. Then, try to travel east. After that, venture south. If you can get around to doing that, pick up the coin from the floor of the attic. Got that? Good!

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to pick up the coin from the attic. So far, the path taken has been: south, east, north, west, west, north, which led to the Vault. The next steps mentioned in the initial instructions were to go north again, then east, then south. But in the current position in the Vault, the available exits are north and south. The user needs to find the attic, which is probably north of the Vault since the initial direction after the Vault was north. But the Vault's north exit is unblocked, so maybe going north from the Vault would lead to the attic. However, the user hasn't picked up the coin yet. Wait, the task says to pick up the coin from the floor of the attic. So the user needs to reach the attic, find the coin, and pick it up. The current location is the Vault. The previous steps have moved through several rooms, but the attic hasn't been visited yet. The user needs to go north from the Vault to reach the attic. Then, once in the attic, pick up the coin. So the next action should be to go north from the Vault. But the user is in the Vault, and the available exits are north and south. The user needs to go north to the attic. Then, in the attic, pick up the coin. So the next step is to go north.
