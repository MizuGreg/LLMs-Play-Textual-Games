Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. Your first objective is to try to venture north. After that, head east. That done, go to the east. Next, attempt to travel north. And then, travel west. That done, head south. With that accomplished, make an effort to head west. After that, make an effort to take a trip north. Then, retrieve the coin from the floor of the cubicle. And if you do that, you're the winner!
