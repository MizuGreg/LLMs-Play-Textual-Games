Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an life changing round of TextWorld? You do! Here is your task for today. First stop, venture east. Then, make an attempt to travel east. With that over with, make an attempt to venture north. Then, travel east. Following that, take a trip north. Following that, make an attempt to take a trip west. With that accomplished, venture south. Then, go west. If you can succeed at that, move west. After that, go north. After that, attempt to move north. And then, retrieve the coin from the floor of the studio. That's it!

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to navigate through various rooms in TextWorld, following a specific sequence of movements. The current position is the Canteen again after going west from the Chamber. The previous steps were: Office → Cellar → Workshop → Canteen → Chamber → Canteen (west). The next steps in the original plan were to go south from the Canteen, then west, then north, then north again, and finally retrieve the coin.

But the user is stuck in a loop between the Canteen and Chamber. The problem is that going west from the Canteen leads back to the Chamber, and then going east back to the Canteen. So the same steps are repeating without progress. The key is to find a different path or use synonyms for directions to break the loop.

Looking at the current room (Canteen), the exits are east and south. The original plan was to go south from the Canteen. But if that's not working, maybe trying a different direction. However, the Canteen's exits are only east and south. Wait, the user tried going west from the Chamber, which led back to the Canteen. So maybe the next step should be to go south from the Canteen instead of east. But the user already tried that? Wait, the last action was go west, which brought them back to the Canteen. The Canteen's exits are east (unguarded) and south (unblocked). The next step in the original plan was to go south from the Canteen, then west, then north, etc. But if going south from the Canteen leads to a new room, perhaps that's the way to go. However, the user is stuck in a loop, so maybe they need to try a different action. Alternatively, maybe the coin is in the Canteen, and the user needs to look for it. But the instruction says to retrieve the coin from the floor of the studio. Wait, the studio might be a different room. Maybe the user needs to check the Canteen for the coin. But the original plan was to go to the studio. Alternatively, maybe the coin is in the Chamber or another room. But the user is currently in the Canteen. The next step should be to go south from the Canteen, which was the original plan. But if that's not working, perhaps the user needs to try a different direction. However, the Canteen only has east and south. So the correct next step is to go south, which was the original plan. But the user is stuck in a loop, so maybe they need to try a different action. Wait, maybe the user is supposed to go south from the Canteen, which would take them to a new room, and then proceed as per the plan. But the user is repeating the same steps. So the next action should be to go south from the Canteen.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Canteen and Workshop. The goal is to navigate through various rooms and retrieve the coin from the studio. The previous steps involve moving east, north, west, south, but it's repeating.

First, the goal is to follow the sequence: venture east, travel east, venture north, travel east, take a trip north, take a trip west, venture south, go west, go north, attempt to move north, then get the coin.

But the user is stuck in a loop between Canteen and Workshop. The problem is that going south from Canteen leads back to Workshop, and going north from Workshop leads back to Canteen. So the user is stuck in a cycle without progressing further.

The next step should be to break the loop. Since the user is in the Canteen again, maybe they need to try a different direction. But the Canteen only has east and south exits. The original plan was to go south from Canteen, but that's leading back to Workshop. Wait, maybe the user needs to go east from Canteen instead of south. But the original plan said after going south, then west, etc. But if going east from Canteen leads to a new room, maybe that's the way to go. Alternatively, maybe the coin is in the Canteen, and the user needs to check there. But the instruction says the coin is in the studio. So perhaps the user needs to find the studio through other paths.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to find another exit. But the Canteen's exits are east and south. The Workshop has north and west. So the loop is between Canteen and Workshop. To break it, the user needs to find a different path. Maybe the user should try going east from Canteen, which was the original plan, but that leads to the Chamber. Wait, earlier steps showed that going east from Canteen leads to Chamber. But the user was in the Chamber, then went west back to Canteen. So maybe the user needs to go east again from Canteen to Chamber, then find another way. But the original plan was to go north from Workshop, which leads back to Canteen. So perhaps the user needs to find a different direction. Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go west from Workshop, which is unblocked. But that leads back to Canteen. Hmm.

The key is to break the loop. Since the user is stuck in a cycle between Canteen and Workshop, the next action should be to try a different direction. But the Canteen only has east and south. The user tried south, which leads to Workshop. Maybe the user needs to go east from Canteen to Chamber, then find another exit. But the user was in the Chamber before and went west back. So maybe from Chamber, go north instead of west. The Chamber has a north exit. So from Chamber, go north to the next room. But the user is currently in Canteen. So the next step is to go east from Canteen to Chamber, then north from Chamber. That would be the next step. But the user is in Canteen, so the command should be go east. But the user previously went east and ended up in Chamber. So maybe that's the way to go. Alternatively, the user might need to use a synonym for 'go east' if the system is recognizing the loop. But the user is supposed to avoid repeating the same action. So the next action should be go east from Canteen to Chamber, then proceed north from there. But the user is in Canteen, so the next command is go east.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to navigate through the TextWorld rooms according to the specified sequence and retrieve the coin from the studio. So far, the user has moved through several rooms: Office, Cellar, Workshop, Canteen, Chamber, Parlor, Bedroom, Laundromat, Garage, and now Cubicle. The next steps in the original plan were to go south from the Bedroom, then west, then north, then north again, and finally get the coin.

Currently, in the Cubicle, the exits are east and north. The next step should be to go north from the Cubicle. The original plan mentioned going north after certain steps, so this seems like the right direction. The user needs to check if moving north from the Cubicle leads to the studio where the coin is located. Since the previous steps have taken them through various rooms, moving north here might be the key to reaching the studio. The user should proceed with that action.
