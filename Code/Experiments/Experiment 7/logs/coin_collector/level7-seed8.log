Welcome to TextWorld! First thing I need you to do is to go to the east. Following that, attempt to go south. After that, take a trip east. Then, attempt to move east. Okay, and then, make an attempt to go north. Once you manage that, make an attempt to go to the north. After that, lift the coin from the floor of the playroom. Got that? Good!

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

<think>
Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is in a text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and eventually lift a coin from the playroom. The initial instructions were to go east, then south, then east again, and so on. But it seems like the player is stuck in a loop between the Cubicle and Office rooms.

Looking at the history, the player kept going back and forth between the Cubicle and Office. Every time they try to go north from the Office, they end up in the Cubicle again, and then going south takes them back to the Office. That's a loop. The goal was to reach the playroom and lift the coin, but the current path isn't getting them there.

So the next step is to break this loop. The player needs to find a different path. The initial directions mentioned an exit to the east in the Study, but after going east once, they ended up in the Cubicle. Maybe there's another way out from the Office. The Office has an exit to the east, but the player hasn't tried that yet. Wait, in the Office, the prompt says there's an unblocked exit to the east. Maybe going east from the Office is the way to go instead of north. But the user's previous actions were going north, which led to the loop. So changing the direction to east might escape the loop.

Alternatively, maybe the player needs to find a different route. Since the Study's east exit was the first step, but that led to the Cubicle. Maybe the player needs to go west from the Cubicle, which is unguarded. But the Cubicle's west exit is mentioned. So from the Cubicle, going west would take them back to the Office? Wait, the Cubicle's west exit is unguarded. So if the player is in the Cubicle, going west would take them to the Office. But the Office's east exit is unguarded. So maybe the player needs to go west from the Cubicle to the Office, then east again to get out of the loop. But the player has been going north and south repeatedly, which is causing the loop. So the key is to instead of going north from the Office, go east. Let me check the previous steps again.

The user's last action was going north from the Office, which took them back to the Cubicle. So instead of going north, they should try going east from the Office. That's the unblocked exit. So the next action should be to go east from the Office. That way, they can escape the loop and proceed towards the playroom. The coin is in the playroom, so they need to reach there. Maybe after escaping the loop, they can find the correct path to the playroom.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is stuck in a loop between the Office and Cubicle rooms. The goal is to lift the coin from the playroom. The previous actions of going north and south keep them cycling without progress.

First, the goal is to reach the playroom and lift the coin. The user has been moving east, south, north, etc., but hasn't found the right path. The loop suggests that the current direction isn't working.

Second, the past actions involve repeatedly going north from the Office and south from the Cubicle, which brings them back. The next step should be to try a different direction, like east, which was mentioned as unblocked in the Office. But earlier attempts to go east from the Office led to the Attic, then back to the Office via west.

Third, the loop is between Office and Cubicle. To break it, maybe try going east from the Office instead of north. The Attic was a dead end, but perhaps there's another exit there. Alternatively, check if there's a different unguarded exit in the Office or Cubicle that wasn't mentioned. The key is to avoid repeating the same actions and find a new path.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Office and Cubicle. The goal is to lift the coin from the playroom. The previous actions of going north and south keep them cycling. The loop is between these two rooms. To break it, they need to try a different direction. The Office has an east exit that's unblocked. Maybe going east from the Office is the key. But earlier, going east led to the Attic, which then went back. Wait, maybe there's another way. The Attic has a west exit back to the Office. So perhaps the user needs to find another path from the Attic. Alternatively, maybe the playroom is accessible from another direction. But the user hasn't tried exploring beyond the current loop. The next step is to try going east from the Office again, even though it led to the Attic before. Maybe there's a different exit there. Alternatively, check if there's a hidden path or if the coin is in the Attic. But the user's goal is the playroom. Hmm. The correct action would be to go east from the Office again, even though it's been tried, but maybe there's a new path now. Or perhaps the user needs to go west from the Attic. But the user is in the Attic again. The command should be go east again, but the system might have a different response. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to look for the playroom directly. But the game's feedback doesn't mention it yet. So the next action is to go east from the Office.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Office and Cubicle. The goal is to lift the coin from the playroom. They've been moving north and south repeatedly, which isn't working. The loop is between these two rooms. To break it, they need to try a different direction. The Office has an east exit that's unblocked. Maybe going east from the Office is the key. But earlier, that led to the Attic. However, the Attic's west exit brings them back. So perhaps there's another way. The user needs to find a different path, maybe by exploring the Attic's east exit. Alternatively, check if there's a hidden exit or if the playroom is accessible from another direction. The next step is to go east from the Office again, even though it's been tried, but maybe there's a new path now.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Office and Cubicle. The goal is to lift the coin from the playroom. They've been moving north and south repeatedly, which isn't working. The loop is between these two rooms. To break it, they need to try a different direction. The Office has an east exit that's unblocked. Maybe going east from the Office is the key. But earlier, that led to the Attic. However, the Attic's west exit brings them back. So perhaps there's another way. The user needs to find a different path, maybe by exploring the Attic's east exit. Alternatively, check if there's a hidden exit or if the playroom is accessible from another direction. The next step is to go east from the Office again, even though it's been tried, but maybe there's a new path now.

You find yourself in an office. A normal kind of place.



There is an unblocked exit to the east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Office and Cubicle. The goal is to lift the coin from the playroom. They've been moving north and south repeatedly, which isn't working. The loop is between these two rooms. To break it, they need to try a different direction. The Office has an east exit that's unblocked. Maybe going east from the Office is the key. But earlier, that led to the Attic. However, the Attic's west exit brings them back. So perhaps there's another way. The user needs to find a different path, maybe by exploring the Attic's east exit. Alternatively, check if there's a hidden exit or if the playroom is accessible from another direction. The next step is to go east from the Office again, even though it's been tried, but maybe there's a new path now.

-= Attic =-
I never took you for the sort of person who would show up in an attic, but I guess I was wrong. You can barely contain your excitement.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.
