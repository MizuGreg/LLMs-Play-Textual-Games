THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and eventually pick up a coin in the salon. The goal is to follow the steps provided in the initial instruction.

First, I need to recall the steps mentioned. The user was told to go north, then east, then north again, west, north, south, east, south, east, and finally pick up the coin. But the current location is the Launderette (room 10). The next step according to the initial instructions was to go south, then east, then pick up the coin.

Looking at the current room (Launderette), the exits are east and south. The user previously went west from the Scullery to get here. Now, the next step should be to go south from the Launderette. But the user might be in a loop if they keep going back and forth. However, the instructions say after the Launderette, go south, then east. So the next action should be south. But the user has to make sure they don't repeat the same action if they're in a loop. Since the previous steps have been followed, going south is the next logical step. Then from there, go east to reach the salon and pick up the coin. So the next command is 'go south'.
