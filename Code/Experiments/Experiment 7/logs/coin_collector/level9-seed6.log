THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and find a coin in an office. The goal is to reach the office, pick up the coin, and exit.

Looking at the current room, they're in the Recreation Zone. The previous steps involve moving through various rooms: Closet → Basement → Sauna → Cookhouse → Lounge → Workshop → Kitchenette → Recreation Zone. The next step mentioned was to go north from the Recreation Zone, but that's already been done? Wait, no. Let me check the history again.

Wait, the user just arrived at the Recreation Zone by going east from the Kitchenette. The current room is Recreation Zone. The directions here are north and west. The previous steps included going north from the Lounge to the Workshop, then east to Kitchenette, then east again to Recreation Zone. Now, in the Recreation Zone, the possible exits are north and west. The user needs to find the office, which is probably in a different direction. But according to the initial instructions, after going through various rooms, the next step was to go north from the Recreation Zone. But the user might be stuck in a loop here.

Wait, the initial instructions said: after going south, east, then north, east, east, north, then pick up the coin. But the user hasn't picked up the coin yet. The coin is in the office. So maybe the office is in the north from the Recreation Zone? Let me check the previous steps. The user was in the Kitchenette, then went east to Recreation Zone. From Recreation Zone, going north would take them to the next room. Let's see: the previous rooms were Closet (south), Basement (east), Sauna (south), Cookhouse (east), Lounge (north), Workshop (east), Kitchenette (east), Recreation Zone (current). So from Recreation Zone, going north would be the next step. But the user might have already done that? Or maybe not. The last action was going east to Recreation Zone. So from there, the next step is to go north. But the user needs to reach the office. Maybe the office is in the north from here. Let me check the initial instructions again. The user was told to go south, east, south, east, north, east, north, then pick up the coin. So perhaps the office is in the north from the Recreation Zone. But the user hasn't reached it yet. So the next step would be to go north from Recreation Zone. But the user might be in a loop if they keep moving between rooms without progress. However, according to the game's structure, each room has exits, so the user needs to continue moving until they find the office. The coin is in the office, so the user needs to get to the office, pick up the coin, and then exit. The current room is Recreation Zone. The next step is to go north. But the user might have already done that. Wait, the last action was going east to Recreation Zone. So the next step is to go north from there. Let me check the game's current state. The user is in Recreation Zone, and the possible exits are north and west. The initial instructions said to go north from Recreation Zone. So the user should go north. But the user might be in a loop if they keep moving between rooms. However, according to the game's structure, each move leads to a new room. So the next step is to go north from Recreation Zone. Then, perhaps the office is in that next room. Once there, pick up the coin and exit. So the next action is go north.
