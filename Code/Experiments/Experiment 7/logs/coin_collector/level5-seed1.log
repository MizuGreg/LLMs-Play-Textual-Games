Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First off, make an effort to move south. And then, take a trip east. Then, try to go north. Okay, and then, make an effort to head north. And then, retrieve the coin from the floor of the cookery. Got that? Good!

-= Cookhouse =-
You've just sauntered into a cookhouse. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.



You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.
