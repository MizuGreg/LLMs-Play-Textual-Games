It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First of all, you could, like, try to venture north. After that, head east. That done, go to the east. Next, lift the coin from the floor of the spare room. That's it!

-= Workshop =-
You've entered a workshop. The room is well lit.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north.

-= Kitchen =-
You've just shown up in a kitchen.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and complete certain tasks. The goal mentioned in the initial prompt was to venture north, then east, then lift a coin from the spare room. But the current situation shows they're in the Kitchen, and the next steps are to go east or south.

First, I need to recall the game's objective. The user's goal is to find an unguarded exit and lift the coin. So the steps are: go north from the Workshop, then east to the Kitchen, then maybe further east to the spare room to pick up the coin. But the current location is the Kitchen, and the user is told to try going east again. However, the user might be stuck in a loop if they keep going east and south without progress.

Looking at the previous actions: the user first went north from the Workshop to the Kitchen. Then, in the Kitchen, they were advised to go east or south. The user's next action was to go east again. But if going east leads back to the same place or a loop, they need to try a different direction, like south. However, the user needs to lift the coin, which is in the spare room. So maybe after going east, they need to find the spare room and pick up the coin. But the current prompt says to go east again, so perhaps the next step is to go east again, but if that's not working, they need to try south.

Wait, the user is in the Kitchen. The instruction says to try going east. But if that's not working, maybe they need to go south. However, the user's previous action was going east, so maybe they need to try a different direction. The key is to avoid loops. If going east leads back to the same room, then going south might be the way to go. But the user needs to find the spare room to lift the coin. So perhaps after going east, they need to check the rooms again. Alternatively, maybe the next step is to go east again, but if that's not working, they need to use a synonym like 'move east' or 'head east'.

But according to the instructions, if the previous actions didn't make progress, the user should try a different action. So the next step is to go east again, but if that's not working, maybe go south. However, the user's current prompt says to try going east. So the next action is to go east again. But the user might be in a loop. Wait, the initial steps were: go north (Workshop to Kitchen), then east (Kitchen to maybe another room), then east again. But the user is in the Kitchen now, and the next step is to go east. So the next action is to go east. But the user needs to lift the coin, so maybe after going east, they reach the spare room. Therefore, the next action is to go east.

You've entered a bedchamber.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing a text-based game where they have to navigate through different rooms and find an unguarded exit. The goal seems to be to escape or reach a specific room, maybe the spare room where the coin is located.

First, I need to recall the previous steps. The user started in the Workshop, went north to the Kitchen, then east to the Bedchamber. Now, in the Bedchamber, the prompt suggests going east or west. The user has to avoid loops and find the right path.

The goal is to find an unguarded exit. So far, the user has moved from Workshop to Kitchen to Bedchamber. The next step would be to check the possible directions again. The Bedchamber's description mentions east and west as unguarded. But maybe the user is stuck in a loop if they keep going east or west without progress.

Wait, the initial instructions mentioned going north, then east, then east again, and lifting the coin. But in the current room, the user is in the Bedchamber. Maybe the correct path is to go east again from the Bedchamber. However, if that leads back to a previous room, it's a loop. Alternatively, going west might be the way to go.

But the user needs to avoid repeating actions. Since the previous action was "go east", maybe the next action should be "go west" to break any possible loop. Alternatively, if the user is supposed to go east again, but that's the same as before, maybe using a synonym like "move east" instead of "go east" could help. However, the game might not recognize synonyms, so it's better to check the directions again.

Looking at the current room: Bedchamber. The options are east and west. The user needs to find the correct path. Since the initial plan was to go east from the Kitchen to the Bedchamber, maybe the next step is to go east again from the Bedchamber. But if that's a loop, then west might be the right choice. However, the user needs to follow the initial instructions: after the Bedchamber, the next step was to lift the coin from the spare room. So maybe the correct path is to go east again, leading to the spare room where the coin is. But the user hasn't found the coin yet. Wait, the initial instructions said to lift the coin from the floor of the spare room. So the user needs to reach the spare room.

So, from the Bedchamber, going east might lead to the spare room. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west. But the initial instructions said after the Bedchamber, the next step is to lift the coin. So perhaps the correct path is to go east again. However, the user is in the Bedchamber now, and the next action should be to go east. But the user might be in a loop if that's the same as before. Alternatively, maybe the user should go west. But the initial instructions didn't mention west. So, the user needs to check the directions again.

The current room is Bedchamber. The prompt says: "You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked." So both east and west are possible. The user needs to choose one. Since the initial plan was to go east from the Kitchen to the Bedchamber, maybe the next step is to go east again. But if that leads to a loop, then west might be the way. However, the user hasn't found the coin yet, so the correct path is likely to go east to the spare room. Therefore, the next action should be "go east".

-= Spare Room =-
You are in a spare room. It seems to be pretty normal here.



There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

There is a coin on the floor.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Spare Room, which is part of the TextWorld game. The goal, as mentioned earlier, is to find an unguarded exit and lift the coin from the floor of the spare room.

First, I need to recall the steps taken so far. The user started in the Workshop, went north to the Kitchen, then east to the Bedchamber, and then east again to the Spare Room. Now, in the Spare Room, there's a coin on the floor and an exit to the west. The previous instruction was to lift the coin, so that's the next step. But the user hasn't done that yet. The next action should be to pick up the coin. However, the game might require specific commands like "take coin" or "pick up coin". Since the user is supposed to output a short command, "take coin" is the most direct. But I need to check if the game expects a different verb. Alternatively, maybe "get coin" is the correct command. But the user's previous actions were "go north", "go east", "go east", so the next logical step is to interact with the coin. Therefore, the correct command here is "take coin" or "get coin". Since the game's previous interactions used "go" for directions, maybe "take" is the right verb here. So the next action is to take the coin.
