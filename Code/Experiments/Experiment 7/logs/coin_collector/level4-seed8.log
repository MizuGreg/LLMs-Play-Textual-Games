Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. Your first objective is to go to the east. Following that, attempt to go south. After that, take a trip east. Then, pick up the coin from the floor of the attic. Got that? Good!

-= Study =-
Well, here we are in a study. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Cubicle =-
Well how about that, you are in a place we're calling a cubicle. Let's see what's in here.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text-based game where they need to follow specific steps to reach the coin in the attic. The initial goal was to go east, then south, then east again, and finally pick up the coin.

First, the user started in the Study, went east to the Cubicle. Now, in the Cubicle, the options are south, west, or maybe other directions. The next step according to the original plan was to go south from the Study, but after going east once, they're in the Cubicle. So the next step should be to go south from the Cubicle. But the user might be stuck in a loop if they keep going back and forth. Let me check the previous steps again.

Original plan: Study → East → South → East → Attic (to pick up coin). But after going east from Study, they're in the Cubicle. The next step should be to go south from the Cubicle. However, the user might have already tried that. Wait, the user's last action was "go east" from the Study, leading to the Cubicle. Now, the prompt says in the Cubicle, you can go south or west. The next step according to the plan is to go south. But if going south from Cubicle leads back to Study, that's a loop. Wait, maybe the path is different. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe after the Cubicle, going east again would take them to another area. But the original plan was to go east, then south, then east. So after the first east (to Cubicle), next is south. If that's not working, maybe they need to go west instead, but the original plan didn't mention that. But the user is supposed to follow the steps: first east, then south, then east. So after the first east (Cubicle), next is south. If that's not possible, maybe they need to find another way. But according to the current prompt, in the Cubicle, going south is allowed. So the next step should be to go south. But if that leads back to Study, then maybe the next step is to go east again. Wait, but the original plan was to go east, south, east. So after the first east (Cubicle), then south (maybe to another room), then east again. But the user is in the Cubicle now. So the next step is to go south. But the user might be in a loop. However, the user's previous action was going east, so maybe the next step is to go south. But the user needs to make sure they don't repeat the same action. If going south leads back to Study, then maybe they need to go east again. But according to the plan, after the first east, they should go south. So the next action is go south. But the user might be in a loop. However, the user's next action should be to go south. But the system message says to break the loop if needed. So if going south leads back to Study, which is where they started, then maybe they need to go east again. But according to the original plan, after the first east, they should go south. So the next action is go south. But the user is in the Cubicle, so going south from there would be the next step. Therefore, the next command is go south.
</think>go south

-= Office =-
Well, here we are in the office.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in TextWorld. The goal is to go east, then south, then east again, and finally pick up the coin from the attic.

First, they started in the Study, went east to the Cubicle. Then from the Cubicle, they went south to the Office. Now, in the Office, the prompt says there's an exit to the east, and suggests going north. But the user's next step should be to follow the original plan: after the Office, the next step was supposed to be going east again. Wait, but the original plan was after going south from the Study, then east again. Wait, let me check the initial instructions again.

Original objective: Go east, then south, then east, then pick up the coin in the attic. So the sequence is: Start in Study, go east (to Cubicle), then south (to Office), then east (from Office to maybe the attic?), then pick up the coin.

But in the current state, the user is in the Office. The Office's description says there's an exit to the east, and suggests going north. But according to the plan, after the Office, the next step should be east again. However, the user's previous action was going south from the Cubicle to the Office. So the next step should be east from the Office. But the Office's description says east is unblocked, so maybe that's the way. But the prompt here says "You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north." Hmm, maybe there's a loop here. Wait, maybe the user is being directed north, but the original plan was to go east. So perhaps the user is in a loop between Office and another room. But the user needs to proceed east again. So the next action should be east, even though the prompt suggests north. Maybe the user needs to go east from the Office to reach the next room, which might be the attic. Then, after that, pick up the coin. So the next command should be go east.

-= Attic =-
Well, here we are in an attic.



There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

There is a coin on the floor.

Okay, let's see. The user's goal is to go east, then south, then east again, and pick up the coin in the attic. So far, they've gone east from the study to the cubicle, then south to the office, then east to the attic. Now they're in the attic, which is the fourth step. The next step should be picking up the coin. The prompt says to pick up the coin from the floor of the attic. So the next action is to take the coin. But the previous actions were moving directions. Wait, the user's last action was going east to the attic. Now, in the attic, they need to pick up the coin. The game's current state says there's a coin on the floor. So the correct command here is to pick up the coin. The user hasn't done that yet. So the next step is to take the coin. The previous steps were moving east, south, east. Now, the next step is to pick up the coin. The answer should be "take coin" or "pick up coin". But in the game's context, maybe "take coin" is the correct command. Let me check the previous interactions. The user was told to "pick up the coin from the floor of the attic". So the correct action here is to take the coin. Therefore, the next command is "take coin".
