Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an fast paced round of TextWorld? You do! Your first objective is to go to the east. Following that, attempt to go south. After that, take a trip east. Then, attempt to move east. Okay, and then, make an attempt to go north. Once you manage that, make an attempt to go to the north. After that, move east. Then, venture north. Then, take a trip west. With that accomplished, retrieve the coin from the floor of the cookhouse. Alright, thanks!

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to navigate through various rooms in TextWorld following a specific sequence of directions. The current location is the Playroom, and the next steps according to the initial instructions are to move east, then north, then west, and finally retrieve the coin from the cookhouse.

Looking at the history, the user has already gone from the Study to the Cubicle, then to the Office, Attic, Recreation Zone, Dish-Pit, and Playroom. The next steps in the original plan were to go north from the Playroom, which they did, but that led them back to the Playroom. Wait, no—the last move was from the Playroom to the Dish-Pit? Wait, let me check again.

Wait, the user's last action was "go north" from the Playroom, which took them to the Dish-Pit. Then from the Dish-Pit, they tried going north again, which led to the Playroom. So they're stuck in a loop between the Playroom and Dish-Pit. The original plan after the Playroom was to go east, then north, then west. But since they're looping, they need to find another way.

Wait, the original instructions said: after moving east (from the Playroom), attempt to move east again. Then north, then west. But in the current state, they're in the Playroom again after trying to go north from the Dish-Pit. So maybe they need to go east from the Playroom instead of north. Let me check the current room: Playroom has an unblocked exit to the east and south. The original plan was to go east from the Playroom, then north, then west. But the user tried going north from Playroom, which led to Dish-Pit, then back. So perhaps the correct next step is to go east from Playroom, then proceed as per the plan. But the user is in the Playroom again, so the next action should be to go east. But the user's last action was "go north" from Playroom, which led to Dish-Pit. Now they're back in Playroom, so maybe they need to go east again. But the user's previous action was north, so maybe they need to try a different direction. Wait, the Playroom has an exit to the east and south. The original plan was to go east from Playroom, then north, then west. So the next step is to go east from Playroom. But the user is in Playroom again, so the next action should be "go east".
