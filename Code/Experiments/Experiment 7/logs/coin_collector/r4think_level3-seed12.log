Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First, it would be fantastic if you could go to the west. Then, make an attempt to move west. Next, pick-up the coin from the floor of the closet. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Vault =-
You are in a vault. A standard one. You can barely contain your excitement.



There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

-= Cookhouse =-
You find yourself in a cookhouse. An ordinary one.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

-= Closet =-
You find yourself in a closet. A normal one.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a coin on the floor.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let me try to figure out how to win this game. The user's goal is to pick up the coin from the closet and then exit through the west door. 

First, they started by going west from the vault, which led them to the cookhouse. Then they tried going west again, which brought them to the closet. Now, in the closet, there's a coin on the floor. The next step should be to pick up the coin. But the user hasn't done that yet. 

Wait, the instructions say that after picking up the coin, they're the winner. So the next action should be to pick up the coin. But the user is in the closet now. The previous actions were going west twice. The current location is the closet. The coin is on the floor here. So the next step is to pick up the coin. 

But the user's last action was going west again, which led to the closet. Now, they need to pick up the coin. The problem might be that the user is stuck in a loop if they keep going west. But since they're already in the closet, the next action should be to pick up the coin. 

Wait, the user's previous steps were: go west (vault to cookhouse), go west (cookhouse to closet). Now, in the closet, they need to pick up the coin. So the next action is to pick up the coin. But the game might require using a specific command like 'take coin' or 'get coin'. However, the user's previous commands were 'go west', so maybe the correct command here is 'take coin' or 'pick up coin'. 

But the user's last input was 'go west' again, which might not be necessary because they're already in the closet. Wait, the user is in the closet, and the coin is there. So the next step is to pick up the coin. The user hasn't done that yet. So the correct action is to pick up the coin. 

But the user's previous actions were going west twice. Now, they need to pick up the coin. So the next command should be 'take coin' or 'get coin'. However, the user's instructions say to output the command as a short command. So the correct next action is 'take coin'.
