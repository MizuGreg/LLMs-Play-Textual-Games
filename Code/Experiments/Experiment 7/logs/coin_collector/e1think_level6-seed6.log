Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an profound round of TextWorld? You do! First off, make an attempt to take a trip south. With that done, make an effort to venture east. Once you get around to doing that, go south. And then, go to the east. Then, make an effort to head north. And then, retrieve the coin from the floor of the workshop. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Kitchenette =-
You find yourself in a kitchenette. An ordinary kind of place.



There is an unguarded exit to the south.

You've just sauntered into a basement.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and retrieve a coin to win. The initial steps they took were going south from the kitchenette to the basement. Now, they're in the basement, which has an exit to the north and an unguarded east entrance.

The goal is to retrieve the coin from the workshop. The user's past actions have them move south once, then south again (as per the initial instructions). But in the current state, they're in the basement. The next step according to the initial plan was to go east, then south, then east again, then north, and finally get the coin.

Wait, the user's current location is the basement. The basement has an exit to the north and an east entrance. The initial instruction said after going south (from kitchenette to basement), then east, then south, then east, then north, then get the coin. But the user has only gone south once so far. So the next step should be to go east from the basement. But the user might be stuck in a loop if they keep going back and forth. However, the user hasn't actually done the east move yet. So the next step is to go east from the basement. Then, from the east side, maybe they can go south again. But the user needs to check if moving east leads them to a new area where the coin is located. Alternatively, maybe the workshop is in a different part. But according to the initial plan, after going east from the basement, they should go south again. But the user needs to follow the steps as instructed. The next action should be to go east from the basement. Then, from there, proceed south, then east again, then north, and finally retrieve the coin. So the next command is to go east.

-= Sauna =-
Look around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a sauna.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in TextWorld to win the game. The goal is to retrieve the coin from the workshop and then reach the end.

First, I need to recall the previous steps. The user started in the Kitchenette, went south to the Basement, then east to the Sauna. Now, in the Sauna, the options are to go south or west. The previous actions were: go south (Kitchenette -> Basement), then east (Basement -> Sauna). Now, the next step should be to go south from the Sauna. But wait, the user's goal was to go south, east, south, east, north, then get the coin. But maybe the path is a loop?

Wait, the user's goal was: start by going south, then east, then south, then east, then north, then get the coin. But in the current room (Sauna), the available exits are south and west. If the user goes south from Sauna, maybe they'll end up in a different room. But the user might be looping between rooms. Let me check the previous steps again.

Original instructions: After starting, go south, then east, then south, then east, then north. Then get the coin. But in the current state, the user is in the Sauna. The previous steps were: Kitchenette (south) -> Basement (east), then Basement (east) -> Sauna. Now, from Sauna, the user needs to go south or west. If they go south, maybe they reach the Basement again? But the user needs to go east again. Wait, maybe the path is a loop between Sauna and Basement? Or perhaps the correct path is to go west from Sauna to reach another room.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west from Sauna to exit to the north, but that's not clear. The user's goal is to get the coin in the workshop. So perhaps the correct path is to go south from Sauna to reach a room that leads to the workshop. But the user needs to follow the steps: south, east, south, east, north. But in the current step, they are in Sauna. The next step should be to go south, but if that leads back to Basement, then maybe they need to go east again. But the user might be stuck in a loop. So, the user needs to find a way to proceed without repeating the same action. Maybe using synonyms like 'go south' vs 'move south' or 'head south'.

But the user's previous action was 'go east' from Basement to Sauna. Now, in Sauna, the next step is to go south. If that's the correct direction, then proceed. But if that leads back to Basement, then maybe the user needs to go east again. However, the user's goal is to go south, east, south, east, north. So after Sauna, the next step is south, then east, then north. But maybe the user is in a loop between Sauna and Basement. So, the next action should be to go south from Sauna. But the user needs to check if that's the right path. Alternatively, maybe the user should go west from Sauna to reach a different room. But the user's goal is to go east again. So, perhaps the correct next step is to go south from Sauna, even if it loops, but eventually reaches the workshop.

-= Cookhouse =-
You are in a cookhouse. An ordinary one. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?



There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Now, the next step should be to go east from the cookhouse. But the user might be getting stuck in a loop. Let me check the directions again.

In the cookhouse, the exits are east and north. The original plan was to go east, then south, then east, then north. But after going east from the cookhouse, the next room would be...? The user hasn't reached the workshop yet. The coin is in the workshop, so maybe the path requires moving east again from the cookhouse. But the user needs to make sure they aren't looping. Since the cookhouse has an exit to the east, going east is the next logical step. The user should proceed east to continue their journey towards the workshop.

You've entered a lounge. Let's see what's in here.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in a text-based game. The goal is to eventually retrieve a coin from the workshop and win. Let me track their movements so far.

Starting in the Kitchenette, they went south to the Basement. Then east to the Sauna, south back to the Cookhouse, east to the Lounge. Now, in the Lounge, the directions mentioned are north and west. The previous steps involved moving south, east, etc., but they haven't found the workshop yet.

The user's past actions have taken them through several rooms but haven't reached the workshop. The next step according to the initial instructions was to go north from the Lounge. However, the user might be stuck in a loop if they keep moving between rooms without progress. The key is to find the workshop and get the coin.

Looking at the current room, the Lounge has exits to north and west. The user needs to find a path that leads to the workshop. Since the previous moves didn't lead directly there, maybe trying a different direction or using a synonym for the action could help. But the instruction says not to repeat the same action if it's not working. The next logical step would be to go north from the Lounge, as that's the direction mentioned. But if that doesn't work, maybe west? However, the user needs to follow the original plan: after the Lounge, the next step was to go north, then retrieve the coin. But since the user is in the Lounge, the next action should be north. However, the user might be in a loop, so perhaps trying a different direction. But according to the problem statement, the user should follow the steps: after the Lounge, go north. But the user might have already done that. Wait, the initial plan was to go south, east, south, east, north, then get the coin. But in the current state, they're in the Lounge. The next step according to the original plan was to go north. But the user might be stuck. However, the user needs to follow the steps as per the initial instructions. So the next action is to go north from the Lounge. But the user might be in a loop. However, the problem says to not repeat the same action if it's not working. But the user hasn't found the workshop yet. So the next step is to go north. But the user is in the Lounge, and the previous steps were moving east and south. Maybe the correct next step is to go north from the Lounge. But the user needs to check if that leads to the workshop. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west. But according to the original plan, after the Lounge, the next step was to go north. So the answer should be go north.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

There is a coin on the floor.

Starting in the kitchenette, they went south to the basement, then east to the sauna, south to the cookhouse, east to the lounge, north back to the workshop. Now, in the workshop, they found a coin on the floor. The next step should be to pick up the coin. But the game's instruction says to retrieve the coin from the floor of the workshop. So the correct action here is to take the coin. The previous actions have led them to the workshop, so the next logical step is to pick up the coin. Since the coin is on the floor, the command should be "take coin" or "get coin". The user needs to do that to win. I need to make sure that the command is correct and matches the game's expected input.
