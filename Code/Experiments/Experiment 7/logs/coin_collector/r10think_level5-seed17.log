I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! First of all, make an attempt to head east. Following that, make an attempt to venture south. Then, make an effort to take a trip south. And then, make an effort to travel south. If you can manage that, pick-up the coin from the floor of the office. That's it!
