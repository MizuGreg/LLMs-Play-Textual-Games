I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! First of all, you could, like, head north. With that accomplished, go to the north. Then, make an effort to go north. Then, travel east. And then, make an effort to move north. Once you succeed at that, go to the north. With that accomplished, venture west. Once you get around to doing that, move north. After that, recover the coin from the floor of the scullery. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Chamber =-
You arrive in a chamber. An ordinary kind of place. You start to take note of what's in the room.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Bar and Sauna. The goal is to recover the coin from the scullery and win. So far, they've been going back and forth between north and south, which isn't helping. The next step should be to find the scullery. Maybe the coin is in the scullery, so they need to go east from the sauna. Wait, the sauna has an exit to the east. Let me check the previous steps. The user was in the sauna, tried going south, ended up back in the bar. Maybe they need to go east from the sauna instead of south. That would take them to a new room, possibly the scullery. Then, once there, pick up the coin. So the next action should be going east from the sauna.

Okay, let's break this down. The user needs to recover the coin from the scullery to win. So far, they've been stuck looping between the Bar and Sauna, going north and south repeatedly. The previous attempts to go east from the sauna were blocked, so maybe they need a different approach.

First step: The goal is to get to the scullery, find the coin, and pick it up. The user hasn't reached the scullery yet, so the next step is to find a way there.

Second step: Past actions include moving between Bar and Sauna, but no progress toward the scullery. The next logical step would be to explore other exits or look for clues about the scullery's location.

Third step: The loop is between Bar and Sauna. To break it, maybe the user needs to look for another exit or check the room's description for hints. Since the Sauna has an east exit that was previously blocked, perhaps there's a different path or a hidden exit.

Final action: Since going east from the sauna was blocked before, maybe the user needs to check the south exit from the Bar again or look for another way. Alternatively, maybe the scullery is accessible from the Playroom. The user should try moving north from the Playroom to check.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Bar and Sauna. The goal is to get the coin from the scullery. So far, they've been going back and forth between north and south, which isn't helping. The next step should be to find the scullery. Maybe the coin is in the scullery, so they need to go east from the sauna. Wait, the sauna has an exit to the east. Let me check the previous steps. The user was in the sauna, tried going south, ended up back in the bar. Maybe they need to go east from the sauna instead of south. That would take them to a new room, possibly the scullery. Then, once there, pick up the coin. So the next action should be going east from the sauna.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Bar and Sauna. The goal is to get the coin from the scullery. So far, they've been moving north and south without progress. The next step should be to find the scullery. Maybe the coin is in the scullery, so they need to go east from the sauna. But earlier attempts to go east were blocked. Wait, maybe the scullery is accessible from the Playroom. The user was in the Playroom earlier, which has a north and south exit. Maybe they need to go north from the Playroom to reach the scullery. Let me check the previous steps. The user was in the Playroom, then went north to the Bar, then back and forth. So the next action should be going north from the Playroom to check the scullery.
