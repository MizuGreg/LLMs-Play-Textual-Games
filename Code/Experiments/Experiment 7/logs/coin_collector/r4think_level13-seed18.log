Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First off, venture north. And then, travel north. And then, venture east. Following that, attempt to go to the east. That done, go to the south. And then, attempt to go west. Next, venture north. Okay, and then, head north. After that, take a trip west. And then, move west. Then, make an effort to move south. With that done, attempt to take a trip south. Then, pick-up the coin from the floor of the shower. Alright, thanks!

Look at that notice! What does it say? It says Welcome to the sauna? Well that's cool.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is in a text-based game where they have to follow a series of directions to reach a goal, which seems to be picking up a coin from the shower. The current location is the Workshop, and the previous actions were going north twice, then east, south, west, etc. But the user is stuck in a loop because they keep going back and forth between rooms without making progress.

First, I need to recall the goal: pick up the coin from the shower. The user has been moving around the sauna, closet, workshop, and other rooms, but maybe they haven't found the shower yet. The challenge is to navigate through the rooms without getting stuck in a loop.

Looking at the current environment, the Workshop has an exit to the east and a suggestion to go south. The user's previous actions included going north, east, south, west, and repeating some directions. The key is to find a path that leads to the shower and then collect the coin.

The user might be stuck because they keep moving in the same directions, leading them back to already visited rooms. To break the loop, they need to try different directions or find a new path. Since the Workshop has an exit to the east, maybe that's the way to go. Alternatively, the south direction was suggested, but the user might have already tried that.

The next step would be to go east from the Workshop. If that leads to a new room, they can continue exploring. If not, maybe try south again. But since the user is in a loop, they need to vary their actions. The answer should be to go east to proceed further.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in a text-based game, following a series of directions to eventually pick up a coin from the shower. So far, they've moved through the Sauna, Closet, Workshop, Studio, Chamber, and now the Cubicle. The goal is to find the shower and collect the coin.

Looking at the current room, the Cubicle, the user is told there's an unguarded exit to the west and north. The previous actions were going east from the Studio, then south to the Chamber, and now to the Cubicle. The user needs to continue moving towards the shower. Since the shower is the target, maybe the next step is to go north from the Cubicle. But wait, the user has been moving in a loop between rooms. The key is to avoid repeating the same path and find the correct direction that leads to the shower. The next action should be to go north to check if that leads to the shower or another room that's part of the path. Alternatively, maybe west, but the user needs to ensure they're not stuck in a loop. The answer should be to go north.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Chamber and Cubicle. They keep going back and forth between these rooms. The goal is to pick up the coin from the shower. So far, they've been moving north and south, which is causing the loop.

First, I need to figure out why they're stuck. The problem is that the same directions are leading them in circles. The key is to find a different path. The previous actions were going north and south, which might not be leading them closer to the shower.

Looking at the current room, the Cubicle has an exit to the west. Maybe they should try going west instead of continuing north or south. The user has been repeating north and south, so changing direction to west could break the loop.

The next step should be to go west from the Cubicle. That way, they might find a new path that leads towards the shower instead of looping back. So the command should be "go west".

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Study and Cubicle. They keep going east and west, which isn't leading them closer to the shower. The goal is to pick up the coin from the shower. Previous actions have been repetitive, so they need to try a different direction.

Looking at the current room, the Cubicle has an unguarded exit to the west. But the user has been going back and forth. Maybe they need to try going north instead of west. The Study has an exit to the north, so perhaps that's the way to go. The next action should be "go north" to break the loop and explore a new path.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Chamber and Cubicle again. They've been going back and forth between these rooms without making progress towards the shower. The goal is to pick up the coin from the shower, but they haven't found it yet.

Looking at their past actions, they tried going east from the Study, which led them back to the Cubicle. Then they kept going north and south, which is causing the loop. The key is to break this cycle. The previous attempts to go north and south aren't working, so they need a different direction.

The Cubicle has an unguarded exit to the west. Maybe they should try going west instead of continuing north or south. That way, they might find a new path that leads closer to the shower. The next action should be "go west" to break the loop and explore a new direction.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.
