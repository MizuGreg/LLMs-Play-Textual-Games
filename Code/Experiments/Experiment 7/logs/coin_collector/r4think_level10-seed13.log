THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms to find a coin in the kitchen. The goal is to follow specific directions: west, south, east, east, east, north, west, south, then pick up the coin.

Looking at the current location, the user is in the Bar. The previous steps were moving west from the Laundromat to the Chamber, then south to the Closet, east to the Canteen, and east again to the Bar. Now, the next step according to the initial instructions was to try going east again. But the user might be stuck in a loop here.

The Bar's description says to try going east or west. The user has already tried east once. Maybe trying west now would be the next step. But the initial instructions said after the Bar, go north. Wait, the original plan was after the Bar, attempt to go north. But the user is at the Bar, and the previous action was going east. So maybe the next step is to go north from the Bar. However, the Bar's description says to try east or west. If going north isn't an option here, perhaps the user needs to find another way. Alternatively, maybe the user is in a loop between the Bar and another room. The key is to follow the original plan step by step without repeating actions. Since the user is at the Bar, the next step should be to go north as per the initial instructions. But if that's not possible, maybe the user needs to find a different path. However, the current prompt says to go north from the Bar. Let me check the previous steps again. The original plan was: after the Bar, go north. So the next action should be go north.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Canteen and Bar. The goal is to reach the kitchen and pick up the coin. The initial plan was to go west, south, east, east, east, north, west, south, then get the coin. But the user is repeatedly moving between the Canteen and Bar, which suggests they're not following the correct path.

Looking at the current location, the user is in the Canteen again. The previous actions were going east and west repeatedly. The problem is that the user is stuck in a loop here. The original plan after the Bar was to go north, but that's not possible. So maybe the correct approach is to find another way. Wait, the initial instructions said after the Bar, go north. But the Bar's exits are east and west. Maybe the user needs to find a different path. Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go south from the Bar, but the description says to try west. Hmm.

Wait, the user's goal is to get to the kitchen. The kitchen is mentioned in the first instruction. The user has to follow the steps: west, south, east, east, east, north, west, south, then pick up the coin. But the current path is looping between Canteen and Bar. So maybe the user is not following the correct sequence. Let me check the steps again.

Original steps: Start at Laundromat, go west to Chamber, south to Closet, east to Canteen, east to Bar, then north. But in the current state, the user is in the Bar, and trying to go east or west. The original plan was after the Bar, go north. But the Bar's exits are east and west. So maybe the user is supposed to go north from the Bar, but that's not an option. Therefore, the user is stuck. The loop is between Canteen and Bar. To break the loop, the user needs to find another way. Maybe the user should try going south from the Bar, but the description says to try west. Wait, the Bar's description says: "You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded." So maybe the user should go west from the Bar to the Canteen, then east to the Bar again. But that's the loop. So the user is stuck in a loop between Canteen and Bar. The problem is that the user is not moving towards the kitchen. The original plan was to go south from the Bar, but that's not an option. Therefore, the user needs to find another way. Maybe the user is supposed to go south from the Bar, but the description doesn't mention it. Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go east from the Bar to a different room. But the current description doesn't show that. So the user is stuck in a loop. The next step is to try a different action, maybe using a synonym. Since the user is in the Bar, maybe the correct action is to go south, even though the description says to try east or west. But the user has to break the loop. So the next action should be to go south, even if it's not mentioned. Alternatively, maybe the user should go east again. But that's the same as before. Wait, the user is supposed to go north from the Bar, but that's not possible. Therefore, the user needs to find another path. Maybe the user is in the Bar and needs to go south to the Closet, but the description doesn't mention that. Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go east from the Bar to a different room. But the current description doesn't show that. So the user is stuck. The next action should be to go south, even if it's not in the description, to break the loop. So the answer is go south.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms to find a coin in the kitchen. The goal is to follow specific directions: west, south, east, east, east, north, west, south, then pick up the coin.

Looking at the current location, the user is in the Bar again. The previous steps were moving between the Canteen and Bar, which suggests they're not following the correct path. The user is stuck in a loop between the Canteen and Bar. The original plan was to go north from the Bar, but that's not possible. So maybe the user needs to find another way. However, the Bar's exits are east and west. The user tried going west to the Canteen and east to the Bar again, creating a loop.

The key is to break the loop. The user needs to find a different path. The Studio room was previously mentioned, but the user hasn't explored it yet. The Studio has exits to east and west. Maybe the user should go east from the Studio to reach the kitchen. But how to get to the Studio? The user was in the Bar, so maybe going west from the Bar to the Canteen, then east to the Studio. Wait, the user is in the Bar, and the previous action was going west to the Canteen. Then, from the Canteen, going east leads to the Bar again. But the Studio is a new room. Maybe the user needs to go east from the Bar to the Studio. But the Bar's description says to try east or west. So, the user should go east from the Bar to the Studio. Then, from the Studio, go west to the Bar again, but that's the loop. Alternatively, from the Studio, go east to another room. But the user's goal is to reach the kitchen. The initial steps required going south from the Bar, but that's not possible. So, the user needs to find another way.

-= Cookhouse =-
You've entered a cookhouse. You begin to take stock of what's here.



There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in a text-based game to find a coin in the kitchen. The goal is to follow specific directions: west, south, east, east, east, north, west, south, then pick up the coin.

Looking at the current location, the user is in the Cookhouse. The previous steps were moving from the Studio to the Scullery, then to the Cookhouse. The Cookhouse has an exit to the south and a suggestion to go west. The user needs to continue following the original plan. The next step after the Cookhouse should be to go west, as per the initial instructions. But the user has to check if that's the correct direction. The original plan after the Bar was to go north, but that's not possible. Now, in the Cookhouse, going west might lead to the next room. The user needs to proceed west from the Cookhouse to continue their journey towards the kitchen. So the next action is to go west.
