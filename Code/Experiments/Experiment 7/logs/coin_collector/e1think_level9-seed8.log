You are now playing a exciting round of TextWorld! First of all, go to the east. Following that, attempt to go south. After that, take a trip east. Then, attempt to move east. Okay, and then, make an attempt to go north. Once you manage that, make an attempt to go to the north. After that, move east. Then, venture north. Then, pick-up the coin from the floor of the cookhouse. And once you've done that, you win!

Okay, let's break this down. The user is playing a text-based game where they need to follow a specific sequence of movements to reach the cookhouse and pick up the coin. The current location is the Cubicle, and the user has already gone east from the Study.

First, the goal is to follow the steps: go east, then south, east again, then try east again, north, north again, east, north, pick up the coin, and win. But the user is in the Cubicle now. The previous action was going east from the Study, which led them to the Cubicle. The Cubicle has an exit to the south and a west entrance.

The user's next step according to the initial instructions was to attempt to go south. But the current prompt says there's an exit to the south, so going south from the Cubicle would be the next logical step. However, the user might be stuck in a loop if they keep moving back and forth. But since the instructions say to attempt south after being in the Cubicle, that's the next step. The user needs to go south from the Cubicle to proceed further. Then, after that, they can move east again as per the plan. So the next action should be 'go south'.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing a text-based game called TextWorld. The goal is to follow a series of directions to reach the cookhouse and pick up the coin, then win.

First, I need to break down the steps they need to take. The initial instructions say: go east, then south, east, east, north, north, east, north, pick up the coin, and win. But the user is currently in the Office, and the previous moves were go east from the Study, then go south to the Cubicle, then go south again to the Office. Wait, no, the user's last action was "go south" from the Cubicle, which led them to the Office. Now, in the Office, the description mentions an unblocked exit to the north. 

Looking at the game's current state, the user is in the Office. The next step according to the original plan was to go east, but the Office's description says to try going east (since there's an exit to the north). Wait, the original plan after the Office was to move east, then venture north, etc. But the user's previous actions were: Study -> East (Cubicle), then South (Office). Now, in the Office, the next step should be to go east as per the original plan. However, the Office's description says there's an exit to the north, but the user's next step is supposed to be east. 

Wait, maybe the user is getting confused. Let me check the original steps again. The user's initial instructions were: go east (from Study), then south (to Cubicle), then east (to Office?), then attempt to move east again, then north, etc. But in the current state, the user is in the Office, and the description says there's an exit to the north. So perhaps the next step is to go north from the Office. But according to the original plan, after entering the Office, the next step was to move east. However, the Office's description says to try going east (since there's an unblocked exit to the north). Wait, the Office's description says: "You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. There is an unblocked exit to the north." So maybe the user is supposed to go east first, but the description is a bit confusing. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is in the Office, and the next step is to go north. But according to the original plan, after the Office, the next steps were to move east, then north. But the user's current position is the Office, and the next step in the original plan was to go east. However, the Office's description says there's an exit to the north. So perhaps the user needs to go north from the Office. But the original plan says after the Office, go east. Wait, maybe the user is in the Office, and the next step is to go east. But the description says to try going east, but there's also an exit to the north. 

This is a bit confusing. The user's previous actions were: Study -> East (Cubicle), then South (Office). Now, in the Office, the next step according to the original plan was to go east. But the Office's description says to try going east. So the next action should be east. However, the user might be in a loop if they keep going back and forth. But the user's next action should be east. However, the Office's description says there's an exit to the north. So maybe the user should go north. But according to the original plan, after the Office, the next step was to move east. So perhaps the user is supposed to go east again. 

Wait, the original plan was: go east (Study), then south (Cubicle), then east (Office?), then attempt to move east again, then north, etc. So in the Office, the next step is to go east. But the Office's description says there's an exit to the north. So maybe the user is supposed to go north. But according to the original steps, after the Office, the next step is to go east. 

This is a bit conflicting. The user's current position is the Office. The next step in the original plan is to go east. However, the Office's description says to try going east (since there's an unblocked exit to the north). Wait, the description says: "You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. There is an unblocked exit to the north." So maybe the user is supposed to go east first. But the exit to the north is also there. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is in the Office, and the next step is to go north. But according to the original plan, after the Office, the next step is to move east. So perhaps the user is supposed to go east again. 

But the user's previous action was "go south" from the Cubicle to reach the Office. Now, in the Office, the next step is to go east. However, the Office's description says to try going east. So the next action should be east. But the user might be in a loop if they keep moving between rooms. 

But according to the original plan, after the Office, the next step is to move east. So the user should go east from the Office. However, the Office's description says there's an exit to the north. So maybe the user should go north. 

This is confusing. The user needs to follow the original steps: after the Office, move east, then north, etc. So the next action should be east. But the Office's description says to try going east. Therefore, the correct next action is east. However, the user might be in a loop if they keep moving between rooms. 

But according to the original plan, the user is supposed to go east from the Office. Therefore, the next action is east.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in TextWorld according to the given instructions. The goal is to eventually pick up the coin in the cookhouse and win.

First, I need to recap the game's objective step by step. The user has to go east, then south, then east again, attempt to go east again, then north twice, then east, north again, pick up the coin, and win. 

Looking at the user's past actions: They started in the study, went east to the cubicle, then south to the office, then east to the attic. Now they're in the attic. The next step according to the original plan was to go east again. But the current room (attic) has an exit to the east and west. The user has already gone east once from the attic, so maybe they need to check if they've followed the correct path.

Wait, the original instructions say after the attic, the next step is to attempt to move east again. But the user is in the attic, and the exit to the east is unblocked. So the next action should be to go east again. However, the user might be in a loop if they keep moving east and west. But according to the current room description, the exit to the east is unguarded, so going east should be possible.

But the user's previous action was "go east" leading to the attic. Now, in the attic, the next step is to go east again. However, the user might be repeating actions without progress. But according to the game's structure, each room has specific exits. The attic's east exit is unblocked, so going east should lead to the next room. The user needs to continue following the original plan: after the attic, go east, then north, etc.

So the next command should be "go east" again. But the user might be in a loop if they keep moving east and west. However, the current room's description says the east exit is unblocked, so it's safe to proceed. Therefore, the next action is "go east".

The goal is to follow a specific sequence of movements: go east, then south, then east again, then east again, then north, then north again, then east, then north, pick up the coin in the cookhouse, and win.

So far, the user has moved from the Study to the Cubicle (south), then to the Office (east), then to the Attic (east), then to the Recreation Zone (east). Now, in the Recreation Zone, the prompt says there's an exit to the west and north. The next step in the original plan was to venture north after moving east. But the user is in the Recreation Zone, and the previous actions have been going east multiple times. 

Wait, the original instructions said after moving east, attempt to go south, then east, then east, then north, then north, then east, then north. But the user's path so far has been east, south, east, east. Now in the Recreation Zone, the next step according to the plan would be to go north. However, the user might be in a loop if they keep going east and west. But in the Recreation Zone, the exits are north and west. The user needs to go north to proceed towards the cookhouse. The coin is in the cookhouse, so maybe after moving north from here, they can reach the cookhouse. So the next action should be north. But the user has to make sure they're not repeating actions that don't progress. Since the previous steps were east, the next logical step is north as per the plan. So the answer is go north.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is playing a text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and eventually pick up a coin in the cookhouse to win. The goal is to follow a specific sequence of movements: go east, then south, east again, then east again, north, north again, east, north, and finally pick up the coin.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Laundry Place. The previous actions have been moving east, south, east, north, and now they're in the Laundry Place. The next step according to the initial instructions was to move east again. However, the user has already moved east multiple times, so there might be a loop here.

The user's past actions include moving east from the Study to the Cubicle, then south to the Office, east to the Attic, east to the Recreation Zone, north to the Laundry Place. Now, the next step should be to go north again, as per the original plan. But the user might be stuck in a loop between the Laundry Place and the Recreation Zone. The instructions mention that if the previous actions aren't making progress, a different action (synonym) should be used. However, the user needs to continue moving towards the cookhouse.

The cookhouse is likely in a different area, so the user needs to keep moving east or north. The next step after the Laundry Place is to go north again, which would take them to the next room. But the user needs to check if that's the correct direction. Alternatively, maybe moving south from the Laundry Place would lead them back towards the Recreation Zone, but that might not be helpful. The key is to follow the original plan: after the Laundry Place, move north again, then east, then north, and finally pick up the coin.

So the next action should be to go north from the Laundry Place. But the user has already done that. Wait, the user is in the Laundry Place, and the previous action was going north. The exit to the north is unguarded. So the next step is to go north again. However, the user might be looping between rooms. But according to the original plan, after the Laundry Place, they should move east. Wait, the original plan says: after moving north twice, then move east, then north again. So after the Laundry Place, the next step is to go east. But the user is in the Laundry Place, and the exit to the west is unblocked. So maybe moving west would take them back. But the original plan says to go east from the Laundry Place. Wait, the original instructions said: after moving north twice, move east, then north.

The next step according to the original plan is to move east again. But the user is in the Laundry Place, and the exit to the east is not mentioned. Wait, the Laundry Place has an exit to the north and south. The user needs to go east to reach the cookhouse. But maybe the cookhouse is in the north. Alternatively, the user needs to find the correct path. The key is to follow the original plan: after moving north twice, move east, then north again. So from the Laundry Place, moving east would be the next step. But the user is in the Laundry Place, and the exit to the east is not mentioned. Wait, the Laundry Place's description says there's an exit to the west and north. So moving east might not be possible. Therefore, the user needs to go north from the Laundry Place to reach the next room, then proceed east. But the user has already moved north once.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Playroom. The previous actions have been moving east and north through various rooms. The next step according to the initial instructions was to move east again. However, the user has already done that, and now they're in the Playroom. The challenge here is to figure out the next correct move without getting stuck in a loop.

The Playroom has exits to the south and east. The user needs to continue moving towards the cookhouse. Since the next step in the original plan was to go north from the Playroom, but the user is already in the Playroom, maybe they need to check if moving south or east is the right direction. However, the original plan says after moving east from the Playroom, they should venture north. Wait, the original instructions said after moving east, venture north. But the user is in the Playroom, which has a south exit. Maybe the user needs to go north from here. But the initial plan was to go north again. However, the user might be looping between rooms. 

Wait, the user's previous actions were: Study -> East (Cubicle) -> South (Office) -> East (Attic) -> East (Recreation Zone) -> North (Laundry Place) -> North (Playroom). Now, in the Playroom, the next step according to the original plan was to go north again. But the Playroom's north exit might lead to another room. However, the user might be stuck in a loop if they keep moving north and south. Alternatively, maybe the correct path is to go east from the Playroom to reach the cookhouse. But the original plan said after moving east from the Playroom, venture north. Wait, the original instructions said: "Once you manage that, make an attempt to go to the north. Once you've done that, make an attempt to go to the north. After that, move east. Then, venture north. Then, pick-up the coin from the floor of the cookhouse."

Hmm, maybe the user needs to go east from the Playroom to reach the cookhouse. But the Playroom has an exit to the east. So the next action should be to go east. However, the user might have already done that. Wait, the user is in the Playroom, and the previous step was moving north into the Playroom. The original plan was to move east from the Playroom. So the next action should be to go east. But the user might be in a loop if they keep moving between rooms. However, according to the game's structure, each room has specific exits.

But the instruction says after moving north, then east, then north again. Wait, the user is in the Bedroom, and the previous steps might have looped. 

The user needs to break the loop. The last action was going east, then north. Now, in the Bedroom, the exit to the north is unblocked. But maybe the user needs to go west instead of north to avoid looping. Alternatively, the cookhouse might be in the west direction. However, the original plan was to go north again. But since the user is in the Bedroom, perhaps the next step is to go west to find another path. 

Wait, the user's goal is to reach the cookhouse and pick up the coin. The current room is Bedroom. The exits are north and west. The user needs to find the correct path. Since the previous steps have been moving east and north, maybe the cookhouse is in the west direction. But the user needs to follow the original steps: after moving north, then east, then north again. But in the current room, the user is in the Bedroom. Maybe the next step is to go west to find the cookhouse. Alternatively, the user might have to go north again from the Bedroom. However, the user might be looping between rooms. 

The user's past actions include going east, south, east, north, east, north. Now in the Bedroom. The next step according to the original plan was to move east again, but that might not be correct. The user needs to check the west exit. So the next action should be west. But the user's previous actions might have led them into a loop. Therefore, the correct next step is to go west instead of north to avoid the loop and proceed towards the cookhouse.

-= Playroom =-
You find yourself in a playroom. An ordinary kind of place.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in this text-based game. The goal is to follow a specific path: go east, then south, east again, then east again, north, north again, east, north, pick up the coin in the cookhouse, and win.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Playroom again (0/9). Let me recap the steps taken so far. The initial steps were going east from the Study, then south to the Office, east to the Attic, east to the Recreation Zone, north to the Laundry Place, north to the Playroom, east to the Bedroom, west back to the Playroom. So now, they're back in the Playroom after moving west from the Bedroom.

The next step according to the original plan was to venture north from the Playroom. But the user just came from the west, so maybe they need to go north again. However, the game might have a loop here. The Playroom has exits to east and south. The previous action was west, so the next logical step would be to go north again. But the user is at 0/9, which might indicate that they haven't reached the cookhouse yet. 

Wait, the original instructions mention going north again after the previous steps. The user is in the Playroom, which has an exit to the north. So the next step should be north. But the user might be stuck in a loop between Playroom and Bedroom. However, the game's feedback says that the Playroom has an exit to the south and east. So maybe the correct next step is to go north again. But the user needs to reach the cookhouse. Alternatively, maybe the cookhouse is in a different area. 

Wait, the original plan says after moving east, north, north, east, north, then go to the cookhouse. So perhaps after the Playroom, going north would lead to the next area. But the user is at 0/9, which might mean they haven't progressed far enough. Alternatively, maybe the cookhouse is in the Laundry Place or another area. But the user hasn't picked up the coin yet. 

So the next step should be to go north from the Playroom. The user's previous action was west, so going north would be the next step. The game might not have a loop here because the Playroom has a north exit. So the correct command is "go north".

Okay, let's break this down. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in a text-based game, following a specific sequence of directions. The goal is to eventually pick up a coin in the cookhouse and win.

First, I need to recall the initial instructions: go east, then south, east again, then east again, north, north again, east, north, then pick up the coin. But the user is getting stuck in a loop between the Playroom and Bedroom.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Playroom again after trying to go north, which isn't possible. The previous steps led them back to the Playroom, so they're stuck in a loop. The key is to find a different direction instead of repeating the same actions.

In the Playroom, the available directions are east and south. The user tried north, which is blocked. So the next logical step is to go east again, which is unblocked. Even though they've been there before, the game might require moving east again to progress. Alternatively, maybe south is the way to go, but the initial plan was to go north after east. However, since north is blocked, east is the only option. So the correct next action is to go east again.

-= Bedroom =-
You have fallen into the most ordinary of all possible bedrooms. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.



There is an unblocked exit to the north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in a text-based game, following a specific sequence of directions. The goal is to eventually pick up a coin in the cookhouse and win.

First, I need to recall the initial instructions: start by going east, then south, east again, then try to go east again, then north twice, then east, north again, pick up the coin, and win. But the user has been moving through various rooms like the study, cubicle, attic, recreation zone, laundry place, playroom, and bedroom, sometimes getting stuck or looping.

Looking at the current state: the user is in the Bedroom, and the possible exits are north and west. The previous attempt to go north was blocked, so they tried east again, which brought them back to the Bedroom. Now, they need to find a way forward without looping.

The key here is to avoid repeating the same actions that lead to loops. Since going north from the Bedroom is blocked, maybe the correct path is to go west from the Bedroom. But the user has already been in the Playroom and Bedroom multiple times. The next step should be to check if there's another exit or if there's a different direction to take. However, the available exits are north and west. Since north was blocked, maybe west is the way to go, but that leads back to the Playroom. Wait, but the user needs to reach the cookhouse. Maybe the correct path is to go north from the Bedroom, but the previous attempt failed. Alternatively, perhaps there's a different route.

Wait, the initial plan was to go east, south, east, east, north, north, east, north, then pick up the coin. But the user has been moving in a loop between Playroom and Bedroom. Maybe the correct path is to go west from the Bedroom to the Playroom, then east to the Bedroom again, but that's not helping. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go north from the Playroom again, but that was blocked. Hmm.

Wait, the user is in the Bedroom, and the exit to the north is unblocked. But when they tried going north from the Playroom, it was blocked. But now, in the Bedroom, going north might be possible. Wait, the current room is Bedroom, with exit to north and west. So maybe the correct move is to go north from the Bedroom, which would take them to the next room. But earlier, when they were in the Playroom, going north was blocked. But now, in the Bedroom, going north might be possible. Let me check the previous steps.

The user's path so far: Study -> East (Cubicle) -> South (Office) -> East (Attic) -> East (Recreation Zone) -> North (Laundry Place) -> North (Playroom) -> East (Bedroom). Now, in the Bedroom, the exits are north and west. So going north from Bedroom would take them to the next room. But the user tried going north from Playroom and it was blocked, but maybe from Bedroom it's allowed. So the next step is to go north from Bedroom. But the user tried that before and got blocked? Or maybe not. Wait, in the previous step, when the user was in the Playroom, they tried going north and it was blocked. But now, in the Bedroom, going north is allowed. So the correct action is to go north from Bedroom. But the user's last action was going east, which brought them back to Bedroom. So the next step should be to go north from Bedroom. But the user is in the Bedroom, and the exit to the north is unblocked. So the next command should be "go north".

Okay, let's see. The user is playing TextWorld and needs to follow a specific sequence of steps to win. The goal is to navigate through different rooms and pick up the coin in the cookhouse.

First, I need to recall the previous steps. The user started by going east from the study, then south to the cubicle, east to the office, east again to the attic, then east to the recreation zone, north to the laundry place, north again to the playroom, east to the bedroom, west back to the playroom, then tried to go north but couldn't. Then they went east again to the bedroom again. Now they're in the cookhouse.

The next step according to the original plan was to pick up the coin from the cookhouse. The current room is the cookhouse, which has a coin on the floor. So the next action should be to pick up the coin. The user needs to collect the coin to win. Since the coin is on the floor, the command should be "take coin" or "pick up coin". But in TextWorld, the correct command is usually "take" followed by the item name. So the correct command here is "take coin".
