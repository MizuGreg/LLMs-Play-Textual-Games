THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is in a text-based game where they have to navigate through different rooms and eventually find a coin in the bathroom. The goal is to follow a specific sequence of movements: go south, east, north, then repeat some directions, and finally retrieve the coin.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Parlor again after trying to go west from the Kitchen, which wasn't possible. They tried going north again, which brings them back to the Parlor. So they're in a loop between the Kitchen and Parlor. The previous steps were: start in Recreation Zone, go south to Lounge, east to Dish-Pit, north to Cookery, north again to Washroom, west to Parlor, south back to Kitchen, then trying west which isn't possible, so they went north again to Parlor. Now they're stuck in a loop between Kitchen and Parlor.

The next step should be to break this loop. Since going west from Kitchen isn't possible, maybe they need to find another exit. But the Kitchen has an unguarded exit to the north (Parlor) and south. Wait, the user tried going south from Kitchen, which led back to Parlor. Maybe they need to go south again from Parlor? The Parlor has an unguarded exit to the south (Kitchen) and east. But going east from Parlor might lead to another room. Let me check the previous steps.

In the Parlor, the user was told to try going east or south. They tried south, which led to Kitchen. Maybe they need to go east from Parlor instead. But the user's last action was going north from Kitchen, which brought them back to Parlor. So perhaps the next move should be to go east from Parlor to avoid the loop. Alternatively, maybe there's a different path. The key is to find a way out of the loop. Since the user is stuck between Kitchen and Parlor, trying a different direction from Parlor, like east, might be necessary. So the next action should be 'go east' in the Parlor.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Kitchen and Parlor. They keep going back and forth between these two rooms. The goal is to find the coin in the bathroom and then stop. So far, they've tried various directions but ended up in the same places.

First, the goal is to follow the sequence of movements mentioned: go south, east, north, then repeat some steps, and finally get the coin. But they're stuck in a loop, so they need to break that cycle.

Looking at the current position, they're in the Kitchen again. The options are north to Parlor or south. But going west from Kitchen isn't possible. The previous actions led them back to the same rooms, so they need a different approach.

Maybe they need to find another exit or look for the coin in the Washroom. The Washroom is mentioned as a place where the coin might be. The user has been in the Washroom multiple times. Maybe they need to check there for the coin instead of moving around.

So the next step should be to check the Washroom for the coin. Since they can't go west from Kitchen, perhaps they should go south from Parlor to reach the Washroom again and look for the coin. That would break the loop and move them towards the objective.

Well I'll be, you are in a place we're calling a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.



There is an unguarded exit to the north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to navigate through the game's rooms according to the specified sequence and find the coin in the bathroom. So far, they've been stuck in a loop between the Kitchen, Parlor, and Washroom. They tried going east and west multiple times but ended up cycling between rooms.

Looking at the current position, they're in the Laundry Place again. The previous actions involved moving back and forth between the Kitchen, Bedroom, and Laundry Place. The key here is to escape the loop and find the bathroom where the coin is. Since the Laundry Place has exits to east and west, maybe trying a different direction could lead them somewhere new. But they've already tried those directions before. Wait, maybe they need to check the rooms they've already been in for the coin. The bathroom was mentioned earlier, but they might have missed it. Alternatively, perhaps the coin is in the Washroom, which they've visited multiple times. The user needs to check the Washroom again for the coin instead of continuing the loop. So the next step should be to go south from the Laundry Place to reach the Washroom and look for the coin.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Cookhouse and Cubicle, moving east and west. The goal is to find the coin in the bathroom. So far, they've tried going south but couldn't. The key is to break the loop and find the bathroom. Maybe they need to check the Cubicle for the coin since that's where they are now. The instruction says to recover the coin from the bathroom, but maybe the coin is in the Cubicle. Alternatively, they need to find another exit. Since the Cubicle has a south exit, maybe going south from there would lead to the bathroom. Let me check the previous rooms. The user was in the Cookhouse, then Cubicle, and the exit to the south is unblocked. So the next step should be to go south from the Cubicle to reach the bathroom and get the coin.

You've just walked into a bathroom.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north.

There is a coin on the floor.
