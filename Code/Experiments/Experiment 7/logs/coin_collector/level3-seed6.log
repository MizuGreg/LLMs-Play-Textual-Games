I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, make an attempt to take a trip south. With that done, make an effort to venture east. Once you get around to doing that, pick-up the coin from the floor of the sauna. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Lounge =-
You arrive in a lounge. You begin looking for stuff.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

You've just walked into a basement.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and collect a coin in a sauna to win. The current scenario is in the Basement, and they've already gone south from the Lounge. The next step mentioned was to go east in the Basement.

First, the goal is to take a trip south, then east, pick up the coin in the sauna, and win. So far, the user has gone south (from Lounge to Basement) and then east (from Basement to where? Maybe the sauna? But the next step is to pick up the coin. Wait, the user is in the Basement now. The instruction says after going east, they need to pick up the coin from the sauna. So maybe going east from the Basement leads to the sauna. But the user hasn't done that yet. The current location is the Basement, and the next action should be to go east. But the user might be in a loop if they keep going back. However, the user hasn't tried going east yet. The previous action was going south, then east. Wait, the user's last action was going east in the Basement. The next step is to pick up the coin in the sauna. So maybe after going east, they are in the sauna and can pick up the coin. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next step is to pick up the coin. But the user is in the Basement, so maybe they need to go east to reach the sauna. The user's past actions are going south and then east. Now, they need to pick up the coin. But the current location is the Basement. Wait, the initial instructions said after going south and east, pick up the coin from the sauna. So maybe after going east, they are in the sauna. So the next step is to pick up the coin. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action should be to pick up the coin. However, the user is in the Basement, so maybe they need to go east first. Wait, the user's last action was going east in the Basement. The response was "You've just walked into a basement." Then the user is told to try going east. So maybe the next step is to go east again? Wait, no. The user is in the Basement, and the next step is to go east. But the user has already done that. Wait, the initial steps were: go south (from Lounge to Basement), then go east (from Basement to maybe the sauna). Then pick up the coin. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action is to pick up the coin. But the user is in the Basement, so maybe they need to go east again? Or perhaps the sauna is in the Basement. Wait, the problem says "pick-up the coin from the floor of the sauna." So the sauna is a separate room. So the user needs to go east from the Basement to reach the sauna, then pick up the coin. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action is to go east again. But the user is already in the Basement. Wait, the user's current location is the Basement. The instruction says after going south and east, pick up the coin. So maybe going east from the Basement leads to the sauna. So the next step is to go east, then pick up the coin. But the user has already gone east once. Wait, the user's previous actions were: go south (to Basement), then go east (to where? Maybe the sauna). Then the next step is to pick up the coin. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action is to pick up the coin. But the user is in the Basement. Wait, maybe the user is in the sauna now. The initial problem says that after going east, they need to pick up the coin. So perhaps after going east, they are in the sauna. So the next action is to pick up the coin. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next step is to pick up the coin. But the user is in the Basement. Wait, maybe the user is in the Basement, and the next step is to go east to the sauna, then pick up the coin. So the next action is to go east again. But the user has already gone east once. Wait, the initial instructions said: first go south, then east. So the user has done those steps. Now, they need to pick up the coin. So the next action is to pick up the coin. But the user is in the Basement. So maybe the coin is in the sauna, which is accessible via east. So the user needs to go east to the sauna, then pick up the coin. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action is to go east again. But the user is already in the Basement. Wait, the user is in the Basement, and the next step is to go east. So the next action is to go east. Then, once in the sauna, pick up the coin. So the next action is to go east. But the user is in the Basement. So the answer is to go east again. But the user might be in a loop. Wait, the user is in the Basement, and the previous action was going east. The response was "You've just walked into a basement." Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe the user is in the Basement, and the next step is to go east. But the user is already in the Basement. Maybe the user needs to go east from the Basement to reach the sauna. So the next action is to go east. Then, once in the sauna, pick up the coin. So the next action is to go east.

-= Sauna =-
You've just sauntered into a sauna. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."



There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

There is a coin on the floor.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing a text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and collect a coin in a sauna to win. Let me break down the current situation.

First, the goal is to go south, then east, pick up the coin in the sauna, and then win. So far, the user has gone south to the basement, then east to the sauna. Now, in the sauna, they need to pick up the coin. The prompt says there's a coin on the floor. So the next step is to pick it up. The previous actions were going south and east, which are already done. The next logical step is to pick up the coin. The user hasn't done that yet, so the next command should be to take the coin. I need to make sure that the command is correct and matches the game's expected input. The answer should be "take coin" or "pick up coin". Since the game might expect a specific verb, "take" is probably better. But looking at the previous commands, the user used "go south" and "go east", so maybe "take coin" is the right command here. Let me confirm the steps again. The user is in the sauna, found the coin, so the next action is to take it. Then they win. So the next command is "take coin".
