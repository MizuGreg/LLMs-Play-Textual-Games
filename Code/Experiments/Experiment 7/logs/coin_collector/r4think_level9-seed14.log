You are now playing a profound session of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First thing I need you to do is to venture east. Then, make an attempt to travel east. With that over with, make an attempt to venture north. Then, travel east. Following that, take a trip north. Following that, make an attempt to take a trip west. With that accomplished, venture south. Then, go west. If you can succeed at that, lift the coin from the floor of the garage. Got that? Good!

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is playing a text adventure game called TextWorld. Their task is to follow a series of directions to eventually lift a coin from the garage. Let me break down the steps they need to take.

First, the initial instruction says to venture east, then attempt to travel east again. Then venture north, travel east, take a trip north, attempt to go west, venture south, go west. After that, lift the coin from the garage.

Looking at the current environment, the user is in the Workshop. The previous steps were going east from the Office to the Cellar, then east again to the Workshop. Now, in the Workshop, the description mentions that both north and west exits are unblocked. The user's next step according to the original plan is to venture north. But the user might be stuck in a loop if they keep going back and forth.

Wait, the user's goal is to reach the garage. The Workshop is part of the path. The next step after the Workshop would be to go north as per the original plan. But maybe the user is repeating actions without progress. Let me check the steps again.

Original plan: After the Workshop, the next steps are to go north, then east, then north again, then west, south, west. But in the Workshop, going north or west is possible. If the user goes north from the Workshop, they might reach another area. But if they keep going back, they might loop. However, the user's next action should be to go north as per the initial instructions. But the user might have already done that. Wait, the user's current location is the Workshop, and the next step in the original plan is to venture north. So the correct next action is to go north. But the user might have already done that. Wait, the original instructions say after the Workshop, take a trip north. So the next action is to go north. But the user is in the Workshop, so the next step is to go north. However, the user might be in a loop if they keep moving between areas. But according to the plan, they need to proceed step by step. So the next action is to go north.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in the game. Their goal is to lift the coin from the garage. So far, they've gone from the Office east to the Cellar, then east again to the Workshop. In the Workshop, they tried going north and west, but those didn't work. Then they ended up in the Canteen, where they tried going north and west again, but both are blocked.

Wait, the current room is the Canteen. The exits here are east and south. The user tried going north and west, which aren't possible. So they're stuck. The original plan was to go north from the Workshop, then east, then north again, then west, south, west. But maybe they're not following the exact steps. 

Looking at the Canteen's exits: east and south. The next step might be to go east or south. The original plan after the Workshop was to go north, but that led to the Canteen. Now, in the Canteen, the next step should be to go east or south. The user's previous actions were going north and west, which are blocked. So they need to try the available exits. The original plan might have a different path, but since they're in the Canteen, maybe the next step is to go east. But the user's goal is to reach the garage. Maybe the garage is in a different part. Alternatively, maybe they need to go south from the Canteen. But the original plan said after the Workshop, go north, then east, then north again. Maybe the user is off track. 

Wait, the user's goal is to eventually get to the garage. The current location is the Canteen. The exits are east and south. If they go east, they might reach another area. If they go south, maybe they can find the garage. But the original plan didn't mention this. So perhaps the user needs to adjust their approach. Since they're stuck in a loop of trying north and west, which aren't possible, they need to try the available exits. The next step should be to go east or south. But the original plan said after the Workshop, go north. So maybe the user needs to go east from the Canteen. Alternatively, maybe the garage is accessible from the Canteen's south exit. 

The user's past actions include going east, east, north, west, north, west. But they're stuck. The next step is to try the available exits. Since going north and west are blocked, the user must try east or south. The original plan might have a different path, but the user needs to proceed with the available options. So the next action should be to go east or south. But the user's goal is to reach the garage. Maybe the correct next step is to go south from the Canteen. But the user's original plan didn't specify that. However, since the user is stuck, they need to try the available exits. So the next action is to go south. But the user's previous attempt to go north was blocked. So the correct next step is to go south. But the user's original plan said after the Workshop, go north. Maybe they need to adjust. But according to the current situation, the next step is to go south. So the answer is to go south.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms to lift the coin from the garage. The goal is to follow a specific path: east, east, north, east, north, west, south, west. But they're getting stuck in a loop between the Workshop and Canteen.

First, the current location is the Canteen. The exits are east and south. The user tried going north and west before, which are blocked. So they need to try the available exits. Going east from the Canteen might lead them back to the Workshop, which is part of the original plan. But the user is repeating steps, so they need to find a different approach.

Looking at the steps again: after the Workshop, the plan was to go north, then east, then north again. But in the Canteen, going east leads back to the Workshop, which is where they started. So maybe the correct next step is to go south from the Canteen. That would take them to a new area, possibly closer to the garage. The user needs to avoid looping between the Workshop and Canteen by choosing the south exit instead of east. Therefore, the next action should be to go south.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Workshop and Canteen. They keep going north and south, which isn't getting them closer to the garage. The original plan was to follow specific directions: east, east, north, east, north, west, south, west. But they're not following that correctly.

First, the goal is to lift the coin from the garage. So far, they've moved around but haven't reached the garage. The current location is the Canteen, with exits east and south. The Workshop has exits north and west. The user is repeatedly moving between these two rooms, which is a loop.

The next step should be to find a different path. Since going north and west from the Workshop leads back to the Canteen, maybe they need to go east from the Canteen. But the user tried that before and ended up back in the Workshop. Wait, maybe the garage is accessible from another direction. Alternatively, perhaps the user needs to go south from the Canteen to a new area. But the original plan didn't mention that. However, since the user is stuck, they need to try a different approach.

Maybe the garage is in a different area. The user needs to continue moving in the correct direction. Since the previous steps led them here, the next step might be to go north or west. But they need to avoid loops. The user has been moving back and forth, so they need to choose a direction that leads them closer to the garage. The next action should be to go north or west, but which one? The original plan might have a specific path, but the user has deviated.

You've entered a bedroom. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.



There is an unguarded exit to the east. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Laundromat and Bedroom. They keep going north and south, which isn't getting them closer to the garage. The original plan was to follow specific directions to reach the garage. But they've deviated and are now repeating the same path.

First, the goal is to lift the coin from the garage. The user needs to find the correct path that leads to the garage. So far, they've gone through several rooms but haven't reached the garage yet.

Second, the past actions include moving east, east, north, east, north, west, south, west, and then back and forth between Laundromat and Bedroom. The next step should be to try a different direction. Since the Laundromat has an exit to the west, maybe going west from there would lead to a new area.

Third, the user is in a loop between Laundromat and Bedroom. To break the loop, they need to try the west exit from Laundromat instead of north. That might take them to a different room that's part of the original path.

Okay, so you're in a laundromat, cool, but is it usual? You better believe it is. You can barely contain your excitement.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

You have walked into the most normal of all possible parlors. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?
