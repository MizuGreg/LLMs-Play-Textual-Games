THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to proceed. The user is in a text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and find a coin in a dish-pit. The goal is to reach the dish-pit and pick up the coin.

Looking at the history, the user has been moving through various rooms: garage, studio, basement, bedchamber, sauna, spare room, attic, office, canteen, and back to the office. The last move was going north from the canteen back to the office. Now, they're in the canteen again, and the description mentions an exit to the west. 

The previous steps involved moving south multiple times, but now they're looping between the canteen and office. The user needs to find a way to break this loop. The next step should be to check the west exit in the canteen. Since going north leads back to the office, maybe the west exit is the way to go. The coin is in the dish-pit, which might be in a different area. So the next action should be to go west from the canteen.

-= Dish-Pit =-
If you're wondering why everything seems so ordinary all of a sudden, it's because you've just shown up in the dish-pit.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a coin on the floor.
