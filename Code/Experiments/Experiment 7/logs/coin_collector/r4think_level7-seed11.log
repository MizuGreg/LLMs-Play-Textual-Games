SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and eventually retrieve a coin from a workshop. The current room is the Office, and the user has already moved south, east, north, and west, following the initial instructions.

The goal is to retrieve the coin from the workshop. The user's past actions have taken them through Cookery -> Kitchen -> Sauna -> Studio -> Office. Now, in the Office, the available exits are east (unguarded) and west (unguarded). The next step according to the initial instructions was to go west again, but the user is at the Office now. Wait, the previous step was "go west" leading to the Office. Now, the user is in the Office, and the next step in the original instructions was to "take a trip west" again, but that might not be possible since the Office has a west exit. However, the user might be looping here.

Looking at the current room description: the Office has an exit to the west. The user needs to find the workshop. Maybe the workshop is in a different direction. The user needs to check if the Office has other exits. The previous steps were moving in different directions, but perhaps the next step is to go west from the Office. However, if that leads back to a previous room, it's a loop. But the user needs to proceed towards the workshop. Alternatively, maybe the coin is in the Office, but the description doesn't mention it. The user needs to check the Office's contents. Wait, the original task says to retrieve the coin from the floor of the workshop. So the user needs to find the workshop and then get the coin.

In the Office, the user might need to go east or west. The user has already gone west once, leading to the Office. Maybe the next step is to go east from the Office. The Office's east exit is unguarded. Let's check the previous steps again. The initial instructions said after going west (step 4), then go west again (step 5?), but the user is now in the Office. Maybe the next step is to go east from the Office to proceed towards the workshop. Alternatively, the user might need to go west again, but that might loop. However, the user needs to find the workshop. The correct path might be to go east from the Office. Let's check the previous rooms: the Studio had a west exit to the Office. So maybe the workshop is in the east direction from the Office. The user should go east from the Office to reach the workshop and then retrieve the coin.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Studio and Office. The goal is to retrieve the coin from the workshop. The previous steps have them moving back and forth between these rooms. The problem is that the user is repeatedly going west and east between the Office and Studio, which doesn't progress toward the workshop.

First, I need to confirm the goal again. The user needs to get to the workshop and pick up the coin. So far, they've moved south, east, north, west, east, west, east. But they haven't found the workshop yet. The current room is the Studio, which connects to the Office and the South (Kitchen). The workshop might be in a different direction, maybe north from the Studio? But the Studio's north exit was blocked earlier. Wait, the initial instructions said to go north after moving south, then east, then north again. Maybe the workshop is in a different room that's not being explored yet.

The user is in the Studio again. The Studio has a south exit to the Kitchen and a west exit to the Office. The Office has an east exit back to the Studio and a west exit. The user needs to find a path that leads to the workshop. Since the previous attempts to go west and east are looping, maybe they need to try a different direction. But the Studio's north exit was blocked. Wait, maybe the workshop is in the Kitchen? But the Kitchen's exit is south. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check the contents of the current room for the coin. The Office and Studio descriptions don't mention the coin, so perhaps the workshop is another room. The user might have missed a room. Alternatively, maybe the workshop is in the Office, and the coin is on the floor. But the user hasn't checked the Office's floor yet. Wait, the original task says to retrieve the coin from the floor of the workshop. So the user needs to find the workshop first.

The user is in the Studio. The previous steps didn't reach the workshop. Maybe the correct path is to go south from the Studio to the Kitchen, then east to the Sauna, then north to the Studio again. That doesn't help. Alternatively, maybe the workshop is in the Office, and the user needs to check there. But the Office's description doesn't mention the coin. The user might need to explore other exits. Wait, the Office has a west exit. If the user goes west from the Office, they go back to the Studio. So the loop is between Studio and Office. The user needs to find another way. Maybe the workshop is in the Kitchen, but the Kitchen's exit is south. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go north from the Studio, but that was blocked. Wait, the initial instructions said to go north after moving south. Maybe the workshop is in the north direction from the Studio. But the Studio's north exit was blocked. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go west from the Office again, but that leads back to the Studio. The user is stuck in a loop. The solution is to try a different action. Since the user is in the Studio, maybe they need to check the south exit to the Kitchen again. But the Kitchen's exit is south. Wait, the user might have missed a room. The initial steps were: south, east, north, west, east, west, east. The user is in the Studio again. The next step should be to go south to the Kitchen, then east to the Sauna, then north to the Studio, but that's looping. Alternatively, maybe the workshop is in the Sauna. But the Sauna's description doesn't mention the coin. The user needs to find the workshop. Since the user is in the Studio, maybe the correct path is to go south to the Kitchen, then east to the Sauna, then north to the Studio, then east again to the Office, then east to the Studio again. This isn't working. The user needs to break the loop by trying a different action. Maybe the user should check the current room's contents for the coin. But the Studio's description doesn't mention it. The user might need to go to the Office and check there. But the Office's description also doesn't mention the coin. The user is stuck. The next action should be to go south from the Studio to the Kitchen, even though it's a loop, but maybe that's the only way to proceed. Alternatively, the user might need to go west from the Office again, but that's the same as before. The answer is to go south from the Studio to the Kitchen.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to get the coin from the workshop. They've been moving between rooms but keep looping between the Studio, Sauna, Kitchen, and Office. The goal is to reach the workshop and retrieve the coin.

Looking at the current position: the user is in the Sauna again after moving west from the Kitchen. The previous steps have them going back and forth between these rooms without making progress toward the workshop. The problem is the loop between Sauna, Kitchen, Studio, and Office.

The user needs to break this loop. The next step should be to find a different path. Since the Sauna has a north exit that's unguarded, maybe going north from the Sauna would lead to a new room. But the user has already tried that and ended up in the Studio again. Alternatively, maybe the workshop is in a different direction. The user needs to check the current room's description for any clues. The Sauna's description mentions an unguarded north exit and an unblocked west exit. The user has already tried west, which leads back to the Kitchen. Maybe the north exit from the Sauna is the key. But the user is stuck in a loop, so they need to try a different action. Perhaps instead of going west, they should go north from the Sauna. But the user has already done that. Wait, the user is in the Sauna again, so maybe the next action is to go north again. But that's the same as before. The user needs to try a different direction. Alternatively, maybe the workshop is in the Kitchen, and the coin is there. But the user hasn't checked the Kitchen's floor. The initial task says to retrieve the coin from the workshop's floor. So the user needs to find the workshop. The correct path might be to go east from the Kitchen, but that leads back to the Sauna.

But the user needs to break the loop by trying a new direction. The next action should be to go north from the Sauna.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.
