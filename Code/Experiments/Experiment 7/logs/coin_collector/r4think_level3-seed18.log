I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! First step, venture north. And then, travel north. And then, recover the coin from the floor of the chamber. Alright, thanks!

-= Studio =-
Well, here we are in a studio.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north.

-= Workshop =-
You have come into a workshop. Not the workshop you'd expect. No, this is a workshop.



There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

There is a coin on the floor.
