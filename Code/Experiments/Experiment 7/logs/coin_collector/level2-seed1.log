Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an life changing round of TextWorld? You do! Here is your task for today. First thing I need you to do is to make an effort to move south. And then, retrieve the coin from the floor of the spare room. Alright, thanks!

-= Studio =-
You've just shown up in a studio. You start to take note of what's in the room.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

-= Spare Room =-
I am sorry to announce that you are now in the spare room. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.



There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

There is a coin on the floor.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and retrieve a coin. The current room is the Spare Room, and they've already moved south from the Studio. The goal is to get the coin from the floor of the spare room.

First, the user needs to confirm the goal: retrieve the coin. So the first step is to check if the coin is in the room. The user is already in the Spare Room, and the description mentions a coin on the floor. So the next step is to pick up the coin.

But wait, the user hasn't picked it up yet. The previous action was moving south. Now, they need to pick up the coin. The next action should be to take the coin. However, in some text games, you have to use specific commands like 'take coin' or 'get coin'. Since the user is in the Spare Room and the coin is on the floor, the correct command would be to pick it up.

But the user might have to check if there's a way to interact with the coin. The description says the coin is on the floor, so the action should be straightforward. The next step is to take the coin. Then, after picking it up, they might need to exit the room, but the exit is already unblocked to the north. So once the coin is retrieved, they can go back north to the Studio. But the main goal is to retrieve the coin, so the immediate next action is to take the coin.
