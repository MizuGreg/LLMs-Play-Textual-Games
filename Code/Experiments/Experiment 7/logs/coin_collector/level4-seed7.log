Welcome to another life changing session of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First stop, go south. Next, make an attempt to venture east. And then, try to go north. If you can get through with that, lift the coin from the floor of the parlor. That's it!

-= Washroom =-
You've just sauntered into a washroom.



You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

-= Lounge =-
Wow! You're in a lounge.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unblocked exit to the north.

Well how about that, you are in the place we're calling the dish-pit.

-= Parlor =-
You find yourself in a parlor. A typical one. You start to take note of what's in the room.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

There is a coin on the floor.
