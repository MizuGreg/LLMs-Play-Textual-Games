You are now playing a profound episode of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First of all, you could, like, make an attempt to head east. Following that, make an attempt to venture south. Then, pick up the coin from the floor of the salon. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Pantry =-
You find yourself in a pantry. A standard one.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked.

>                                                                                                                                -= Pantry =-0/1
AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go east
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Bar =-
You're now in a bar.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

-= Salon =-
This might come as a shock to you, but you've just stumbled into a salon.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked.

There is a coin on the floor.


>                                                                                                                                -= Salon =-0/3
