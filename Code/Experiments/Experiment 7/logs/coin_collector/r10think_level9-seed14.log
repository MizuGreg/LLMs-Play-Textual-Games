THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game called TextWorld, and their task is to navigate through different rooms and eventually lift a coin from the garage. The current room is a bedroom, and they've been moving around various locations like the office, cellar, workshop, canteen, chamber, parlor, and laundromat.

The user's goal is to follow a specific sequence of movements: go east, then east again, then north, then east, then north, then west, south, west. After completing these steps, they need to lift the coin in the garage. So far, they've gone through several rooms, but they might be stuck in a loop between the bedroom and laundromat. 

Looking at the last few steps, they went from the laundromat to the bedroom, then back to the laundromat again. That suggests they might be repeating the same path without making progress. The next step should be to check if there's another way out or if they need to find the garage. Since the coin is in the garage, they need to get there. The previous steps didn't mention the garage, so maybe they need to find a different path or use a synonym for a direction they've already tried. 

The key is to avoid repeating the same actions. Instead of going north again from the laundromat, maybe they should check the west exit. The laundromat has an unblocked exit to the west, which might lead them to a different room. If they go west from the laundromat, they might reach the garage where the coin is. So the next action should be to go west from the laundromat to proceed towards the garage.
