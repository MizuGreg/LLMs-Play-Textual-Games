Welcome to another exciting session of TextWorld! First, it would be great if you could head west. Then, make an attempt to take a trip north. And then, make an attempt to head east. Then, make an effort to travel north. And then, go north. If you can get through with that, recover the coin from the floor of the lounge. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Shower =-
You find yourself in a shower. An ordinary one. You begin to take stock of what's here.



There is an unguarded exit to the west.

GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Workshop =-
You are in a workshop. A normal one. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.



>                                                                                                                                -= Workshop =-0/2

-= Kitchenette =-
You find yourself in a kitchenette. A normal kind of place.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.



>                                                                                                                                -= Kitchenette =-0/3
THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out the best way to proceed here. The user is in a text-based game where they need to recover a coin from the lounge. The current location is the Kitchenette, and they have an exit to the east. The goal is to get to the lounge, find the coin, and then return.

Looking at the previous steps: they started in the Shower, went West to the Workshop, then North to the Kitchenette. Now, in the Kitchenette, the exit is to the East, and the prompt suggests going South. But the user's goal is to reach the lounge, which might be further North. However, the current location is the Kitchenette, and the exit to the East is unguarded. Maybe the next step is to go East to exit the kitchenette and proceed further. But the user needs to check if that's the right direction. Alternatively, maybe the Lounge is in the North direction from the Kitchenette. But the prompt says to go South from the Kitchenette. Wait, the user is told "You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south." So maybe the exit is South, but that might take them back. But the user's goal is to get to the lounge, which might be in a different direction. 

Wait, the initial instructions said to go West, then North, then East, then North again, then North again. But in the current step, they are in the Kitchenette. The exit to the East is unguarded. So maybe the next step is to go East, then proceed from there. But the user needs to reach the lounge. The coin is in the lounge's floor. So perhaps after exiting the kitchenette east, they can proceed to the lounge. But the user has to check the directions again. Alternatively, maybe the Lounge is North of the Kitchenette, but the prompt says to go South. Hmm.

Wait, the user's previous actions were: go west (from shower to workshop), go north (to kitchenette). Now, in the kitchenette, the exit is east. The prompt says "You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded." So maybe the user can go North from the kitchenette. But the prompt says "You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south." Wait, that's conflicting. Let me check the exact text again.

In the Kitchenette description: "There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south." So the prompt is suggesting to go South. But the user's goal is to reach the lounge. Maybe the Lounge is in the North direction. But the user is in the Kitchenette. If they go South, they might be going back to the Workshop or Shower. But the initial steps were to go West, then North. So perhaps the user is in a loop. The user needs to find a way to get to the lounge without repeating the same actions. Maybe the correct path is to go East from the Kitchenette, then proceed further. But the user needs to check the directions again. Alternatively, maybe the Lounge is in the East direction from the Kitchenette. So the next step is to go East, then proceed to the Lounge. But the user needs to confirm. The initial instructions said to go West, then North, then East, then North, then North again. So maybe after the Kitchenette, the next step is to go East, then North. But the user is at the Kitchenette, and the exit to the East is unguarded. So the next action should be to go East. Then, from there, proceed North to reach the Lounge. But the user needs to make sure that's the correct path. Alternatively, maybe the Lounge is in the North direction from the Kitchenette. But the prompt says to go South. Hmm. This is confusing. The user needs to break the loop if they are stuck. Since the previous actions didn't progress, maybe the user should try a different direction. The next step is to go East from the Kitchenette, then proceed North to reach the Lounge. So the next action is go east.
