Welcome to TextWorld! First off, venture north. And then, take a trip east. Then, move east. After that, make an effort to take a trip south. Okay, and then, pick up the coin from the floor of the laundromat. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Shower =-
You've just shown up in a shower.



There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

I am sorry to announce that you are now in the basement. You begin looking for stuff.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text-based game where they need to follow specific directions to reach the goal. The initial steps mentioned were to go north, then east, east again, south, and pick up the coin in the laundromat.

Looking at the current environment, the user is in the Basement. The previous action was "go north" which took them from the Shower to the Basement. The next steps according to the initial instructions were to go east twice, then south, and then collect the coin.

In the Basement, the available directions are east and south. The user has already gone north once. The next step should be to go east. But the user might be confused because the initial instruction said to go east twice. So after the first east, they need to go east again. Then south. Then collect the coin.

Wait, the user's last action was "go north", leading to the Basement. The current prompt says to try going east. So the next action should be "go east". Then again "go east" to complete the two easts. Then "go south". Then look for the coin in the laundromat. But the user might be stuck in a loop if they keep going back. So need to make sure each step is followed without repeating. The key is to follow the sequence: north, east, east, south, then collect the coin. The next step after north is east, so the next command should be "go east".

-= Bedroom =-
You find yourself in a bedroom. An usual kind of place.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing a text-based game where they have to follow specific movement steps and collect a coin. The goal is to navigate through different rooms, move in certain directions, and pick up the coin.

First, I need to recall the initial instructions. The user was told to go north, then east twice, then south, and finally pick up the coin in the laundromat. But the current scenario is in the Bedroom, and the previous actions were going north and then east. Wait, the user's last action was "go east" from the Basement to the Bedroom. Now, the next step according to the initial plan was to move east again. But in the Bedroom, the available directions are east and west. The user might be stuck in a loop if they keep going east and west.

Looking at the current room, the Bedroom has an exit to the east and west. The user's previous actions were: go north (from Shower to Basement), then go east (Basement to Bedroom). The next step in the original plan was to move east again. But if moving east from the Bedroom leads back to a previous room, that's a loop. However, the user's next action should be to go east again, but maybe the game is designed so that after the Bedroom, moving east leads to another room. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check if the next step is south or west.

Wait, the initial plan was after going north, then east, then east again, then south. So after the Bedroom, moving east would be the third step. But the user is in the Bedroom now. The next step should be to go east again. However, the game might have a loop here. But according to the instructions, the user should follow the steps: north, east, east, south, then collect the coin. So the next action is to go east again from the Bedroom. But the user's previous action was go east, so maybe the next step is to go east again. However, the system message says to break the loop if necessary. But if the user is following the correct path, then moving east again is the right step. Alternatively, maybe the user is in a loop between east and west. But the initial plan says to go east twice. So the next action should be east again. But the user is in the Bedroom, and the available directions are east and west. So the next step is to go east again. But the user might have already done that. Wait, the user's previous action was go east from the Basement to the Bedroom. Now, the next step is to go east again from the Bedroom. So the command should be "go east".

-= Kitchenette =-
You find yourself in a standard kind of place. That is to say, you're in a kitchenette. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?



You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text-based game where they need to follow specific movements and collect a coin. The goal is to go north, then east twice, then south, and pick up the coin in the laundromat.

Looking at the current location: the user is in the Kitchenette. The previous steps were going north to the Shower, then east to the Basement, then east again to the Bedroom, and then east again to the Kitchenette. Now, the next step according to the initial instructions was to go south from the Kitchenette. But the user hasn't done that yet. The current prompt says "You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded." So the next logical step is to go south. However, the user might be in a loop if they keep moving east and south without progress. But since the initial plan was to go south after the two easts, the next step should be south. But the user's last action was east again, leading to Kitchenette. So the next step is to go south from here. The answer should be "go south".

-= Laundromat =-
I am sorry to announce that you are now in the laundromat.



There is an unblocked exit to the north.

There is a coin on the floor.

Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is playing a text-based game where they need to follow a series of directions to reach the laundromat and pick up a coin. Let me recap the steps they've taken so far.

First, they started by going north from the shower, which took them to the basement. Then they went east to the bedroom, then east again to the kitchenette, and then south to the laundromat. Now they're in the laundromat, which is the final destination mentioned in the initial instructions. The goal was to pick up the coin from the floor here.

Looking at the current scene, the laundromat has a coin on the floor. The next step should be to pick up the coin. The user's previous actions have already followed the path: north, east, east, south. Now, the remaining task is to collect the coin. The instruction says to "pick up the coin from the floor of the laundromat" once all the previous steps are done. So the next action should be to pick up the coin. There's no loop here because they've reached the laundromat and the coin is present. The previous actions have been correctly followed without repetition, so the next command is to pick up the coin.
