Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. Your first objective is to venture east. Then, make an attempt to travel east. With that over with, make an attempt to venture north. Then, travel east. Following that, take a trip north. Following that, make an attempt to take a trip west. With that accomplished, venture south. Then, go west. If you can succeed at that, move west. After that, go north. After that, retrieve the coin from the floor of the cookery. Got that? Good!

Well, here we are in the office.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to follow a specific sequence of movements: venture east, then east again, then north, then east, north, west, south, west, north, and finally retrieve the coin from the cookery.

So far, the user has gone from the Office to the Cellar, then to the Workshop, and then to the Canteen. The current location is the Canteen. The next steps in the original plan are to go north from the Canteen, but the user's last action was "go north" which led to the Canteen. Wait, no, looking back: the user started at Office, went east to Cellar, east again to Workshop, then north to Canteen. Now, the next step in the original instructions was after arriving at the Canteen, they need to go south. But the user's next action should be to go south from the Canteen. However, the user's last action was "go north" which brought them to the Canteen. The next step according to the plan is to go south from the Canteen. But the user might be stuck in a loop if they keep going back and forth. Wait, the current location is the Canteen. The exits are east and south. The user needs to go south next. But the user's previous action was going north to get here. So the next step is to go south. But the user's next action should be "go south" to proceed. However, the user might have already done some steps. Let me check the steps again.

Original plan: After the Canteen, the next steps are to go south, then west, then north, then retrieve the coin. But the user is at the Canteen. The current step is to go south. So the next action should be "go south". But the user's last action was "go north" to get to the Canteen. So the next step is to go south. However, the user might be in a loop if they keep moving between the Canteen and other areas. But according to the plan, after the Canteen, they need to go south. So the correct next action is "go south".

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.
