It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First thing I need you to do is to go south. Next, make an attempt to venture east. And then, try to go north. If you can get through with that, attempt to travel north. Then, head west. And then, make an attempt to venture south. With that over with, move south. Then, lift the coin from the floor of the cubicle. Alright, thanks!

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in TextWorld. The goal mentioned earlier was to go south, then east, north, north again, west, south, and finally lift the coin from the cubicle. But the user is stuck in a loop between the Laundry Place and Dish-Pit.

First, I need to recap the goal. The original steps were: go south, east, north, north, west, south, then lift the coin. But the user has been moving between Laundry Place and Dish-Pit, which suggests they're going back and forth. 

Looking at the current position, the user is in the Dish-Pit again. The previous actions were go south from Laundry Place to Dish-Pit, then go south again, which loops back to Laundry Place. So the user is stuck in a cycle between these two rooms. 

The next step should be to break the loop. Instead of going south again, maybe try going west from the Dish-Pit. The instruction said to try going west if the north is unguarded. Wait, in the Dish-Pit description, it says "try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked." So maybe the user should go west instead of south. 

But the user's last action was go south again, which leads back to Laundry Place. So changing the direction to west in the Dish-Pit would take them to a different room, perhaps the Laundry Place again? Wait, the Laundry Place has an exit to the north and south. If they are in the Dish-Pit and go west, maybe that leads to another area. But the user needs to find the cubicle with the coin. 

Alternatively, maybe the correct path is to go west from the Dish-Pit. Let me check the previous steps. The user was in the Laundry Place, went south to Dish-Pit, then tried to go south again, which loops back. So instead of going south again, they should go west from Dish-Pit. That would take them to a different room, perhaps the Lounge or another area. But the user's goal is to reach the cubicle. 

Wait, the original plan was to go south, east, north, north, west, south. But the user is stuck in a loop. So maybe the correct next action is to go west from the Dish-Pit instead of south. That would break the loop. So the next command should be go west.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to navigate through the rooms as per the initial instructions: go south, east, north, north, west, south, then lift the coin. But they've been stuck in a loop between the Laundry Place and Dish-Pit.

Looking at their current position, they're in the Lounge again after going west from the Dish-Pit. The previous steps involved moving back and forth between Laundry Place and Dish-Pit, which is a loop. The next step should be to avoid repeating the same actions. Instead of going east again, which leads back to the Dish-Pit, they need to try a different direction. The Lounge has an unguarded exit to the north, so going north from the Lounge might be the way to proceed. That would take them out of the loop and towards the next part of the journey.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Bedroom, Lounge, Dish-Pit, and Laundry Place. The goal was to eventually lift the coin from the cubicle. But so far, the user has just been moving back and forth without making progress.

First, I need to recap the goal. The original steps were: go south, east, north, north, west, south, then lift the coin. But the user hasn't reached the cubicle yet. They've been looping between rooms.

Looking at the current position, the user is in the Lounge again. The previous actions have led them back to the same places. The key is to break the loop. Instead of repeating the same directions, maybe they need to find a different path. The Lounge has an exit to the east and north. Maybe going east from the Lounge would lead them to a new area where the coin is located.

Wait, the initial instructions mentioned moving east from the Lounge. But the user has been going north instead. Maybe the correct path is to go east first. Let me check the earlier steps. The user was told in the Lounge to try going east if they need an unblocked exit. So perhaps the next action should be go east to proceed further and avoid the loop.

So far, the user has just been moving back and forth without making progress. The key is to break the loop. Instead of repeating the same directions, maybe they need to find a different path. The Lounge has an exit to the east, so going east from the Lounge might be the way to proceed further and avoid the loop.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Bedroom, Lounge, Dish-Pit, and Laundry Place. The goal is to lift the coin from the cubicle. So far, the user has just been moving back and forth without making progress. The key is to break the loop. Instead of repeating the same directions, maybe they need to find a different path. The Lounge has an exit to the east, so going east from the Lounge might be the way to proceed further and avoid the loop.

FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Bedroom, Lounge, Dish-Pit, and Laundry Place. The goal is to lift the coin from the cubicle. So far, the user has just been moving back and forth without making progress. The key is to break the loop. Instead of repeating the same directions, maybe they need to find a different path. The Lounge has an exit to the east, so going east from the Lounge might be the way to proceed further and avoid the loop.

-= Lounge =-
You find yourself in a lounge. A typical one. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north.

-= Dish-Pit =-
You've just sauntered into a dish-pit.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.



>                                                                                                                                -= Dish-Pit =-0/99

-= Laundry Place =-
You've just shown up in a laundry place.



There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the south.
