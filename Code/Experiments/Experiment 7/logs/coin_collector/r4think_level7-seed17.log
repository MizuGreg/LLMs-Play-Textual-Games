It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! First of all, you could, like, make an attempt to head east. Following that, make an attempt to venture south. Then, make an effort to take a trip south. And then, make an effort to travel south. If you can manage that, attempt to go east. Then, go to the south. Following that, pick up the coin from the floor of the cookery. And once you've done that, you win!

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in TextWorld. The goal is to collect the coin in the cookery and then win. Let me recap the steps they've taken so far.

First, they started in the pantry, went east to the bar. Then from the bar, they went south to the office. From the office, they went south again to the bathroom. Now they're in the bathroom. The next step according to the initial instructions was to go south again from the bathroom, but the user might be stuck in a loop here.

Looking at the current room description: the bathroom has an unguarded exit to the south. The user's previous action was going south from the office to the bathroom. Now, they need to go south again from the bathroom. But if they keep going south, maybe they're looping between rooms. Wait, the initial plan was to go east, then south three times, then east again, then south, then pick up the coin. But maybe the path isn't straightforward.

Wait, the user is in the bathroom. The next step should be to go south again. But if that's not working, maybe they need to find another way. However, the instructions say to not repeat the same action if it's a loop. But in this case, the bathroom's south exit is unblocked. So maybe the next step is to go south again. But the user might be stuck in a loop between bathroom and another room. Alternatively, maybe the coin is in the cookery, which is part of the original path. Let me check the original plan again.

Original plan: Start in pantry, go east (bar), then south (office), south (bathroom), then south again. But maybe after the bathroom, going south leads to the cookery. Then, once there, pick up the coin. But the user hasn't reached the cookery yet. So the next step is to go south from the bathroom. But the user might have already done that. Wait, the current room is the bathroom, and the next step is to go south again. But according to the previous steps, the user went from office to bathroom (step 3), then from bathroom, go south. But the user's next action should be to go south again. However, the user might be in a loop. Alternatively, maybe the cookery is in a different direction. Wait, the initial instruction said after going south three times, then east, then south, then pick up the coin. So maybe after the bathroom, going south leads to the cookery. So the next action is go south.
