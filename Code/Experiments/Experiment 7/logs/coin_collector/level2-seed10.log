Welcome to TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First thing I need you to do is to try to venture east. Then, recover the coin from the floor of the attic. Alright, thanks!

-= Spare Room =-
Welcome to the spare room.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Attic =-
You've just shown up in an attic. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?



There is an unguarded exit to the west.

There is a coin on the floor.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in the Attic, which is part of the TextWorld game. The goal is to recover the coin from the attic's floor. The user has already moved east from the Spare Room to the Attic. Now, in the Attic, there's a coin on the floor. The next step is to pick up the coin.

Wait, the user's previous action was "go east", which led them to the Attic. Now, they need to collect the coin. The current room has the coin, so the next action should be to pick it up. But the game might require using a specific command like "take coin" or "get coin". Since the user is in the Attic and the coin is on the floor, the correct command would be to take the coin. Then, maybe they need to go back or find another exit, but the main goal is to collect the coin. So the next action is to take the coin.
