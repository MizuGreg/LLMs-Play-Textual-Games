Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First stop, try to venture east. Then, venture south. After that, try to go to the south. Once you succeed at that, try to go west. If you can finish that, try to move north. That done, make an effort to take a trip east. After that, try to take a trip south. Okay, and then, lift the coin from the floor of the cubicle. And if you do that, you're the winner!

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The user wants me to figure out the next step in the game. The goal is to lift the coin from the cubicle. So far, the player has moved through several rooms: Spare Room → Attic → Steam Room → Bedchamber → Chamber → Kitchenette → Basement. The last action was going east to the Basement.

Looking at the current room, the Basement has an exit to the west and south. The user's previous steps involved moving east, south, west, north, etc., but they haven't found the cubicle yet. The coin is in a cubicle, so I need to find that location.

In the Basement, the description mentions an exit to the west and south. Maybe the cubicle is in one of these directions. The user needs to check those exits. Since they were in the Basement and the next step was to go east (which led to the Basement), maybe the cubicle is in the south or west direction. But the user hasn't checked those yet. Wait, the user is in the Basement now. The previous steps were moving through different rooms, but the cubicle hasn't been located. The key is to find the cubicle and then pick up the coin.

So the next step would be to check the exits from the Basement. The user needs to go south or west. But the user has already gone east to get here. Maybe the cubicle is in the south or west. Let me check the previous rooms. The Bedchamber had exits to north and west. The Chamber had east and north. The Kitchenette had east and south. The Basement has west and south. So perhaps the cubicle is in the south direction from the Basement. But the user hasn't checked that yet. So the next action should be to go south from the Basement. Alternatively, maybe the cubicle is in the west. But the user needs to explore both. However, the user's previous actions have been moving east, south, west, north, etc., so maybe the cubicle is in the south direction. Let me check the game's structure again.

Wait, the user's goal is to lift the coin from the cubicle. The cubicle is likely in a specific room. The user hasn't found it yet. So the next step is to explore the Basement's exits. The user is in the Basement, so they need to go south or west. Let's check the Basement's description again: "You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked." So the user should try going south. But the user was just in the Basement, and the previous action was going east to get here. So the next step is to go south from the Basement. That would take them to the next room, maybe the south exit. Then, once they find the cubicle, they can pick up the coin. So the next action is go south.

-= Cubicle =-
You find yourself in a cubicle. An ordinary kind of place. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked.

There is a coin on the floor.
