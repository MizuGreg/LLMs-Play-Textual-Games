Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First thing I need you to do is to try to venture east. Then, venture south. After that, try to go to the south. Once you succeed at that, try to go west. If you can finish that, pick-up the coin from the floor of the chamber. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

You are in a spare room. An usual one.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked.
