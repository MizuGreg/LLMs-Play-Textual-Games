I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to head west. Then, make an attempt to take a trip north. And then, make an attempt to head east. Then, make an effort to travel north. And then, go north. If you can get through with that, make an effort to venture north. Then, move west. With that done, pick-up the coin from the floor of the lounge. And once you've done that, you win!

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to win this game. The user's goal is to pick up the coin from the lounge and then win. So far, the player has been moving between different rooms: shower, workshop, kitchenette, canteen, pantry, playroom, and bedchamber. It seems like there's a loop between the playroom and bedchamber because every time they go north from the playroom, they end up in the bedchamber, and going south from the bedchamber brings them back to the playroom.

The next step would be to find the lounge where the coin is. The instructions mentioned going west from the shower, then east from the workshop, but those paths loop back. Maybe the key is to find another exit that wasn't mentioned. In the kitchenette, there's an exit to the east (canteen) and south. The canteen has exits north and west. The pantry has north and south. The playroom and bedchamber are looping. Maybe the lounge is connected to the kitchenette or pantry. Wait, the user needs to get to the lounge. Maybe the coin is in the kitchenette or pantry? But the user hasn't checked those areas yet. Alternatively, maybe the coin is in the bedchamber or playroom. But the user hasn't picked it up yet. Wait, the original instruction said to pick up the coin from the floor of the lounge. So the lounge must be a room that hasn't been visited yet. The current location is the bedchamber. The exits from the bedchamber are south (playroom) and west. The west exit from the bedchamber might lead to another room. Wait, in the bedchamber, the user can go west. Let me check the previous steps. When in the bedchamber, the user went south to playroom, but maybe going west from the bedchamber is the way to go. The user hasn't tried that yet. So the next step should be to go west from the bedchamber to find the lounge and pick up the coin.

-= Lounge =-
You find yourself in a lounge. An ordinary one. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.



There is an unblocked exit to the east.

There is a coin on the floor.
