Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, go to the north. And then, go to the east. With that over with, retrieve the coin from the floor of the study. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Cookhouse =-
You find yourself in a cookhouse. A typical kind of place.



There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

-= Kitchenette =-
Well, here we are in a kitchenette. Let's see what's in here.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and retrieve a coin to win. The initial steps were to go north from the cookhouse to the kitchenette. Now, the current location is the kitchenette, and the user needs to proceed further.

The goal is to retrieve the coin from the study. The user has already gone north once, which took them to the kitchenette. The next step mentioned was to go east, but the prompt says there's an exit to the east, but also mentions trying south. However, the user's previous action was going north, so maybe they need to check the directions again.

Wait, the user is in the kitchenette. The description says there's an exit to the east and a south exit. The user needs to get to the study. Maybe the study is to the south? But the initial instruction said to go north first, then east. But after going north once, they're in the kitchenette. So perhaps from the kitchenette, going east would lead to another area, but the user needs to find the study. Alternatively, maybe the study is south of the kitchenette. But the user hasn't checked that yet.

The user's next step should be to go east as per the initial instruction. But the prompt says "you need an unblocked exit? You should try going south." So maybe the user is in a loop if they keep going north again. But the user has already gone north once. So the next step is to go east from the kitchenette. But the user's previous action was going north, so maybe they need to go east next. However, the user's last action was going north, so the next step is to go east. But the user is in the kitchenette, and the exit to the east is unblocked. So the next action should be go east. But the user needs to reach the study. Alternatively, maybe the study is south of the kitchenette. But the user hasn't checked that yet. However, the initial instructions said to go north first, then east. So after going north to the kitchenette, the next step is to go east. But the user is in the kitchenette, so going east would be the next step. However, the user's last action was going north, so the next step is to go east. But the user needs to retrieve the coin from the study. So perhaps after going east, they can find the study. Alternatively, maybe the study is south. But the user needs to follow the initial steps: go north, then east. So the next action is to go east from the kitchenette. But the user is in the kitchenette, so the next step is to go east. However, the user's previous action was going north, so the next step is to go east. But the user is in the kitchenette, and the exit to the east is unblocked. So the next action is go east. But the user needs to reach the study. So the correct next step is to go east. But the user might be in a loop if they keep going back. But the initial instructions say to go north, then east. So the next action is go east.

-= Study =-
You arrive in a study. An usual one.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

There is a coin on the floor.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms to retrieve a coin and win the game. The current room is the Study, and there's a coin on the floor. The previous steps were going north to the Kitchenette, then east to the Study. Now, the goal is to get the coin.

First, the goal is to go north, then east, get the coin, and win. So far, they've gone north and east, which took them to the Study. The next step should be to pick up the coin. But the instruction says to retrieve the coin from the floor of the study. So the next action should be to pick up the coin. However, in TextWorld, sometimes you need to use specific commands like 'take coin' or 'get coin'. But the user's previous actions were 'go north' and 'go east', so maybe the next step is to pick up the coin. But the system message says to output the command, so the answer should be 'take coin' or 'get coin'. Wait, the user's last action was 'go east', leading to the Study. Now, in the Study, the coin is on the floor. So the next step is to pick it up. The correct command would be 'take coin' or 'get coin'. But the user might have to use 'take' or 'get'. Let me check the previous commands. The user used 'go north' and 'go east', so the next step is to take the coin. Therefore, the next action is 'take coin'.
</think>take coin
