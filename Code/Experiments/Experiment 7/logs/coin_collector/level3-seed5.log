Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, go to the north. And then, go to the east. With that over with, retrieve the coin from the floor of the study. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Cookhouse =-
You find yourself in a cookhouse. A typical kind of place.



There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded.
