THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and find a coin in a bedroom. The main goal is to move through the rooms as instructed and then retrieve the coin.

Looking at the history, the player has been moving between the Closet, Chamber, Canteen, and back to Closet multiple times. The instructions mentioned moving west, south, east, etc., but it seems like the player is stuck in a loop between the Closet and Chamber. The game's message in the Closet keeps suggesting going east or north, but those moves just cycle back through the same rooms without progress.

The user's task is to retrieve the coin from the bedroom. So far, the player hasn't found the bedroom yet. The current location is the Closet, and the next step should be to find a way to the bedroom. Since the previous moves have been repetitive, maybe the player needs to try a different direction or look for items that can help them proceed.

Wait, the initial instructions said to move west, then south, east, east, then east again, north, west, south, west, etc. But the user is stuck in a loop. Maybe the correct path is to go east from the Chamber to reach the bedroom. The Chamber has an unguarded exit to the east, which might lead to the bedroom. Alternatively, maybe the bedroom is accessible from another direction.

The key is to break the loop. Since the player is in the Closet again, perhaps trying a different direction like south or east again, but the game is suggesting north. However, the player has already tried going east and north multiple times. Maybe the bedroom is in a different part of the map, and the player needs to find a different path.

Alternatively, maybe the player needs to look for items or use a different action, like checking the room for the coin. But the task says to retrieve the coin from the floor of the bedroom. So the player needs to get to the bedroom first.

In the current state, the player is in the Closet. The previous actions have been moving between Closet and Chamber. The next step should be to go east from the Closet to reach the Chamber again, then try going east again from the Chamber to reach the bedroom. But the game's message says that the Chamber has an unguarded exit to the east, so that's probably the way to go.

So the next action should be to go east from the Chamber to reach the bedroom and then pick up the coin. But the player is currently in the Closet, so they need to go east to the Chamber again, then east again to the bedroom. However, the user's last action was going north from the Closet, which led back to the Chamber. So the next step is to go east from the Chamber to reach the bedroom.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Closet and Chamber. The goal is to get to the bedroom and pick up the coin. So far, the player has been moving east and west repeatedly without making progress. The key is to break the loop. Since the previous actions of going east and west aren't working, maybe trying a different direction like north from the Closet. But the game messages keep suggesting east or north. Wait, the user is in the Closet again, and the message says to try going east or north. The previous attempts to go east led to the Chamber, then south back to Closet. Maybe the correct path is to go east from the Chamber to reach the bedroom. But the user is in the Closet, so they need to go east to the Chamber and then east again. However, the user has been going back and forth. The next step should be to go east from the Chamber to break the loop and reach the bedroom. But the last action was going west to the Closet. So the next command should be go east from the Chamber.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Studio, Scullery, and Cookhouse. The goal is to get to the bedroom and pick up the coin. So far, they've been moving east and west between these rooms without progress. The key is to break the loop. Since the previous actions of going east and west aren't working, maybe trying a different direction like north from the Scullery. The Scullery has an exit to the north, which might lead to the bedroom. The user needs to go north from the Scullery to reach the bedroom and pick up the coin. The last action was going west to the Studio, so the next command should be go north from the Scullery.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

-= Closet =-
You've entered a closet.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.

-= Chamber =-
This is going to sound unbelievable, but you've just entered a chamber. You begin looking for stuff.



There is an unguarded exit to the east. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.
