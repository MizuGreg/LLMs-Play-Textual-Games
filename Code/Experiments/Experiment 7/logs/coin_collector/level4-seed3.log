Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an life changing round of TextWorld? You do! First step, venture north. And then, take a trip east. Then, move east. After that, retrieve the coin from the floor of the kitchenette. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Shower =-
You find yourself in a shower. An ordinary kind of place. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.



There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Basement =-
A well framed signboard tells you that you are now in the basement. Let's see what's in here.



There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is playing a text-based game where they need to follow specific steps to win. The goal is to venture north, then east twice, get a coin from the kitchenette, and then win.

First, I need to recall the current state. The user just moved north from the shower into the basement. The basement has exits east and south. The next steps according to the initial instructions were to go east twice, then retrieve the coin. But the user is now in the basement, so maybe the next step is to go east. However, the user might be in a loop if they keep moving between rooms without progressing towards the coin.

Wait, the initial plan was: go north (done), then take a trip east (first east), then move east again (second east), then get the coin. But the user is in the basement, which has an east exit. So the next step should be to go east from the basement. But if the user keeps going east and then south, maybe they're looping. But the instructions say to go east twice. So after the first east, they'd be in another room. Then another east, then get the coin. But the user hasn't retrieved the coin yet. So the next action is to go east from the basement. But the user might have already done that. Wait, the user's last action was going north, then the current location is basement. The next step is to go east. So the next command should be "go east".

-= Bedroom =-
Well how about that, you are in the place we're calling the bedroom.



There is an unblocked exit to the east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing a text adventure game, and they need to follow specific steps to win. The goal is to venture north, then east twice, get a coin from the kitchenette, and win. 

First, the user started in the shower, went north to the basement. Then they went east to the bedroom. Now, they're in the bedroom. The next step according to the initial instructions was to move east again. But the current prompt says there's an exit to the east and a suggestion to go west. Wait, the user's previous action was "go east" from the basement to the bedroom. Now, in the bedroom, the next step should be to go east again, but the game might have a loop here.

Wait, the user's past actions are: go north (shower to basement), go east (basement to bedroom). The next step was supposed to be move east again, but maybe that's not working. The problem says to check if there's a loop. If the previous actions didn't progress, they need to try a different action, maybe using a synonym. But the current location is the bedroom. The exits are east and west. The original plan was to go east twice from the basement, but maybe the user is stuck in a loop between basement and bedroom. Wait, the initial instructions said after going north (shower to basement), then take a trip east (basement to bedroom), then move east again (from bedroom to maybe another room?), then retrieve the coin in the kitchenette.

But in the current state, the user is in the bedroom. The exit to the east is unblocked. So maybe the next step is to go east again. But the game might have a loop here. Wait, the user's previous action was "go east" from the basement to the bedroom. Now, in the bedroom, the exit to the east is there. If they go east again, perhaps they reach the kitchenette. But the problem says to retrieve the coin from the kitchenette's floor. So maybe after going east from the bedroom, they reach the kitchenette. Then, pick up the coin. But the user hasn't done that yet.

Wait, the initial instructions said: after moving east twice (from basement to bedroom, then east again?), then retrieve the coin. So maybe from the bedroom, going east leads to the kitchenette. Then, the user needs to pick up the coin. But the current prompt says "retrieve the coin from the floor of the kitchenette." So the user needs to be in the kitchenette and pick up the coin. So the next step is to go east from the bedroom to reach the kitchenette, then pick up the coin. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action should be to go east again. However, the game's current response says "You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west." Maybe there's a loop here. Wait, maybe the user is in the bedroom, and going east leads back to the basement? Or maybe the exits are different. The user needs to check if going east from the bedroom is the correct path. Alternatively, maybe the user should go west from the bedroom to return to the basement, then try another direction. But the original plan was to go east twice. So perhaps the user is stuck in a loop between basement and bedroom. Therefore, the next action should be to go west to the basement, then try another direction. But the user needs to proceed towards the kitchenette. Alternatively, maybe the user should go east again from the bedroom, even if it's a loop, but the game might have a different structure. The key is to follow the initial steps: go north, east, east, then get the coin. So the next action is to go east again from the bedroom.

-= Kitchenette =-
Ah, the kitchenette. This is some kind of kitchenette, really great normal vibes in this place, a wonderful normal atmosphere. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.



You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a coin on the floor.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing a text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and retrieve a coin to win. The goal is to follow the steps: go north, then east twice, get the coin from the kitchenette, and then win.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Kitchenette. The previous steps were: go north (Shower), then east (Basement), then east again (Bedroom), then east again (Kitchenette). Wait, but the instruction said after going north, take a trip east, then move east again. So maybe the path is correct so far.

In the Kitchenette, there's a coin on the floor. The next step according to the initial instructions is to retrieve the coin. So the next action should be to pick up the coin. The user's last action was going east, which led them to the Kitchenette. Now, they need to pick up the coin. The command should be "take coin" or "get coin". But the game might expect a specific verb. Since the coin is on the floor, "take" is likely the correct command. So the next action is to take the coin, which would complete the objective and win the game.
