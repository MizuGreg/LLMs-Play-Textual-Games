Welcome to another exciting round of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First, it would be fantastic if you could head west. Then, make an attempt to take a trip north. And then, make an attempt to head east. Then, make an effort to travel north. And then, go north. If you can get through with that, make an effort to venture north. Then, pick-up the coin from the floor of the pantry. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to navigate through the different rooms and pick up the coin in the pantry. So far, they've gone west, then north, east, north again, and then north once more, ending up in the pantry. The last room is the pantry where the coin is located.

Looking at the current room description, the pantry has an exit to the south and a coin on the floor. The user's next step should be to pick up the coin. But the instruction says to pick up the coin from the floor of the pantry. So the next action should be to take the coin. However, in TextWorld, the command might be "take coin" or "get coin". Since the user has already reached the pantry, the next logical step is to pick up the coin. There's no mention of needing to move further, so the correct action is to take the coin. No loops here because each step moves them closer to the goal. So the next command is "take coin".
