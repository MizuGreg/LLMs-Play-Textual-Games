THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Basement and Shower rooms. The goal is to retrieve the coin from the dish-pit. So far, they've been moving back and forth between north and south, which isn't getting them closer. The next step should be to check if there's a way to reach the dish-pit. Maybe they need to explore west from the Basement. Let me check the previous steps. The Basement has an exit to the west. Maybe that's the path to the dish-pit. So the next action should be to go west from the Basement.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Closet, Basement, and Bedchamber. The goal is to get the coin from the dish-pit. So far, they've been moving between these rooms without finding the coin. The next step should be to check if there's a different path or if they need to look for the dish-pit directly. Since they've been moving back and forth, they need to try a new approach, maybe looking for a different exit or item.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Closet, Basement, and Bedchamber. The goal is to get the coin from the dish-pit. So far, they've been moving back and forth without finding the coin. The next step should be to check if there's a different path or if they need to look for the dish-pit directly. Since they've been moving back and forth, they need to try a new approach, maybe looking for a different exit or item.
