It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, you could, like, head south. With that accomplished, make an attempt to travel south. And then, recover the coin from the floor of the sauna. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Basement =-
You find yourself in a basement. A normal one. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.



There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Bedchamber =-
You have moved into the most normal of all possible bedchambers.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and recover a coin from a sauna. The current room is the Bedchamber, and they need to proceed south to the next area.

First, the goal is to go south from the basement to the bedchamber, then continue south again to reach the sauna. Once there, they need to pick up the coin. The user has already moved south once from the basement to the bedchamber. Now, the next step is to go south again from the bedchamber to reach the sauna. The user might be in a loop if they keep moving south without progress, but since the bedchamber's south exit is unblocked, moving south again should lead them to the next room. The next action should be to go south again to proceed towards the sauna where the coin is located.
</think>go south

-= Sauna =-
You arrive in a sauna. A standard kind of place. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a coin on the floor.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing a text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and recover a coin in a sauna to win. Let me break down the current situation.

First, the goal is to go south from the basement, then travel south again to reach the sauna, and then pick up the coin there. The user has already moved south twice: first from the basement to the bedchamber, then from the bedchamber to the sauna. Now they're in the sauna, which is the third step. The next step is to pick up the coin on the floor. 

Looking at the previous actions, the user went south twice. The current room is the sauna, and the coin is present. The next logical step is to pick up the coin. The command should be "take coin" or "pick up coin". Since the game might expect a specific verb, "take" is more likely. But the user needs to check if that's the correct action. The previous steps were moving south, so now the action is to interact with the coin. The answer should be "take coin".
</think>take coin
