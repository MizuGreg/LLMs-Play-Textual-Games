Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First, it would be great if you could go to the west. Then, make an attempt to move west. Next, venture west. And then, recover the coin from the floor of the workshop. Got that? Good!

-= Vault =-
You arrive in a vault. A typical one. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."



There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

-= Cookhouse =-
You're now in a cookhouse.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

-= Closet =-
You are in a closet. A standard one. The room is well lit.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

-= Workshop =-
Welcome to the workshop. Let's see what's in here.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

There is a coin on the floor.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to recover the coin from the workshop floor. So far, they've moved west three times, ending up in the workshop. The workshop has an exit to the east and a coin on the floor. The next step should be to pick up the coin.

Wait, the previous actions were going west each time. But after three wests, they're in the workshop. The coin is there. So the next action should be to pick up the coin. But the user might be in a loop if they keep going west again. But the workshop is the fourth room, so going west from there would be a loop. But the exit is east, so maybe they can go back east, but that's not necessary. The coin is in the workshop, so the correct action is to take the coin. But the command might be "take coin" or "pick up coin". The user needs to do that.
