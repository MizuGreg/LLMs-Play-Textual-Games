Welcome to another life changing episode of TextWorld! First of all, you could, like, go to the north. And then, go to the east. With that over with, try to head south. After that, make an effort to head east. And then, pick-up the coin from the floor of the cookhouse. Got that? Good!

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is in a text-based game where they've been moving between rooms: bedroom, kitchenette, study, and back and forth. The goal mentioned earlier was to pick up a coin from the cookhouse floor. But so far, the user has been moving east and west between the kitchenette and study, getting stuck in a loop.

First, I need to recall the original instructions. The user was told to go north, then east, then south, east again, and pick up the coin in the cookhouse. But the current room is the kitchenette, and the exits are east and south. The study is being revisited repeatedly, which suggests a loop.

Looking at the steps taken: the user started in the bedroom, went north to kitchenette, then east to study, then west back to kitchenette, and so on. This back-and-forth movement isn't progressing toward the cookhouse. The cookhouse isn't mentioned in the current rooms, so maybe the user hasn't found the right path yet.

The next step should be to check if there's a way to reach the cookhouse. The original plan was to go north, east, south, east, then pick up the coin. But perhaps the cookhouse is in a different direction. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go south from the study to reach the cookhouse. But in the study, the exit to the south is unguarded, so that's possible.

Wait, in the study, the user is told there's an exit to the south. If they go south from the study, they might reach the cookhouse. But the user has been going west and east instead. So maybe the correct path is to go south from the study once. But the user has been looping between kitchenette and study. So the next action should be to go south from the study to reach the cookhouse and pick up the coin.

But the user is currently in the study again, so the next step is to go south. However, the previous actions were going west and east, which might be the issue. The user needs to break the loop by choosing a different direction. Since the study has a south exit, that's the key. So the next command should be to go south.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text adventure game and needs to find a coin in the cookhouse. The previous attempts involved looping between the kitchenette and study by going east and west. The user tried going south from the study, which led them to the chamber. Now, in the chamber, there's an exit to the east and a suggestion to go north.

First, the goal is to pick up the coin from the cookhouse. The user has been moving between rooms without progressing toward the cookhouse. The current location is the chamber, and the exits are east and north. The previous actions were looping between kitchenette and study, so the user needs to break that loop.

The next step should be to check if the chamber has the cookhouse or the coin. Since the user is in the chamber, maybe going east from here could lead to the cookhouse. Alternatively, going north might take them back to the study, which isn't helpful. But the chamber's description mentions "looking" around, so perhaps the coin is here or in the east exit.

Since the user is in the chamber and the exit to the east is unblocked, the next action should be to go east to check if the cookhouse is there. If that's not working, maybe go north, but the user needs to avoid looping. The key is to move in a direction that hasn't been tried recently. The previous steps were west and east, so maybe east is the way to go now.
