Welcome to TextWorld! Here is how to play! Your first objective is to make an attempt to venture west. With that done, head south. And then, go east. And then, make an attempt to venture east. If you can do that, attempt to move east. After that, try to go to the north. Okay, and then, head west. Then, attempt to head south. Following that, try to venture south. After that, take a trip west. Okay, and then, make an effort to venture south. And then, make an effort to move south. Once you get around to doing that, pick-up the coin from the floor of the kitchen. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text adventure game and needs to follow specific steps to reach the goal. The goal is to venture west, then south, east, east again, north, west, south, west again, south, and finally pick up the coin in the kitchen.

Looking at the current location, the user is in the Pantry. The previous steps have them moving through various rooms: Steam Room → Studio → Dish-Pit → Cubicle → Kitchenette → Pantry. The next step according to the initial instructions was to go east from the Pantry, but the user is now in the Pantry, and the available exits are north and west. 

Wait, the user's last action was "go east" from the Kitchenette, which led them to the Pantry. Now, in the Pantry, the exits are north and west. The next step in the original plan was to go north from the Pantry. But the user needs to continue following the sequence: after the Pantry, the next step was to go north (as per the instruction: "You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unblocked exit to the west.").

But the user's goal is to eventually get to the kitchen and pick up the coin. The current path might be looping. Let me check the steps again. The original plan was: venture west, south, east, east, north, west, south, west, south, then get the coin. But the user has already done some of these steps. Now, in the Pantry, going north would take them to the next room. However, the user might be stuck in a loop if they keep moving between rooms without progressing towards the kitchen.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west from the Pantry. The instruction says there's an unblocked exit to the west. If they go west from the Pantry, they might reach the Kitchenette again, but that's where they were before. But the coin is in the kitchen, so perhaps they need to go east from the Pantry to reach the kitchen again. Wait, the user was in the Pantry, and the exit to the east would take them back to the Kitchenette. But the coin is in the kitchen, so maybe they need to go east from the Pantry to get back to the Kitchenette, then look for the coin.

But the user's last action was going east from the Kitchenette to the Pantry. Now, in the Pantry, the exits are north and west. The original plan said after the Pantry, go north. But if that leads to a loop, maybe the user needs to try a different direction. However, the instruction says to not repeat the same action if it's not working. So if going north from the Pantry is part of the original plan, but it's leading them in a loop, they might need to try west instead. But the user needs to follow the steps as per the initial instructions. Let me check the original steps again.

Original steps: After the Pantry, the next step was to go north. But if that's leading them in a loop, maybe they need to go west. However, the user's goal is to eventually get to the kitchen and pick up the coin. So perhaps the correct next step is to go north from the Pantry, which would take them to the next room, and then proceed accordingly. But the user might be stuck in a loop between the Pantry and Kitchenette. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west from the Pantry to reach the Kitchenette again, then look for the coin. But the coin is in the kitchen, so maybe they need to go east from the Pantry to get back to the Kitchenette. Wait, the user is in the Pantry, and the exit to the east is unblocked. So going east from the Pantry would take them back to the Kitchenette. Then, in the Kitchenette, they can look for the coin. But the user hasn't picked up the coin yet. So the next step is to go east from the Pantry to reach the Kitchenette again, then look for the coin. But the user's last action was going east from the Kitchenette to the Pantry, so now they need to go back east from the Pantry to get to the Kitchenette again. However, the user's current position is the Pantry, and the exit to the east is unblocked. So the next action should be to go east, which would take them back to the Kitchenette. Then, in the Kitchenette, they can look for the coin. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the correct next step is to go east from the Pantry to reach the Kitchenette again, then pick up the coin. But the user's current step is in the Pantry, so the next action is to go east.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Pantry and Canteen. They keep going back and forth between the two rooms. The goal is to eventually get to the kitchen and pick up the coin. But so far, the user has been moving between Pantry and Canteen without making progress towards the kitchen.

First, I need to recall the original steps. The initial instructions said to venture west, then south, east, east, north, west, south, west, south, and then get the coin in the kitchen. But the user has been going north and south between Pantry and Canteen, which might not be part of the original path.

Looking at the current position, the user is in the Pantry again. The exits are north and west. The original plan after the Pantry was to go north, but that's leading to the loop. Maybe the user needs to go west from the Pantry instead. The west exit from the Pantry leads to the Kitchenette, which is where the coin is. But the user hasn't been there yet. Wait, earlier the user was in the Kitchenette, then went east to the Pantry. Now, if they go west from the Pantry, they should return to the Kitchenette. Then, they can look for the coin there.

But the user's last action was going north from the Pantry, which took them to the Canteen. Then going south back to Pantry. So the loop is between Pantry and Canteen. To break the loop, the user should try a different direction. Instead of going north or south, they should go west from the Pantry to reach the Kitchenette. That's the key. The user needs to go west from the Pantry to get back to the Kitchenette where the coin is. So the next action should be "go west" instead of continuing to go north and south.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text adventure game and needs to follow specific steps to reach the goal. The goal is to venture west, then south, east, east again, north, west, south, west again, south, and then pick up the coin in the kitchen.

Looking at the current position, the user is in the Cubicle. The exits are east and west. The previous steps have them moving between the Pantry, Canteen, Kitchenette, and Cubicle, creating a loop. The user hasn't picked up the coin yet, which is in the kitchenette.

The user's last action was going west from the Kitchenette to the Cubicle. Now, in the Cubicle, they can try going east to return to the Kitchenette. But since they've been looping between these rooms, they need to find a way to get to the kitchen where the coin is. The key is to go east from the Cubicle to the Kitchenette again, then look for the coin. However, the user might be stuck in the loop between Cubicle and Kitchenette. So the next step should be to go east from the Cubicle to reach the Kitchenette once more, then check for the coin.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Kitchenette, Cubicle, Pantry, and Canteen. They keep moving back and forth without making progress towards the coin in the kitchen. The goal is to pick up the coin from the kitchen floor.

First, I need to recall the original steps. The user was supposed to venture west, then south, east, east, north, west, south, west, south, and then get the coin. But they've been looping between rooms instead of reaching the kitchen.

Looking at the current position, the user is in the Cubicle. The exits are east and west. The previous actions have them moving east and west repeatedly, which is the loop. To break the loop, they need to find a way to get to the kitchen where the coin is. The Kitchenette is nearby, but they keep moving away.

The user needs to go east from the Cubicle to reach the Kitchenette again. Once there, they can look for the coin. But since they've been looping, they need to try a different approach. Maybe they should go west from the Cubicle to get back to the Kitchenette. Wait, the exits from the Cubicle are east and west. Going west from the Cubicle would take them to the Kitchenette. Then, from the Kitchenette, they can go east or west. But the coin is in the kitchen, so maybe they need to go east from the Kitchenette to the Pantry again? No, that's not right. The coin is in the Kitchenette. Wait, the user hasn't picked it up yet. So maybe they just need to look around in the Kitchenette for the coin. But the game might require them to move to the kitchen area. However, the user is already in the Kitchenette. Maybe they need to check the floor for the coin. But the game's prompt says to pick up the coin from the floor of the kitchen. So perhaps the user needs to take the coin from the Kitchenette. But the current room is the Kitchenette, so they should be able to pick it up now. However, the user hasn't done that yet. So the next step is to pick up the coin. But the available commands don't include picking up items unless they are on the floor. The user needs to take the coin from the floor. So the correct action is to take the coin from the floor. But the game might require them to be in the correct room. Since they are in the Kitchenette, which is the kitchen, they can take the coin. So the next action should be to take the coin.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Kitchenette, Cubicle, Pantry, and Canteen. They keep moving back and forth without making progress towards the coin in the kitchen. The goal is to pick up the coin from the floor of the kitchen.

First, I need to recall the original steps. The user was supposed to venture west, then south, east, east again, north, west, south, west again, south, and then get the coin. But they've been looping between rooms instead of reaching the kitchen.

Looking at the current position, the user is in the Kitchenette. The exits are east and west. The previous actions have them moving east and west repeatedly, which is the loop. To break the loop, they need to find a way to get to the kitchen where the coin is. The Kitchenette is the kitchen, so they should be able to pick up the coin here. But the user hasn't done that yet. The game's prompt says to pick up the coin from the floor of the kitchen, which is the Kitchenette. So the next step is to take the coin from the floor. However, the user tried that earlier and couldn't see it. Maybe they need to look around more carefully. But the available commands don't include looking again unless they use the 'look' command. Alternatively, maybe they need to go to the kitchen area again. But they are already in the Kitchenette. So the correct action is to take the coin from the floor.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.
