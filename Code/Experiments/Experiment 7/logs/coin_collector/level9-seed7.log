You are now playing a life changing round of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First, it would be a great idea if you could go south. Next, make an attempt to venture east. And then, try to go north. If you can get through with that, attempt to travel north. Then, head west. And then, make an attempt to venture south. With that over with, move south. Then, try to go to the west. With that over with, recover the coin from the floor of the laundry place. Alright, thanks!

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in a text-based game. The goal mentioned earlier was to recover the coin from the laundry place. Let me recap the steps they've taken so far.

Starting in the Cookhouse, they went south to the Lounge, then east to the Dish-Pit. From there, they went north to the Cubicle, then north again to the Washroom. They tried going south back to the Cubicle and then west, but that wasn't allowed. Now they're back in the Dish-Pit again.

Hmm, the user is stuck in a loop between the Dish-Pit and Cubicle. The previous actions of going north and south aren't making progress. The next step should be to find another way out of the Dish-Pit. The instruction said to try going west from the Dish-Pit, but that led to a dead end. Wait, maybe they need to go north again from the Dish-Pit? But the exit is already north. Or perhaps there's another path they haven't tried yet.

Wait, the user is in the Dish-Pit again. The exit to the north is unblocked, but they tried going west and it wasn't possible. Maybe they need to go north again to the Cubicle, then find another exit. But the Cubicle has an exit to the south and north. They tried going west from the Cubicle, which was blocked. Maybe they need to go north again from the Cubicle to the Washroom, then find a way east or something else.

Alternatively, maybe the coin is in the Washroom or another room. The user needs to check all possible exits. Since they're stuck in a loop, they need to try a different action. Instead of going west, maybe they should go north again from the Dish-Pit. Wait, but the exit is already north. Maybe there's a different path. Or perhaps the coin is in the Washroom, and they need to explore that area more.

The key is to break the loop. Since going west from the Dish-Pit isn't working, maybe they should go north again to the Cubicle, then try a different direction. But the Cubicle's west exit is blocked. So perhaps the next step is to go north from the Cubicle to the Washroom again, then check the exits there. The Washroom has exits to the south and west. Maybe going west from the Washroom leads to another area. But the user tried that and got stuck.

Wait, maybe the user needs to go east from the Washroom? But the Washroom's exits are south and west. Oh, maybe the user needs to go east from the Washroom, but that's not an option. Alternatively, maybe the coin is in the Dish-Pit, and they need to check there. But the user hasn't found it yet. The instruction said to recover the coin from the laundry place, which might be in the Dish-Pit. So perhaps they need to look around the Dish-Pit for the coin. But the user hasn't checked that yet. So the next action should be to look for the coin in the Dish-Pit.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is stuck in a loop between the Cookhouse, Lounge, Dish-Pit, and Cubicle. The goal is to recover the coin from the laundry place. So far, the user has been moving back and forth between these rooms without making progress. The key is to find a way to get to the laundry place without getting stuck in the loop.

Looking at the previous steps, the user tried going east from the Lounge, which led back to the Dish-Pit. Then trying to go west from the Dish-Pit led back to the Lounge. This loop suggests that the user is stuck between these rooms. The next step should be to find a different path that leads to the laundry place. Maybe the coin is in one of these rooms, and the user needs to check there. Alternatively, there might be an exit that was missed. Since the user can't go west from the Dish-Pit, perhaps they need to go north again to the Cubicle and then find another exit. But the Cubicle only has exits to the north and south. Wait, the user tried going south from the Cubicle to the Dish-Pit again. Maybe the answer is to check the rooms for the coin instead of moving around. The user needs to look for the coin in the current room or nearby. Since the Laundry place is mentioned, maybe the coin is in the Washroom or another room. But the user hasn't checked those yet. The next action should be to look for the coin in the current room, which is the Dish-Pit. So the command would be to check the floor or look around.

THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Cookhouse, Lounge, Dish-Pit, and Cubicle. The goal is to recover the coin from the laundry place. So far, the user has been moving back and forth without finding the coin. The key is to break the loop and find the coin.

First, the goal is to find the coin in the laundry place. The user has been moving through rooms but hasn't checked the Laundry place yet. The previous steps show that the user is looping between rooms, so they need to find a different approach.

Second, the user's past actions involve moving east, west, north, and south repeatedly, which is causing the loop. The next step should be to check the current room for the coin. However, the user tried looking around and didn't find it. Maybe the coin is in a different room that's part of the laundry place.

Third, the user is stuck in a loop, so they need to try a different action. Instead of moving, they should look for the coin in the current room or check the Laundry place directly. Since the user can't find it by moving, the next action should be to check the Laundry place, perhaps by going north from the Dish-Pit or another exit.

Finally, the next command should be to go north from the Dish-Pit to the Laundry place. But since the user is in the Dish-Pit, the exit to the north is unblocked. So the correct action is to go north to the Laundry place and check there for the coin.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to find the coin in the laundry place but keeps looping between rooms. The goal is to recover the coin from the laundry place. So far, they've moved through several rooms like the Cookhouse, Lounge, Dish-Pit, Cubicle, Washroom, Parlor, and Recreation Zone. They've been going back and forth between these areas without finding the coin.

First, the goal is to find the coin in the laundry place. The user hasn't directly checked the laundry place yet. They've been moving around instead of looking for the coin in the current room.

Second, the past actions show that the user is stuck in a loop between the Parlor, Washroom, and Recreation Zone. They keep going east, west, north, and south without making progress. The next step should be to check the current room for the coin, but they've already tried that and didn't find it.

Third, the user is in a loop, so they need to break it. Instead of moving again, they should look for the coin in the current room or check the Laundry place directly. Since the Laundry place is mentioned, maybe the coin is in the Washroom or another room. The next action should be to go to the Laundry place, which might be the Washroom or another exit. But the user is in the Parlor now, so they need to find the exit to the Laundry place.

Finally, the next command should be to go south from the Parlor to the Recreation Zone, then find the exit to the Laundry place. But since the user is in the Parlor, the exit to the south is unguarded. So the correct action is to go south to the Recreation Zone and then check for the Laundry place exit.
