Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an profound round of TextWorld? You do! First of all, make an effort to head west. With that done, move south. And then, head east. And then, move east. Next, recover the coin from the floor of the bar. Alright, thanks!

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing a text-based game and has encountered a loop. They need to figure out the next step to progress.

First, the goal is to reach the bar and recover the coin. The user has been moving west and east between the laundromat and chamber. The previous actions were go west, then east, then west again, leading back to the same places. 

So, the user is stuck in a loop between the laundromat and chamber. The next step should be to find a different path. The chamber has an exit to the south, which was mentioned as unguarded. Maybe going south from the chamber would be the way to go instead of repeating east-west movements.

The user needs to try moving south from the chamber to break the loop and proceed further. That's the next logical step.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in a text adventure game. Their goal is to recover the coin from the bar. So far, they've moved between the laundromat, chamber, closet, and canteen. The current room is the canteen, where there's an unguarded exit to the west.

First, the goal is to reach the bar and get the coin. The user has already moved through several rooms, but they haven't found the bar yet. The next step would be to check if the canteen has any items or clues that lead closer to the bar. However, the user's previous actions have been moving between rooms without staying in one long enough to explore.

The user is in the canteen, and the exit to the west is unguarded. The previous action was going east from the closet, which led to the canteen. Now, the next logical step is to go west from the canteen. But the user might be repeating the same pattern of moving east and west, which could be a loop. However, in the canteen, the west exit is available, so maybe that's a new direction. The user needs to check if going west from the canteen leads them closer to the bar. Since the previous steps didn't find the bar, the next action should be to go west.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Closet and Canteen. They keep going east and west, which isn't getting them closer to the bar where the coin is. The goal is to recover the coin from the bar, so they need to find a way to get there.

Looking at the previous steps, the user has been moving back and forth between the Closet and Canteen. The Closet has an exit to the north, which hasn't been explored yet. Maybe the north exit leads to a different room that's part of the path to the bar. The Canteen has an exit to the west, but that's where they came from. 

Since the user is repeating the same actions without progress, they need to try a different direction. The Closet's north exit is unblocked, so going north might be the key. That's a new action that hasn't been taken yet, so it's a good candidate to break the loop. The next step should be to go north from the Closet.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Laundromat and Chamber. They keep going west and east, which isn't getting them closer to the bar where the coin is. The goal is to recover the coin from the bar, so they need to find a way to get there.

Looking at the previous steps, the user has been moving back and forth between the Closet, Canteen, and then back to the Chamber and Laundromat. The key is to break the loop. The user tried going north from the Closet earlier, but that led back to the Chamber. Now, they're stuck in a cycle between Laundromat and Chamber.

The next step should be to try a different direction. In the Chamber, there's an exit to the south. Maybe going south from the Chamber would lead to a new room that's part of the path to the bar. The user has been going east and west, but the south exit hasn't been explored yet. So, the next action should be to go south from the Chamber.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

You've entered a chamber.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Well, here we are in the closet. You begin looking for stuff.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.
