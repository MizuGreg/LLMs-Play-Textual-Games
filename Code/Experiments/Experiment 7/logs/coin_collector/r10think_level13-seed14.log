THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Laundromat and Garage. The goal is to recover the coin from the workshop. The previous steps involved moving east and west repeatedly between these two rooms. The user needs to break the loop.

First, I need to check if there's another exit or a different path. The current description says the Laundromat has an exit to the south and west, and the Garage has east and south. Maybe the south exit leads to another area. But the user has been going back and forth between east and west, so perhaps they need to go south from the Laundromat. Wait, the user just tried going west again, which loops back. The next step should be to go south from the Laundromat. But the user's last action was go west, leading back to the Garage. So maybe the correct next step is to go south from the Laundromat instead of west. That would take them out of the loop. Let me confirm: in the Laundromat, the exit to the south is unguarded. So going south would be the way to proceed. The user needs to go south instead of west to break the loop.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to recover the coin from the workshop. So far, they've been moving between the Laundromat and Garage, going east and west, which is causing a loop. The last few steps show them oscillating between the Laundromat and Garage, which isn't getting them closer to the workshop.

Looking at the current position, they're in the Canteen again. The exits here are north and west. The user tried going west before, which led them back to the Cellar. But the key is to find a way out of this loop. Maybe they need to go north from the Canteen instead of west. The north exit is unguarded, so that might be a path forward. 

Wait, in the previous steps, going north from the Canteen led them to the Bedroom, then south back to Canteen. But maybe there's another path from the Bedroom. The Bedroom has an exit to the east and south. If they go east from the Bedroom, they might reach the Parlor again. But the Parlor's exit is north and west. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the workshop is in a different area. The user needs to find a way to get out of the loop and proceed towards the workshop. Since the Coin is in the workshop, they need to reach there. The current loop is between Canteen, Cellar, Laundromat, Garage. Maybe the correct path is to go north from the Canteen once more, but that's been tried. Wait, maybe the user needs to go west from the Canteen instead of north. The west exit is unblocked. But that led to the Cellar again. 

Wait, the user's last action was going north from the Canteen, which took them to the Bedroom. Then they went south back to Canteen. So repeating north and south is not helping. The problem is the loop between Canteen and Bedroom. To break this, maybe they need to go east from the Bedroom. The Bedroom has an exit to the east. Going east from Bedroom leads to Parlor. Then from Parlor, go north to the Laundromat, then east to Garage, then south to Laundromat again. But that's the same loop.

Alternatively, maybe the workshop is in the Office. The initial step was to go east from the Office. But the user hasn't been there since the beginning. Wait, the first step was to go east from the Office, then the user went east again, but maybe they need to go back. But the user is currently in the Canteen. Maybe the correct path is to go north from the Canteen to the Bedroom, then east to the Parlor, then north to Laundromat, then east to Garage, then south to Laundromat, then west to Garage again. No, that's not helping.

Wait, the user needs to find the workshop. The Coin is in the workshop. Maybe the workshop is in the Garage? Or another room. The user needs to find a way to get out of the loop and reach the workshop. The key is to find a different path. Since the user is in the Canteen, maybe they should go west instead of north. But that leads to the Cellar. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east from the Canteen to the Parlor, then north to Laundromat, then east to Garage, then south to Laundromat again. Still looping.

Wait, the user's previous steps showed that going east from the Garage leads back to Laundromat. So maybe the correct path is to go south from the Laundromat once, but the user was stuck in the loop. The user needs to find a way to get to the workshop. Maybe the workshop is in the Office, and the user needs to go back to the Office. But how?

The initial steps started in the Office, then went east to Cellar, then east again to Canteen, then north to Bedroom, then east to Parlor, then north to Laundromat, then west to Garage, then east back to Laundromat, and so on. The user needs to find a way to get back to the Office. The Office has an unguarded exit to the east, but the user is currently in the Canteen. So maybe the correct path is to go north from the Canteen to the Bedroom, then east to Parlor, then north to Laundromat, then east to Garage, then south to Laundromat, then west to Garage again. No, that's not working.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west from the Canteen to the Cellar, then east to Canteen again. But that's the same loop. The user is stuck in a cycle between Canteen, Cellar, Laundromat, Garage, Bedroom, Parlor. The only way out is to find a different exit. The user needs to find the workshop, which is probably in a different area. Maybe the workshop is in the Office, and the user needs to go back. But how?

Wait, the user's first step was to go east from the Office. Then they went east again, but maybe they need to go back. But the Office's exit is east, so going west from the Office would lead back. But the user is currently in the Canteen. The only way to get back to the Office is to go through the Laundromat, then east to Garage, then north to Laundromat, then east to Garage again. No, that's not helpful.

Maybe the user needs to go north from the Canteen to the Bedroom, then east to Parlor, then north to Laundromat, then east to Garage, then south to Laundromat, then west to Garage again. Still looping. The user is stuck in a loop and needs to find a different path. The key is to break the loop by trying a different action. Since the user has been going back and forth between Canteen and Bedroom, maybe they need to go east from the Bedroom instead of south. That would take them to the Parlor, then north to Laundromat, then east to Garage, then south to Laundromat again. Still looping.

Wait, the user needs to recover the coin from the workshop. The workshop is probably in a different room. The user needs to find the workshop. Maybe the workshop is in the Garage. The user is in the Garage, but they can't get out. Alternatively, the workshop is in the Office. The user needs to go back to the Office. But how? The user is in the Canteen. The only way is to go north to the Bedroom, then east to Parlor, then north to Laundromat, then east to Garage, then south to Laundromat, then west to Garage again. No progress.

The user is stuck in a loop. The correct action is to go north from the Canteen, but that's been tried. Alternatively, go west from the Canteen to the Cellar, then east to Canteen again. Still looping. The user needs to find a different path. Maybe the answer is to go north from the Canteen again, but that's the same as before. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west from the Canteen, then east to the Cellar, then east to Canteen again. No progress.

Wait, the user's last action was going north from the Canteen to the Bedroom. Then they went south back to Canteen. So the next step is to go east from the Bedroom. That would take them to the Parlor. Then from Parlor, go north to Laundromat, then east to Garage, then south to Laundromat again. Still looping. The user needs to find a way to get to the workshop. Maybe the workshop is in the Garage, and the user needs to check there. But the user can't get out of the loop. The correct action is to go east from the Bedroom to the Parlor, then north to Laundromat, then east to Garage, then south to Laundromat, then west to Garage again. No progress. The user is stuck. The answer must be to go north from the Canteen again, but that's the same as before. Maybe the user needs to go west from the Canteen to the Cellar, then east to Canteen again. Still looping.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to recover the coin from the workshop. They've been moving between several rooms: Office, Cellar, Canteen, Bedroom, Parlor, Laundromat, Garage. They're stuck in a loop between these rooms, going back and forth between Laundromat and Garage, then Parlor and Bedroom, etc.

First, the goal is to get to the workshop and retrieve the coin. So far, the user hasn't reached the workshop yet. They've been moving around without finding a way out of the loop. The key is to break the loop and find a path that leads to the workshop.

Looking at the current position, the user is in the Bedroom. The exits are east and south. Previously, going east led to the Parlor, then north to Laundromat, then west to Garage, and back. Going south from the Bedroom would take them back to the Canteen. But the user has been going through the same paths repeatedly.

The problem is the loop between the Laundromat and Garage. The user needs to find another exit or a different path. Maybe they need to go north from the Parlor again, but that's been tried. Alternatively, maybe there's a different exit in the Bedroom that hasn't been explored. Wait, the Bedroom has an exit to the east and south. The user tried east, which led to the loop. Maybe they should go south from the Bedroom to the Canteen, then west to the Cellar, then east to the Canteen again. But that's the same loop.

Alternatively, maybe the workshop is in the Office, and the user needs to go back. The initial step was to go east from the Office, but the user hasn't returned yet. However, the user is currently in the Bedroom, so going west would take them back to the Parlor, then north to Laundromat, then east to Garage, then south to Laundromat again. Still looping.

The user needs to find a way to get out of the loop. Since the previous actions of going east and west aren't working, maybe they need to try a different direction. But in the current room (Bedroom), the only exits are east and south. Going south leads to Canteen, which is part of the loop. Going east leads to Parlor, which is also part of the loop. So the user is stuck.

The answer is to go south from the Bedroom to the Canteen, then west to the Cellar, then east to the Canteen again. But that's the same loop. The user needs to find a different path. Maybe the workshop is in the Garage, and the user needs to check there. But the user can't get out of the loop. The correct action is to go south from the Bedroom, but that's already been tried. The user is stuck in a loop and needs to break it by trying a different action. The next step is to go south from the Bedroom.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Parlor, Bedroom, Canteen, and Cellar. The goal is to recover the coin from the workshop. So far, they've been moving east and west without making progress. The key is to break the loop and find a new path.

First, the goal is to reach the workshop and get the coin. The user has been going in circles, so they need to find a different direction. The current room is the Parlor, with exits to north and west. The previous actions were going west to the Bedroom, then south to the Canteen, then west to the Cellar, then east back to the Canteen. That's the loop.

Second, the past actions have not led to any new areas. The user needs to try a different exit. Instead of going west, maybe go north from the Parlor. The north exit is unguarded, so that might be a way out of the loop.

Third, the loop is between the Parlor, Bedroom, Canteen, and Cellar. By going north from the Parlor, the user might reach a new area that leads to the workshop. The previous actions of going west and east are not working, so changing direction to north is necessary.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Laundromat, Garage, Parlor, Bedroom, Canteen, and Cellar. The goal is to recover the coin from the workshop. So far, they've been moving east and west without making progress. The key is to break the loop and find a new path.

First, the goal is to reach the workshop and get the coin. The user has been going in circles, so they need to find a different direction. The current room is the Canteen, with exits to north and west. The previous actions were going west to the Cellar, then east to the Canteen again. That's the loop.

Second, the past actions have not led to any new areas. The user needs to try a different exit. Instead of going west, maybe go north from the Canteen. The north exit is unguarded, so that might be a way out of the loop.

Third, the loop is between the Canteen, Cellar, Laundromat, Garage, Parlor, Bedroom. By going north from the Canteen, the user might reach a new area that leads to the workshop. The previous actions of going west and east are not working, so changing direction to north is necessary.

FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Laundromat, Garage, Parlor, Bedroom, Canteen, and Cellar. The goal is to recover the coin from the workshop. So far, they've been moving east and west without making progress. The key is to break the loop and find a new path.

First, the goal is to reach the workshop and get the coin. The user has been going in circles, so they need to find a different direction. The current room is the Cellar, with exits to east and west. The previous actions were going west to the Canteen, then north to the Bedroom, then east to the Parlor, then north to the Laundromat, then west to the Garage, then east back to the Laundromat. That's the loop.

Second, the past actions have not led to any new areas. The user needs to try a different exit. Instead of going west, maybe go east from the Cellar. The east exit is unguarded, so that might be a way out of the loop.

Third, the loop is between the Cellar and Canteen. By going east from the Cellar, the user might reach a new area that leads to the workshop. The previous actions of going west and east are not working, so changing direction to east is necessary.
