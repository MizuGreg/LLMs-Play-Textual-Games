You are now playing a profound game of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, you could, like, make an effort to move south. And then, take a trip east. Then, try to go north. Okay, and then, make an effort to head north. And then, head west. With that over with, attempt to move north. That done, go to the east. Then, move north. After that, pick up the coin from the floor of the vault. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text adventure game, and their goal is to navigate through different rooms, eventually reaching a vault to pick up a coin. The current challenge is that they're stuck in a loop between the Cookhouse and the Cellar.

First, I need to recall the game's objective. The user has to move south, then east, north, north again, west, then north, east, north, and finally pick up the coin in the vault. But so far, they've been moving between the Cookhouse and Cellar repeatedly, which suggests they might be stuck in a loop.

Looking at the previous steps: They started in the Closet, went South to Spare Room, then East to Studio, North to Cellar, North again to Cookhouse, South back to Cellar, North to Cookhouse again, and so on. It seems like they're oscillating between Cellar and Cookhouse. The problem is that the directions available in these rooms are South and North, leading them back and forth.

The next step should be to find a way out of this loop. The user needs to reach the vault, which is probably in a different part of the map. Maybe they need to go West from the Cookhouse, as the prompt mentioned that's an unguarded exit. But in the Cookhouse, the available exits are South and West. So, going West from Cookhouse might lead to a new area.

Wait, in the Cookhouse, the prompt says "You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west." So maybe the user should try going West instead of South. But in the previous steps, they kept going South, which brings them back to the Cellar. If they go West from Cookhouse, perhaps that's a new direction that leads towards the vault.

So the next action should be to go West from the Cookhouse. That would break the loop and take them to a new room, maybe closer to the vault. The user needs to avoid repeating the same actions and find a different path. Therefore, the correct next command is "go west".

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to navigate through the game rooms, following specific directions, and eventually pick up the coin in the vault. So far, they've moved through several rooms, but they're stuck in a loop between the Basement and Cookery.

Looking at their past actions: They went from the Dish-Pit to the Basement, then to Cookery, and back again. The problem is that they're repeatedly going east and west between these rooms without making progress towards the vault. The game's prompt mentions that after certain steps, they need to go north to reach the vault. But currently, they're stuck in a loop, so they need to find a different path.

The next step should be to try going north from the Cookery, as the prompt mentions an exit to the north. That's the direction that was previously mentioned as unguarded. By going north, they might finally reach the vault where the coin is located. Repeating the same actions (east and west) isn't working, so changing direction to north would be the key to breaking the loop and progressing towards the goal.
