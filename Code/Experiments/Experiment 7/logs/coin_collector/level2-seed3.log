Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to venture north. And then, retrieve the coin from the floor of the basement. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Bedroom =-
You arrive in a bedroom. An ordinary kind of place. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked.

GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Basement =-
You find yourself in a basement. A typical kind of place. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."



There is an unguarded exit to the south.

There is a coin on the floor.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text-based game where they need to go north from the bedroom into the basement, then retrieve a coin from the basement floor to win. 

First, the current location is the basement. The user has already gone north from the bedroom, which is the first step. Now, in the basement, there's a coin on the floor. The next logical step is to pick up the coin.

Looking at the previous steps: the user started in the bedroom, went north to the basement. Now, in the basement, they need to collect the coin. The goal is to retrieve the coin and then win. Since the coin is on the floor, the action should be to pick it up. The user hasn't done that yet, so the next step is to take the coin. There's no loop here because the basement is a new location, and the coin is a new object to interact with. So the correct command is "take coin" or "pick up coin". The user needs to execute that action to progress.
