Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, you could, like, head west. Then, make an attempt to take a trip north. And then, retrieve the coin from the floor of the canteen. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Shower =-
Ah, the shower. This is some kind of shower, really great ordinary vibes in this place, a wonderful ordinary atmosphere.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

You're now in the workshop. You begin to take stock of what's here.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. There is an unguarded exit to the north.

You are in a canteen. A normal one. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

There is a coin on the floor.
