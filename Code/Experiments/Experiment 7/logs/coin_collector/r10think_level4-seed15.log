Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First step, head west. Then, make an attempt to take a trip north. And then, make an attempt to head east. Then, retrieve the coin from the floor of the canteen. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Shower =-
You've just walked into a shower.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

>                                                                                                                                -= Shower =-0/1

-= Workshop =-
You find yourself in a workshop. An ordinary one. You begin to take stock of what's here.



There is an unguarded exit to the east. There is an unblocked exit to the north.



>                                                                                                                                -= Workshop =-0/2
AGENT -------------------------------------------------

-= Kitchenette =-
You find yourself in a kitchenette. A typical kind of place.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.



>                                                                                                                                -= Kitchenette =-0/3
AGENT -------------------------------------------------

-= Canteen =-
Well, here we are in a canteen. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.



There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

There is a coin on the floor.


>                                                                                                                                -= Canteen =-0/4
