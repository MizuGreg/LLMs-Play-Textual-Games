Welcome to TextWorld! First thing I need you to do is to go south. Next, recover the coin from the floor of the lounge. That's it!

-= Dish-Pit =-
You find yourself in a dish-pit. A typical one.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

-= Lounge =-
Well how about that, you are in the place we're calling the lounge.



There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

There is a coin on the floor.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in the Lounge, and there's a coin on the floor. The goal is to recover the coin from the floor of the lounge. The user has already gone south from the dish-pit to the lounge. Now, they need to pick up the coin.

First step: The goal is to get the coin in the lounge. So far, the user has arrived at the lounge. The next step is to pick up the coin.

Second step: The user is in the lounge, which is the correct location. The coin is on the floor here. The previous action was moving south, which got them to the right place. Now, they need to collect the coin.

Third step: Are they in a loop? No, because they're in the lounge, and the coin is present. The previous action was moving south, which was necessary. Since the coin is here, the next action should be to pick it up.

Finally, the next action is to pick up the coin. The command should be "take coin" or "pick up coin". But in TextWorld, the correct command is likely "take coin".
