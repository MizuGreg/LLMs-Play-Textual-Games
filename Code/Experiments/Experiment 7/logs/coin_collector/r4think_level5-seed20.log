Welcome to another life changing session of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First of all, you could, like, head north. With that accomplished, go to the north. Then, make an effort to go north. Then, travel east. And then, pick up the coin from the floor of the garage. Got that? Good!

-= Salon =-
You've just sauntered into a salon.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north.

-= Study =-
Well, here we are in the study.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

-= Chamber =-
You arrive in a chamber. A standard one.



There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they have to navigate through different rooms to reach the goal, which I assume is to exit or find something. The current room is the Chamber, and the exit to the north is unguarded. The previous steps were going north from the Salon to the Study, then to the Chamber. The user is told to go north again from the Chamber, but the exit is unguarded. Wait, the prompt says that in the Chamber, there's an exit to the north that's unguarded, and they should try going south if they need an unguarded exit. But the user is already in the Chamber, and the next step might be to go north again. But maybe there's a loop here. Let me check the history again.

The user first went north from the Salon to the Study. Then from the Study, they went north again to the Chamber. Now, in the Chamber, the exit to the north is unguarded. The instruction says to go north, but if that's the case, maybe they're looping between Chamber and another room. Wait, the user is in the Chamber, and the exit to the north is unguarded. So the next logical step is to go north again. But maybe the game is designed so that going north from the Chamber leads to the next room, which might be the exit. Alternatively, maybe the user is stuck in a loop between the Study and Chamber. But according to the previous steps, the user is in the Chamber, and the next step is to go north. However, the user might have already tried that. Wait, the user's last action was "go north" from the Chamber, but the response didn't show any new room. Maybe the user is in a loop. Wait, the initial problem says that the user needs to pick up the coin from the garage. So maybe the exit is not the goal, but finding the coin. But the user hasn't found the coin yet. Let me retrace.

The initial instruction said to go north, then north again, then east, then pick up the coin from the garage. But the current path is Salon -> Study -> Chamber. The user is in the Chamber. The next step would be to go north again, but maybe that's not the right direction. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go south from the Chamber to the Study again, but that's not helpful. Wait, the user is told in the Chamber that the exit to the north is unguarded. So maybe going north from the Chamber is the correct step. But if that's the case, perhaps the next room is the exit. However, the user might be stuck in a loop if going north leads back. But according to the game's structure, each room should have a unique path. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east from the Chamber. But the description of the Chamber says there's an exit to the north and a suggestion to go south. So maybe the correct next step is to go north again. But the user might be in a loop. However, the user's previous steps were going north, so maybe the next step is to go north again. But the user might need to find a different direction. Wait, the initial instruction said to go east after going north twice. So perhaps after reaching the Chamber, the user should go east. But the Chamber's description doesn't mention east. Wait, the user is in the Chamber, and the exit to the north is unguarded. The user needs to go north again. But maybe that's the correct path. Alternatively, maybe the user is in a loop between the Study and Chamber. But according to the game's structure, each room should have a unique path. So the next step is to go north from the Chamber. But the user might have already done that. Wait, the user's last action was "go north" from the Chamber, but the response didn't show a new room. Maybe the user is in a loop. Therefore, the user needs to try a different action, like going south from the Chamber. But the user is told to go south if they need an unguarded exit. However, the user is in the Chamber, and the exit to the north is unguarded. So maybe the correct next step is to go north again. But if that's not working, maybe the user should go east. But the Chamber's description doesn't mention east. Hmm. The initial instruction said to go east after going north twice. So maybe after the Chamber, the user should go east. But the Chamber's description doesn't mention east. Wait, the user is in the Chamber, and the exit to the north is unguarded. So the next step is to go north. But if that's the case, maybe the user is moving towards the exit. So the next action is to go north again.
