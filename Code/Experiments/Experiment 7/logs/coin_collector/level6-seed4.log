THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is in a TextWorld game, and their goal seems to be navigating through different rooms and picking up the coin from the cellar. The initial instructions mentioned moving east, then north, west, etc., but now they're stuck in a loop between the Parlor and Cookhouse.

Looking at the history, the user has been moving east and west between these two rooms repeatedly. The goal was to pick up the coin in the cellar, but the current path isn't leading there. The problem is that the user is stuck in a loop, moving back and forth between Parlor and Cookhouse without progress.

The next step should be to find a different direction. The Parlor has an exit to the south and west, but the Cookhouse has an exit to the north and east. Since the user is in the Parlor again, maybe trying to go south could lead to a new area. Alternatively, checking if there's a hidden item or a different path. But according to the game's current state, the exits are the same. So perhaps the coin is in the cellar, which is accessible through another route. But the user hasn't found the cellar yet. Maybe they need to go west from the Cookhouse to find the cellar exit. Wait, the initial instructions mentioned going west from the Parlor, but that led back. Maybe the correct path is to go north from the Cookhouse to reach the cellar. But the user is stuck in a loop, so they need to try a different action. Instead of going east again, maybe go north from the Cookhouse. But the previous action was go east, which led back. So the next action should be to go north from the Cookhouse to break the loop.
</think>go north

You can't go that way.
