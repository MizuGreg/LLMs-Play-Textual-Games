Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First thing I need you to do is to make an attempt to head east. Following that, make an attempt to venture south. Then, make an effort to take a trip south. And then, pick-up the coin from the floor of the kitchen. Alright, thanks!

-= Pantry =-
You are in a pantry. A standard kind of place.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

go east
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Bar =-
You are in a bar. A normal one.



You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go south
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Salon =-
You are in a salon. A normal kind of place. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

AGENT -------------------------------------------------

GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. A typical one. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.



There is an unguarded exit to the north.

There is a coin on the floor.


>                                                                                                                                -= Kitchen =-0/4
THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in the Kitchen now. The goal was to pick up the coin from the floor of the kitchen. The previous steps were going east from the Pantry, then south to the Bar, then south again to the Salon, and then south once more to the Kitchen. Now, in the Kitchen, there's a coin on the floor. So the next step should be to pick up the coin.

Wait, the user's last action was going south from the Salon to the Kitchen. Now, in the Kitchen, the coin is there. The instruction says to pick up the coin. But the game's response shows that the coin is on the floor. So the correct action here is to take the coin. The user needs to use the command "take coin" or something similar. But in the previous steps, the user was moving directions. So maybe the next command is "take coin". Let me check the previous interactions. The user was told to pick up the coin from the floor of the kitchen. So the next action should be to take the coin. The user hasn't done that yet. So the answer should be "take coin".
</think>take coin
