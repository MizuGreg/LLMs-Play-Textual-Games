Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First off, venture north. And then, travel north. And then, venture east. Following that, attempt to go to the east. That done, retrieve the coin from the floor of the chamber. Alright, thanks!

You're now in a cubicle.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked.
