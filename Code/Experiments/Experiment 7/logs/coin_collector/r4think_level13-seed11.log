It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First, it would be good if you could attempt to move south. With that done, attempt to go east. And then, take a trip north. Once you do that, make an effort to travel west. With that accomplished, take a trip west. Okay, and then, go to the north. And then, make an effort to move north. Then, try to travel east. After that, venture south. If you can get around to doing that, travel south. And then, go west. And then, attempt to travel west. And then, recover the coin from the floor of the studio. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they have to navigate through different rooms and eventually recover a coin from the studio. The current location is the Cookery room. The goal is to follow a series of directions: move south, east, north, west, then again west, north, east, south, west, and finally recover the coin.

Looking at the steps taken so far: the user started in the Pantry, went south to the Cookhouse, then east to the Office, and north to the Cookery. Now, in the Cookery, the options are to go south or west. The next step according to the initial instructions was to go west. But the user might be stuck in a loop if they keep moving back and forth. 

Wait, the user's last action was "go north" from the Office to the Cookery. Now, in the Cookery, the prompt says to try going south or west. The next step in the original plan was to go west. But if going west leads back to a previous room, maybe the user is looping. The user needs to check if moving west is the correct next step or if there's another way. However, the instructions say to follow the sequence: after Cookery, the next steps are to go west, then west again, then north, east, south, west, and finally recover the coin. So maybe the user needs to go west from Cookery. But the user might be repeating steps, so perhaps using a synonym like "go west" again. But the system might not allow repeating the same action. Alternatively, maybe there's another path. However, based on the given information, the next step is to go west from Cookery. So the correct command is "go west".

Okay, let's break this down. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in a text-based game, following a specific sequence of directions. The goal is to eventually recover a coin from the studio. So far, the user has moved through Pantry → Cookhouse → Office → Cookery → Workshop → Cookery → Office → Cookhouse → Pantry. Now, they're back at the Pantry again, which is step 9. The original plan was to go south, east, north, west, west, north, east, south, west, and then recover the coin. But the user is looping between Pantry and Cookhouse, so they need to find a different path.

The next step in the original plan after the Pantry was to go south again. But since the user is already at the Pantry, going south would take them back to the Cookhouse. However, the user might need to find another way. Maybe there's a different exit in the Pantry that wasn't mentioned. The prompt says "You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked." So the only option is south. But that's leading back to the Cookhouse. The user might be stuck in a loop between Pantry and Cookhouse. To break the loop, perhaps they need to go east from the Pantry instead of south? Wait, the Pantry's description says the only unblocked exit is south. So maybe the user has to continue moving south again. But that's the same as before. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east from the Cookhouse instead of north. Let me check the previous steps. The user was in the Cookhouse and tried going north to the Pantry. But maybe going east from the Cookhouse would lead to another room. The Cookhouse's description says "You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded." So east is an option. But the user was in the Cookhouse and went north to the Pantry. Maybe the user should go east instead. But the user is currently in the Pantry, so the next step is to go south again. However, that's the same as before. The user might be stuck in a loop. To break it, perhaps they need to find a different path. But according to the game's structure, the only way is to go south from the Pantry. So the next action is to go south again, even though it's the same as before. But the user needs to proceed until they reach the studio. So the next command is "go south".

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Cookhouse and Office. They've been going back and forth between these two rooms. The goal is to recover the coin from the studio, but they haven't reached that yet.

First, the goal is to follow the sequence of movements: south, east, north, west, west, north, east, south, west, and then find the coin. But they've been looping between Cookhouse and Office, which are part of the earlier steps. Maybe they need to find a different path once they get to the studio.

Looking at the current position, they're in the Office again. The Office has an exit to the north (Cookhouse) and west. The previous actions were going back and forth between these two. To break the loop, maybe they should try a different direction when possible. But the Office only has north and west. Wait, maybe the user needs to go west from the Office to the Cookhouse again, but that's the same as before. Alternatively, maybe there's a different exit in the Office that wasn't mentioned.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Cookhouse and Office. They've been moving east and west between these two rooms repeatedly. The goal is to recover the coin from the studio, but they haven't reached that yet. Let's break this down.

First, the goal steps were: move south, east, north, west, west, north, east, south, west, then find the coin. But the user has been looping between Cookhouse and Office, which are part of the earlier steps. Maybe they need to find a different path once they get to the studio.

Looking at the current position, they're in the Office again. The Office has an exit to the north (Cookhouse) and west. The previous actions were going back and forth between these two. To break the loop, maybe they should try a different direction when possible. But the Office only has north and west. Wait, maybe there's a different exit in the Office that wasn't mentioned. But according to the game's description, the Office has an unblocked exit to the north and west. So the user is stuck in a loop between these two rooms.

The next step should be to try going west again, but since that's the same as before, maybe the user needs to find another way. However, the game might require them to continue moving until they reach the studio. So the next action is to go west again, even though it's the same as before. But the user needs to proceed until they reach the studio. So the command is "go west".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in a text-based game. The goal is to recover a coin from the studio. So far, they've been moving between rooms like Pantry, Cookhouse, Office, Cookery, Workshop, and back. Now they're in the Cookery room.

The current step is to go south from the Cookery, as the prompt says "Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded." But the user might be stuck in a loop if they keep moving back and forth. The previous steps showed them looping between Cookhouse and Office, so maybe they need to find a different path.

Looking at the steps taken: they started in Pantry, went south to Cookhouse, east to Office, north to Cookery, west to Workshop, then back to Cookery, Office, Cookhouse, Pantry, and now Cookery again. The next step should be to go south from Cookery to reach the studio. But the user might have already done that. Wait, the goal was to go south, east, north, west, west, north, east, south, west, then find the coin. So after reaching the studio, they need to find the coin.

But in the current position, they're in Cookery. The next step is to go south to reach the studio. Once there, they can look for the coin. So the next action is "go south".

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.
