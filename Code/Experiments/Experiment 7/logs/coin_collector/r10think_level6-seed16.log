That's not a verb I recognise.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in a text-based game. The goal is to lift the coin in the pantry and win. Let me break down the steps they've taken so far.

First, they started in the Steam Room, went west to the Studio, then south to the Dish-Pit. From there, they went east to the Cubicle, then east again to the Kitchenette, and finally east once more to the Pantry. In the Pantry, they found a coin on the floor. The next step was to lift the coin, but the system didn't recognize "lift" as a valid verb. 

So, the user needs to figure out the correct command to pick up the coin. Since "lift" isn't working, maybe the correct verb is "take" or "pick up". The game might be expecting "take" instead. Let me check the previous commands. The user tried "lift", which was invalid. The correct action here is likely "take the coin" or "pick up the coin". But since the game's response was to use a synonym, the next step is to use "take" instead of "lift".

The user's past actions have successfully navigated to the Pantry and found the coin. The next step is to take the coin. Since "lift" didn't work, "take" is the alternative. So the correct command should be "take coin".
