This is going to sound unbelievable, but you've just entered a shower.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to win this game. The user's goal is to follow a series of directions: go east, then north, west, north, north, east, south, south, south, and finally pick up the coin in the workshop.

Looking at the current environment, the player is in the Cookery again, and the available exits are east and west. The previous actions have been moving back and forth between Cookery and Pantry, which suggests a loop. The user mentioned that if they're in a loop, they need to try a different action, maybe using a synonym.

The next step after the last movement was to go west, but that's leading back to the Cookery. The problem is that the directions require moving north from the Pantry. So maybe the player needs to find a way to go north from the Pantry. The current position is in the Cookery, so perhaps the correct path is to go east again to reach the Pantry, then go north. But the user has been stuck in a loop between Cookery and Pantry. 

Wait, the user's instruction says after going east, then north, west, north, north, east, south, south, south, and then pick up the coin. So maybe the key is to get to the Pantry's north exit. Since the Pantry has an exit to the north, the player needs to go there. But the current position is in the Cookery, so going east again would take them to the Pantry. Then from the Pantry, go north. But the user has been moving east and west repeatedly. 

Alternatively, maybe the player is supposed to go north from the Pantry, but the current position is in the Cookery. So the correct sequence is: from Cookery, go east to Pantry, then go north. But the user's previous actions have been going east and west, which is causing the loop. So the next action should be to go north from the Pantry once they're there. But how to get there? The player needs to go east from Cookery to Pantry, then north. But the user has been stuck in the loop, so maybe the next action is to go east again to reach the Pantry, then go north. However, the user's last action was go west, which is leading back. So the next step is to go east to the Pantry, then north. But the user's current position is in the Cookery, so the next action is go east to reach the Pantry. Then from there, go north. That would be the next steps. But the user's previous actions have been going back and forth, so maybe the correct next action is to go north from the Pantry once they're there. But since they're in the Cookery, they need to go east first. So the next command should be go east.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to follow a specific sequence of movements to pick up the coin in the workshop. The current loop seems to be between the Kitchenette and Bedchamber, going back and forth between them.

First, the goal steps are: go east, north, west, north, north, east, south, south, south, then pick up the coin. So far, the user has moved east, north, west, north, north, east, south, south, but is stuck in a loop between Kitchenette and Bedchamber.

The next step should be to break the loop. Since going north and south is causing the loop, maybe trying a different direction. The Kitchenette has an unguarded exit to the east. Maybe going east from here would lead to a new area where the coin is located. Alternatively, maybe the workshop is in a different direction. But according to the initial instructions, after going south three times, the coin should be in the workshop. So perhaps the correct path is to go east from the Kitchenette to reach the workshop and pick up the coin. But the user is stuck in a loop, so the next action should be to go east instead of north or south.

You are in an usual kind of place. That is to say, you're in a washroom.



There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out how to win this game. The user's goal is to follow a specific sequence of movements to pick up the coin in the workshop. So far, the player has been moving back and forth between the Kitchenette, Bedchamber, and other rooms, getting stuck in a loop.

First, the goal steps are: go east, north, west, north, north, east, south, south, south, then pick up the coin. The user has already done some of these steps, like going east, north, west, etc., but is now stuck in a loop between the Canteen and Washroom.

The next step should be to break the loop. Since the player is in the Canteen and the Washroom, maybe trying a different direction. The Canteen has exits to north and south, but going back and forth between them isn't helping. The user needs to find a way to reach the workshop where the coin is. Maybe the workshop is in a different direction, like east from the Cellar. Earlier, the player was in the Cellar and could go east or south. But the user hasn't tried that yet.

Wait, the user was in the Cellar (0/24) and then went south to the Washroom. Maybe the correct path is to go east from the Cellar to reach the workshop. But the user hasn't tried that. So the next action should be to go east from the Cellar instead of continuing to south. But the current position is in the Canteen, so maybe the user needs to go north to the Washroom again, then east to the Cellar, and then finally go east to the workshop. But the user is stuck in a loop between Canteen and Washroom. So the key is to find a different direction once the loop is broken.

Alternatively, maybe the workshop is in the Cellar, and the coin is there. But the user hasn't picked it up yet. So the next step is to check if the coin is in the Cellar. But the user hasn't looked for it. However, the instructions say to pick up the coin from the floor of the workshop. So the workshop must be a different room. Maybe the Cellar is the workshop. If the user is in the Cellar, they can look for the coin there. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action should be to check the Cellar for the coin. But the user is currently in the Canteen, so they need to go back to the Cellar via the south exit. But the user is stuck in a loop, so maybe the correct action is to go east from the Cellar to reach the workshop and pick up the coin.

You are in a workshop. A typical one. The room is well lit.



There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

There is a coin on the floor.
