Welcome to TextWorld! Here is how to play! First of all, go to the north. And then, lift the coin from the floor of the kitchenette. Alright, thanks!

-= Study =-
You find yourself in a study.



There is an unblocked exit to the north.

-= Kitchenette =-
You've entered a standard room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be standard. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the kitchenette.



There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

There is a coin on the floor.

That's not a verb I recognise.
