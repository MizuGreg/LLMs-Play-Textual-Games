Welcome to TextWorld! Here is how to play! First of all, go to the north. And then, lift the coin from the floor of the kitchenette. Alright, thanks!

-= Study =-
You find yourself in a study.



There is an unblocked exit to the north.

-= Kitchenette =-
You've entered a standard room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be standard. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the kitchenette.



There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

There is a coin on the floor.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in the Kitchenette, and there's a coin on the floor. The goal is to lift the coin from the floor of the kitchenette. The user has already gone north from the Study to reach the Kitchenette. Now, the next step is to pick up the coin.

First, I need to confirm the current location and the items present. The user is in the Kitchenette, which is a standard room. The coin is on the floor here. The previous action was moving north, which got them to the Kitchenette. Now, the task is to pick up the coin.

The user's next action should be to lift the coin. The command would be "lift coin" or "pick up coin". Since the game might expect a specific verb, "lift" is probably correct here. The user needs to perform that action to complete the goal. There's no loop here because moving north was the first step, and now they're in the right place to pick up the coin. So the next step is to lift the coin.

That's not a verb I recognise.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to play TextWorld. The goal is to lift the coin in the kitchenette. The previous action was "lift coin", but the system said that's not a recognized verb.

First, I need to recall the game's objective. The user was told to go north first, then lift the coin. So the steps are: go north, then pick up the coin.

In the current state, the user is in the kitchenette, which is connected to the study via the south exit. The coin is on the floor. The problem is that "lift" isn't working. Maybe the correct verb is "pick up" instead of "lift"? Or maybe "take"?

So, the first step is to confirm the goal: go north, then lift the coin. The user already went north, so the next step is to lift the coin. But since "lift" isn't working, perhaps the correct action is "pick up" or "take the coin".

The user tried "lift coin", which was invalid. So the next action should be "pick up coin" or "take coin". Let me check the possible verbs. In TextWorld, common verbs are "take", "get", "pick up", "lift", etc. But the system might be expecting "take" or "get".

So the next action should be "take coin" or "get coin". Let's try "take coin" as the next command.
