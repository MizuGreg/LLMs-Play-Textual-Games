You are now playing a exciting game of TextWorld! First of all, head north. With that accomplished, go to the north. Then, make an effort to go north. Then, travel east. And then, make an effort to move north. Once you succeed at that, go to the north. With that accomplished, venture west. Once you get around to doing that, move north. After that, make an attempt to venture west. Then, retrieve the coin from the floor of the playroom. Got that? Good!

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing a text adventure game. The goal is to retrieve the coin from the playroom. The current location is the sauna. The previous steps were going north from the bar, then basement, scullery, and now sauna. The next steps mentioned in the initial instructions were to go north again, then west, then north again, and finally get the coin.

But in the sauna, the exits are east and south. The user needs to find the playroom. The playroom might be accessible from the sauna's south exit. But the user was told to go north again, but the sauna's north exit isn't mentioned. Wait, the sauna's description says there's an exit to the east and south. So maybe the next step is to go south from the sauna. But the initial instructions said after the sauna, go north again. Hmm, maybe there's a loop here. The user might be stuck going north and south between rooms without progress. So the next action should be to go south from the sauna to proceed towards the playroom. But the user needs to check if that's the right path. Alternatively, maybe the playroom is in the east exit, but the user hasn't checked that yet. However, the initial plan was to go north, then west, then north again. Maybe the user needs to adjust the direction. But according to the current room, the sauna has a south exit. So the next step should be to go south to continue towards the playroom. Let me make sure. The playroom is the target, so the user needs to find the right path. The previous steps might have led to a loop, so changing direction to south would be the next step.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is stuck in a loop between the Scullery and Sauna. The goal is to get the coin from the playroom. So far, the user has been going back and forth between these two rooms. The problem is that the previous actions (going north and south) aren't leading towards the playroom. The playroom hasn't been reached yet. The user needs to find a different path. Maybe the exit to the east in the sauna is the way to go. The initial instructions mentioned going east after the sauna. So the next step should be to go east from the sauna to proceed towards the playroom. That's the correct direction now.

-= Salon =-
You find yourself in a salon. A standard kind of place.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

You are in a launderette. An ordinary one. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?



There is an unblocked exit to the north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Salon and Launderette. The goal is to get the coin from the playroom. So far, they've tried going north and south but keep looping. The Study was previously visited, but the playroom hasn't been found. The next step should be to check the west exit in the Salon, as that's the only other direction. The user needs to break the loop by trying a new direction. So the next action is go west.

-= Study =-
I never took you for the sort of person who would show up in a study, but I guess I was wrong. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."



There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an unblocked exit to the north.
