Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to travel east. With that over with, pick-up the coin from the floor of the cookery. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Shower =-
You arrive in a shower. A normal one.



There is an unguarded exit to the east.

-= Cookery =-
You arrive in a cookery. A typical one. You begin looking for stuff.



You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a coin on the floor.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user wants me to navigate through TextWorld to pick up a coin in the cookery and win. The first step is to restate the goal: go east to the cookery, pick up the coin. So far, I've gone east, which got me to the cookery. Now, I need to pick up the coin. The next step is to pick up the coin. But the user mentioned that if I'm in a loop, I need to change the action. Since I just arrived in the cookery and there's a coin on the floor, picking it up should be the next move. No loop here, so the action is to pick up the coin.
