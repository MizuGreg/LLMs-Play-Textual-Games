Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First thing I need you to do is to attempt to move south. With that done, attempt to go east. And then, take a trip north. Once you do that, make an effort to travel west. With that accomplished, take a trip west. Okay, and then, go to the north. And then, make an effort to move north. Then, try to travel east. After that, venture south. If you can get around to doing that, pick up the coin from the floor of the attic. Got that? Good!

FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is in a text-based game where they have to navigate through different rooms and perform specific actions. The goal mentioned is to pick up a coin from the attic. The user has already followed some directions: they went south from the cubicle to the kitchen, then east to the sauna. Now, in the sauna, the prompt says to try going north or west.

Looking at the previous steps, the user was told to go south, then east, then north, west, and so on. But in the sauna, the options are north or west. The user needs to follow the sequence: after the sauna, the next steps were supposed to be north, then west, then north again, then east, south, and finally pick up the coin.

Wait, the user is currently in the sauna. The next step according to the initial instructions was to go north from the sauna. But the prompt says "You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded." So maybe the user needs to go north first. But if they go north from the sauna, where do they end up? The initial task was to go north, then west, then north, etc. So perhaps after the sauna, going north would take them to the next room, maybe the attic? But the coin is in the attic. However, the user hasn't picked it up yet.

Wait, the user's task was to move south, east, north, west, north, east, south, and then pick up the coin. But the current position is the sauna. The next step according to the initial instructions was to go north from the sauna. But the prompt says that north is unblocked. So maybe the user should go north here. However, the user might be in a loop if they keep going back and forth. But the user hasn't picked up the coin yet, so they need to find the attic.

Alternatively, maybe after the sauna, going west would take them to another room. But the initial instructions said after going east (to the sauna), then go north. But in the sauna, the options are north or west. So perhaps the user needs to go north from the sauna. Let me check the previous steps again.

Original instructions: After entering the sauna, the user is told to try going north (unblocked) or west (unguarded). The user's next action should be to go north. But if that's the case, then after going north, they might reach the attic. But the user hasn't picked up the coin yet. So maybe after going north from the sauna, they reach the attic, then pick up the coin. However, the user's task was to go north, then west, then north, etc. So maybe the user needs to proceed step by step.

But the user is in the sauna, and the next step according to the initial plan was to go north. So the correct action here is to go north. However, the user might be in a loop if they keep moving between rooms without progress. But since the coin is in the attic, the user needs to reach there. So the next step is to go north from the sauna.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to pick up the coin from the attic. The previous steps involved moving through different rooms: cubicle → kitchen → sauna → studio → office → studio again. Now, they're back in the studio, which suggests a loop between the studio and office.

The initial plan was to move south, east, north, west, north, east, south, and then pick up the coin. But the user is stuck in a loop between the studio and office. So the next step should be to find a way out of this loop. Since the studio has a south and west exit, and the office has east and west, maybe trying a different direction when possible.

In the studio, the options are south (unguarded) or west. The user tried west, which led to the office, and then east back to studio. So instead of repeating the same actions, maybe try going south from the studio instead of west. That way, they can escape the loop and proceed towards the attic. The next action should be 'go south' to break the loop and continue towards the attic.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in a text-based game to pick up a coin from the attic. The main challenge is avoiding loops and progressing towards the attic.

First, the goal is to follow a specific sequence of movements: south, east, north, west, north, east, south, and then pick up the coin. But the user has been stuck in a loop between the sauna, studio, and office. Each time they try to go north from the sauna, they end up back in the studio, which then leads them back to the office and then back to the studio again. This loop is preventing them from moving forward.

Looking at the current position, the user is in the sauna again. The previous actions were going north from the sauna to the studio, then west to the office, east back to the studio, south to the sauna. So the loop is sauna → studio → office → studio → sauna. To break this, the user needs to find a different path. 

The sauna has two exits: north (unblocked) and west (unguarded). The user has been going north, which leads to the studio. Maybe instead of going north, they should go west from the sauna. But wait, the user tried that earlier and ended up in the studio again. Wait, no, when they were in the sauna, going west would take them to the office? Or is it the other way around? Let me check the previous steps.

Wait, earlier when the user was in the sauna, they went north to the studio, then west to the office, then east back to the studio, then south back to the sauna. So the sauna's west exit leads to the office? Or is it the studio? Maybe there's a confusion in the room connections. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to find the attic directly. Since the coin is in the attic, perhaps the user needs to find a way to reach the attic without looping.

But according to the initial instructions, after going south, east, north, west, north, east, south, the user should be able to pick up the coin. However, the user is stuck in a loop. The key is to break the loop by choosing a different direction when possible. Since the user is in the sauna and the options are north and west, maybe going west from the sauna is the way to go, even though it leads to the office. But the office's exit is east and west. Maybe from the office, going west leads to another room. But the user has already tried that.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go north from the sauna again, but that leads back to the studio. Wait, perhaps the user needs to go west from the sauna, which is unguarded, and then find another path. But the user has been going back and forth. The problem is that the same actions are leading them in circles. So the solution is to try a different action when the same path isn't working. Instead of going north again, maybe go west from the sauna. But the user has already done that. Hmm.

Wait, the user is in the sauna again. The previous steps were: sauna → studio → office → studio → sauna. So the user is stuck in a loop between these rooms. The next step should be to try a different direction. Since the sauna has a west exit, maybe going west from the sauna leads to the office, but the user needs to go further. From the office, they can go east back to the studio or west to another room. But the user hasn't explored west from the office. Maybe from the office, going west is the way to go. But the user has been going east from the office back to the studio. So perhaps the user needs to go west from the office instead of east. That would take them to a different room, maybe the attic?

But the user hasn't picked up the coin yet. The coin is in the attic. So the user needs to reach the attic. The initial instructions mention going north, then west, then north, etc. Maybe the user needs to go north from the office? But the office's exit is east and west. Wait, the office's description says: "You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unblocked exit to the west." So from the office, going east leads to the studio, and west is another room. Maybe that west exit leads to the attic. If the user goes west from the office, they might reach the attic where the coin is. But the user hasn't tried that yet. So the next step is to go west from the office, not east. That would break the loop and lead to the attic.

But the user is currently in the sauna. The previous action was going south to the sauna. Now, the user is in the sauna again. The options are north and west. The user needs to go west from the sauna to the office, then west from the office to the attic. So the next action should be going west from the sauna. But the user has already done that. Wait, no, the user was in the sauna, went north to studio, then west to office, then east back to studio, then south to sauna. So the user is back in the sauna. The next step is to go west from the sauna again, which would take them to the office. Then from the office, go west to the attic. But the user hasn't tried that yet. So the correct action is to go west from the sauna, then west from the office. But the user is in the sauna, so the next command is go west.

-= Cookhouse =-
You've entered a cookhouse.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to pick up the coin from the attic. So far, they've been moving through various rooms, but they're stuck in a loop between the Kitchen, Cubicle, Sauna, Studio, Office, and now Cookhouse. The last action was going west from the Office to the Cookhouse. The Cookhouse has exits to east and north. The user needs to find the attic, which is probably connected to one of these rooms.

Looking at the previous steps, the user has been moving back and forth between rooms without making progress towards the attic. The key is to avoid the loop and find a path that leads to the attic. Since the Cookhouse has east and north exits, maybe going north from the Cookhouse is the way to go. But the user needs to check if that's unguarded or unblocked. The prompt says both east and north are unguarded. So, going north might lead to the attic. Alternatively, maybe the east exit leads to another room that connects to the attic. But since the user hasn't picked up the coin yet, they need to find the attic. The next step should be to go north from the Cookhouse to break the loop and proceed towards the attic.
