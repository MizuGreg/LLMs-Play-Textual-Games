Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First thing I need you to do is to make an effort to head west. With that done, move south. And then, head east. And then, move east. Next, make an attempt to venture east. Then, make an attempt to go to the east. Next, make an attempt to go north. And then, lift the coin from the floor of the cookhouse. That's it!

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to follow a series of movements and pick up the coin in the cookhouse. So far, they've gone west, south, east, east, east, north, which led them to the cookhouse. Now, in the cookhouse, the instruction is to lift the coin from the floor. The current room is the cookhouse, and the user needs to pick up the coin.

Looking at the previous steps, the user has already moved through several rooms as per the task. The next step mentioned in the task was to lift the coin. The current room has the coin on the floor, so the next action should be to pick it up. The user hasn't done that yet. The previous actions didn't involve picking up the coin, so the next step is to take the coin. The user might have been moving around but didn't interact with the coin. So the correct action here is to pick up the coin.
</think>take the coin
