Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, make an attempt to venture west. Then, travel west. If you can accomplish that, head south. With that over with, make an effort to move south. Then, attempt to head west. And then, lift the coin from the floor of the cookhouse. Got that? Good!

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text adventure game and needs to follow specific steps to reach the cookhouse and lift the coin. Let me recap the goal.

First, the user needs to venture west, then travel west again. After that, go south, then try to move south again. Finally, lift the coin from the cookhouse's floor. 

Looking at the current environment, the user is in the Basement. The exits are north and west. The previous actions were going west from Laundry Place to Cubicle, then to Garage, then to Closet, then to Basement. The next step according to the initial instructions was to go south from the Closet, which led to the Basement. Now, in the Basement, the user needs to proceed.

The user's next step should be to check if they can go west from the Basement. The description says there's an unguarded exit to the west. So going west from the Basement would be the next move. Then, perhaps they'll reach the cookhouse. But the coin is in the cookhouse's floor, so after getting there, they need to pick it up. But the current step is to move west from the Basement. Let me confirm the steps again.

The user has already done: go west (Laundry to Cubicle), go west again (Cubicle to Garage), go south (Garage to Closet), go south again (Closet to Basement). Now, from the Basement, the next step is to go west. Then, maybe they reach the cookhouse. Once there, they can lift the coin. So the next action is go west.

There is a coin on the floor.
