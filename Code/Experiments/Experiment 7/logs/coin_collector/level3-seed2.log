It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First of all, you could, like, try to venture north. After that, head east. That done, lift the coin from the floor of the bedchamber. That's it!

-= Spare Room =-
You are in a spare room. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.



There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go north
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. A normal one.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go east
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Bedchamber =-
You arrive in a bedchamber. An ordinary kind of place.



You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a coin on the floor.
