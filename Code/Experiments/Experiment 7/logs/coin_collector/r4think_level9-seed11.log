Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First step, attempt to move south. With that done, attempt to go east. And then, take a trip north. Once you do that, make an effort to travel west. With that accomplished, take a trip west. Okay, and then, go to the north. And then, make an effort to move north. Then, try to travel east. After that, recover the coin from the floor of the cookery. That's it!

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let me try to figure out how to solve this game. The user's goal is to recover the coin from the floor of the cookery. Let me go through the steps they've taken so far.

First, they started in the cubicle, went south to the kitchen. Then they went east to the sauna. Now they're in the sauna, and the prompt says to try going north or west. The previous actions were moving south, east, and now maybe north or west. But the user's instructions mentioned moving north, east, west, etc., but I need to check if they've followed the correct path.

Wait, the user's initial instructions were to move south, then east, then north, then west, then north again, then east, and finally retrieve the coin. But in the current scenario, they're in the sauna. The sauna's description mentions an unguarded exit to the west. So maybe the next step is to go west from the sauna. But the user's previous action was going east to the sauna, so maybe they need to go west from there. However, the user's next step might be to go north from the sauna, but the prompt says to try going north or west. 

But the main goal is to get to the cookery and find the coin. The cookery is probably in the kitchen, but the user is now in the sauna. So maybe they need to find a way back to the kitchen. The sauna's exit is west, so going west from the sauna might take them back to the kitchen. Then from the kitchen, they can go north or east again. Wait, but the user's previous steps were moving south, east, then maybe north or west. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is in a loop between the sauna and kitchen. The initial steps required moving south, east, north, west, etc. But the current position is the sauna. The next step might be to go west to return to the kitchen. Then from the kitchen, go north to the cookery. But the user's instructions said after going west, then go north again. Wait, the original instructions were: after moving south, east, north, west, then north again, east, then get the coin. 

So perhaps the user needs to go west from the sauna to the kitchen, then north to the cookery. Then find the coin. But the current step is in the sauna. The prompt says to try going north or west. The user's next action should be to go west to exit the sauna and return to the kitchen. Then proceed to the cookery. So the next command should be "go west".

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to recover the coin from the cookery. So far, the player has moved through several rooms: cubicle, kitchen, sauna, back to kitchen, and then to sauna again. The pattern seems to be looping between the kitchen and sauna. The original instructions mentioned moving south, east, north, west, etc., but it's possible the player is stuck in a loop between these rooms.

Looking at the current position, the player is in the kitchen again. The previous actions were going east to the sauna, then west back to the kitchen. This loop suggests that the player hasn't progressed towards the cookery yet. The cookery might be a different room that's not part of this loop. The user's instructions mentioned going north from the kitchen to reach the cookery, but maybe that's not the case here.

The next step should be to find a way to get to the cookery. Since the kitchen is mentioned as an ordinary place, maybe there's a hidden path or a different direction to go. The player has tried east and north in the kitchen, but maybe they need to check other directions like south or west. However, the previous attempts to go south led back to the cubicle, which doesn't seem helpful.

Alternatively, maybe the cookery is in a different part of the kitchen. The player needs to look for the coin in the kitchen's floor. But the game's description says the coin is in the cookery, so the player must reach that room. Since the current position is the kitchen, perhaps the next step is to go north from the kitchen to reach the cookery. But the user's previous action was going east to the sauna, so maybe they need to try a different direction.

Wait, in the kitchen, the prompt says to try going east or north. The player has already tried east (sauna) and north (cubicle). But the cookery isn't mentioned yet. Maybe the cookery is accessible from the kitchen via a different path. Alternatively, the player might need to explore the kitchen more thoroughly to find the coin, but the game's goal is to get to the cookery.

Since the player is stuck in a loop, the next action should be to try a different direction. Maybe west from the kitchen, but that led to the cubicle. Alternatively, perhaps the player needs to go south from the kitchen again, but that's the cubicle. Hmm. Maybe the correct path is to go north from the kitchen to reach the cookery, but the previous attempt to go north led to the cubicle. Wait, maybe the cookery is a different room that's not part of the loop. The player needs to find the right path.

Alternatively, maybe the coin is already in the kitchen, but the game says it's in the cookery. So the player must reach the cookery. Since the kitchen is connected to the sauna and cubicle, perhaps the cookery is connected to the kitchen via another exit. The player needs to find that exit. The previous steps didn't explore all directions, so maybe trying a different direction like west or south again. But the user's instructions said to go north from the kitchen. Maybe the player needs to go north again, even though it led to the cubicle before. But the cubicle is part of the loop. Maybe the cookery is in a different part of the kitchen.

Alternatively, the player might need to look for the coin in the kitchen, but the game says it's in the cookery. So the correct path is to go north from the kitchen to reach the cookery. Even though previous attempts led to the cubicle, maybe there's another way. The player should try going north again, even if it's the same as before, but perhaps the game allows progress. So the next action is to go north.

Okay, let's see. The user's goal is to recover the coin from the cookery. So far, the player has been looping between the kitchen, sauna, and cubicle. The previous actions were going south, east, north, west, and back again. The problem is that the player is stuck in a loop and hasn't reached the cookery yet.

First, I need to recall the original instructions: move south, then east, then north, west, north, east, and then get the coin. But the player is repeatedly going between the kitchen and sauna, not progressing towards the cookery. The cookery must be a different room that's not part of this loop. Maybe the player needs to find another exit or direction in the kitchen that wasn't tried yet.

In the kitchen, the prompts suggest trying east or north. The player has tried east (sauna) and north (cubicle). But the cookery isn't mentioned here. Perhaps the cookery is accessible from the kitchen via a different path, like west or south. But going south leads back to the cubicle, which is part of the loop. Alternatively, maybe the player needs to explore the kitchen more thoroughly to find the coin, but the game says the coin is in the cookery.

Since the player is stuck in a loop, the next step should be to try a different action. The previous actions were going north and south, which are leading back to the same places. Maybe the player needs to try going east again, but that's the sauna. Alternatively, maybe the player needs to look for the coin in the kitchen even though the game says it's in the cookery. But the game's goal is to get to the cookery.

Wait, the user's original instructions said to go to the north after moving west. Maybe the cookery is north of the kitchen. But when the player tried going north from the kitchen, they ended up in the cubicle. Maybe the cookery is a different room that's not part of the loop. The player needs to find a way to get to the cookery without looping. Since the player is stuck, the next action should be to try a different direction, like west again, but that's the cubicle. Alternatively, maybe the player needs to use a synonym for the action, like "go west" instead of "go south" if that's the issue.

But the game is forcing the player to loop, so the next step is to break the loop by trying a different action. The player has tried all directions in the kitchen except maybe south, but that leads back. Maybe the correct path is to go east again, but that's the sauna. Alternatively, the player needs to find the coin in the kitchen, but the game says it's in the cookery. So the only way is to get to the cookery. Since the player is stuck, the next action should be to go north again, even though it's the same as before, but maybe the game allows progress. However, the previous attempt to go north led to the cubicle. So perhaps the player needs to try a different action, like "go east" again, but that's the sauna. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the player needs to look for the coin in the kitchen, even though the game says it's in the cookery. But the game's goal is to get to the cookery. So the player must find a way to get there. Since the player is stuck in a loop, the next action should be to try a different direction, like west, but that's the cubicle. Maybe the player needs to go south again, but that's the same as before. I'm confused. The correct next step is to go north again, even though it's part of the loop, but maybe the game allows progress. So the next action is "go north".
