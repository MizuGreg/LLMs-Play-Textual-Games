Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, you could, like, make an attempt to head east. Following that, make an attempt to venture south. Then, make an effort to take a trip south. And then, make an effort to travel south. If you can manage that, attempt to go east. Then, go to the south. Following that, attempt to take a trip west. And then, attempt to venture south. Next, pick up the coin from the floor of the studio. Once that's all handled, you can stop!
