Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, you could, like, try to venture north. After that, recover the coin from the floor of the kitchen. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Bedchamber =-
You've entered a bedchamber. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north.

-= Kitchen =-
You've just sauntered into a kitchen. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.



You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a coin on the floor.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in the Kitchen, and the goal is to recover the coin on the floor and then win. The previous action was going north from the Bedchamber to the Kitchen. Now, in the Kitchen, the coin is on the floor. So the next step is to pick up the coin. The user needs to pick it up and then exit, but since the task is done once the coin is recovered, that's the key. The user should pick up the coin first. The command would be "pick up coin".
