Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. Your first objective is to head north. With that accomplished, go to the north. Then, make an effort to go north. Then, travel east. And then, make an effort to move north. Once you succeed at that, go to the north. With that accomplished, pick up the coin from the floor of the bar. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Salon =-
Well, here we are in the salon.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north.

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in a TextWorld game. Their task is to navigate through different rooms, eventually pick up a coin in the bar. The current location is the Sauna, and the previous actions were going north three times, leading to the Sauna. The goal is to go north, then east, then north again, then pick up the coin.

Wait, the user's last action was "go north" which took them to the Sauna. Now, in the Sauna, the prompt says to try going east or south. The user needs to go east next. But the previous steps might have been a loop. Let me check the steps again.

Original goal: Head north (done), then go north again (done), then travel east (next step?), then make an effort to move north again. But the user is in the Sauna now. The Sauna's exits are east and south. So maybe the next step is to go east. But the user might be stuck in a loop if they keep going north. Wait, the user went north three times: Salon → Study → Chamber → Sauna. So the next step after Sauna is to go east. Then, after east, maybe they can go north again to reach the bar. Then pick up the coin. So the next action should be "go east".
