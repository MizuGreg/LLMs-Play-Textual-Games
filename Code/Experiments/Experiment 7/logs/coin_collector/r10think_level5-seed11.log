Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First, it would be great if you could attempt to move south. With that done, attempt to go east. And then, take a trip north. Once you do that, make an effort to travel west. With that accomplished, pick up the coin from the floor of the office. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Cookhouse =-
You are in a cookhouse. An ordinary one.



You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.
