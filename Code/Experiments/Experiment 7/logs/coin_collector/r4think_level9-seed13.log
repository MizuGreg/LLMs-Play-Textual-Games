Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First thing I need you to do is to make an effort to head west. With that done, move south. And then, head east. And then, move east. Next, make an attempt to venture east. Then, make an attempt to go to the east. Next, make an attempt to go north. And then, attempt to venture west. And then, lift the coin from the floor of the attic. That's it!

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to navigate through the TextWorld environment according to the specific steps given. The task involves moving in certain directions and eventually lifting a coin from the attic.

First, I need to recap the goal. The user needs to go west, then south, east, east, east, north, west, and finally pick up the coin in the attic. So far, the user has moved west, south, east, east. The next steps according to the initial instructions are to venture east again, then go north, then venture west. But the current location is the Bar, with exits to east and west. The user is at the Bar, which is part of the sequence.

Looking at the previous steps: the user started at the Laundromat, went west to the Chamber, then south to the Closet, east to the Canteen, east to the Bar. The next step in the original instructions was to venture east again. However, in the Bar, the exits are east and west. The user needs to go east again, but the next step after that would be north. But the user is at the Bar, so going east would take them to the next location. However, the user's next action should be to go east again, then north, then west. But the user is at the Bar, so the next action is to go east. Wait, the user's current location is the Bar, and the next step in the original instructions is to "make an attempt to venture east" again. So the next action is to go east from the Bar. Then, after that, go north, then west. But the user is at the Bar, so the next step is to go east. However, the user might be in a loop if they keep going back and forth. But according to the instructions, they need to proceed step by step. So the next action is to go east again from the Bar. Then, after that, go north. But the user is at the Bar, so the next action is go east. Then, after that, go north. But the user needs to check if they are in a loop. However, the user hasn't reached the attic yet. So the next action is to go east again. But the user is at the Bar, and the exit to the east is unblocked. So the next step is to go east. Then, from the next location, go north. But the user's current step is to go east again. So the next action is go east.

-= Studio =-
You've entered a studio.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

Well, here we are in a scullery. The room is well lit.



There is an unguarded exit to the north. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

Okay, let's see. The user's goal is to follow a specific sequence of movements: west, south, east, east, east, north, west, then pick up the coin in the attic. So far, the user has gone west (from Laundromat to Chamber), south (to Closet), east (to Canteen), east (to Bar), east (to Studio), and now they're in the Scullery. The next step according to the original instructions is to go north from the Studio. But in the Scullery, the exits are north and west. Wait, the user just came from the Studio, so they're in the Scullery. The next step in the sequence after going east from the Bar (which is the fifth step) is to go north. But the user is now in the Scullery. So the next action should be to go north. However, the user might be looping if they keep moving between rooms. But according to the steps, after the Studio, the next direction is north. So the next action is to go north. But the user is in the Scullery, and the exit to the north is unguarded. So the correct next step is to go north. Then, after that, the next step would be to go west. But the user needs to check if they're on the right path. Since the original instructions say after going east from the Bar (which is the fifth step), then go north, then venture west. So from the Scullery, going north would take them to the next room, then west from there. But the user is currently in the Scullery, so the next action is to go north. Therefore, the next command is go north.

-= Cookhouse =-
Well, here we are in the cookhouse.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.
