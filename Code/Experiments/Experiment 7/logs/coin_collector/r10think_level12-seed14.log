THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in a text-based game. The goal is to retrieve a coin from the studio floor after moving through various directions. Let me recap the steps they've taken so far.

Starting in the Office, they went east to the Cellar, then east again to the Workshop. From there, they went north to the Canteen, then east again. Then they tried going west, which brought them back to the Canteen. Then they tried going north again, but it's blocked. So now they're stuck in a loop between the Canteen and the Chamber.

The next step according to the initial plan was to venture south from the Canteen, but the user tried going north instead, which didn't work. So maybe they need to try a different direction. The Canteen has an unguarded exit to the east and an unblocked exit to the south. Since going north is blocked, perhaps they should go south instead. But wait, the previous action was going west from the Chamber, which led back to the Canteen. Then trying to go north from the Canteen is blocked. So maybe the correct next step is to go south from the Canteen to exit to the south, which might lead to another area. But the user is stuck in a loop, so they need to find another way. Maybe they need to go east again from the Canteen, but that's where they came from. Alternatively, maybe there's a different path. The key is to break the loop by trying a different action. Since going north is blocked, perhaps going south is the next step. But the user tried that already? Wait, the last action was going north which failed. So the next step should be to go south from the Canteen. Let me check the previous steps again. The user was in the Canteen, tried going north (blocked), so the next step should be to go south. But the user is in the Canteen, and the exits are east and south. So the correct action is to go south. But the user might have already done that? Wait, the history shows that after going west from the Chamber, they returned to the Canteen, then tried going north (blocked), so the next step is to go south. That would take them to the next room, perhaps the Studio. Then they can retrieve the coin. So the next command should be 'go south'.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is stuck in a loop between the Workshop and Canteen. The goal is to retrieve the coin from the studio. So far, they've been going back and forth between these two rooms. The problem is that every time they try to go north from the Canteen, it's blocked, so they end up going south again, which brings them back to the Workshop. Then they try north again, and it's the same loop.

First step: The goal is to get to the studio and pick up the coin. The user needs to find a path that leads them there without getting stuck in a loop.

Second step: The user has tried going east, north, west, and south multiple times, but they're stuck between the Workshop and Canteen. The next step should be to find another exit that hasn't been tried yet. But in the current rooms, the exits are limited. Maybe they need to check if there's another direction available, like west from the Workshop, which is unblocked. Wait, in the Workshop, there's an unblocked exit to the west. Maybe going west from the Workshop could lead to a different area. But the user has been going north from the Canteen, which is blocked, so maybe they need to try a different direction from the Workshop.

Third step: The loop is between Workshop and Canteen. To break it, the user should try going west from the Workshop instead of north. That way, they can exit to a new room that might lead to the studio. The previous actions of going north from Canteen are causing the loop, so changing the direction to west in the Workshop could be the key. So the next action should be 'go west' from the Workshop.

So far, they've been going back and forth between these rooms without making progress. The problem is that every time they try to go north from the Canteen, it's blocked, leading them back to the Workshop. Then they go west to the Cellar, east back to the Workshop, and so on.

First step: The goal is to reach the studio and get the coin. The user needs to find a path that leads them there without getting stuck in the loop.

Second step: The user has tried multiple directions, but they're stuck in a cycle. The next step should be to find a different exit that hasn't been tried yet. However, in the current rooms, the exits are limited. Maybe they need to check if there's another direction available, like west from the Workshop, which is unblocked. But the user has already tried that.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Workshop, Canteen, and Cellar. The goal is to get to the studio and retrieve the coin. They've been going back and forth between these rooms without making progress. The problem is that every time they try to go north from the Canteen, it's blocked, leading them back to the Workshop. Then they go west to the Cellar, east back to the Workshop, and so on.

First step: The goal is to reach the studio and get the coin. The user needs to find a path that leads them there without getting stuck in the loop.

Second step: The user has tried multiple directions, but they're stuck in a cycle. The next step should be to find a different exit that hasn't been tried yet. However, in the current rooms, the exits are limited. Maybe they need to check if there's another direction available, like west from the Workshop, which is unblocked. But the user has already tried that.

Third step: The loop is between Workshop, Canteen, and Cellar. To break it, the user should try a different action. Instead of going north from the Canteen, maybe they should go east again. But the user has already done that. Wait, in the Canteen, there's an unguarded exit to the east. Maybe going east from the Canteen would lead to a new area. But the user tried that and ended up back in the Workshop. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the studio is accessible from the Cellar by going west. But the Cellar has an exit to the west. Wait, the user is in the Cellar, and the exit to the west is unguarded. Maybe going west from the Cellar would lead to the studio. But the user hasn't tried that yet. So the next action should be to go west from the Cellar.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Workshop, Canteen, and Cellar. The goal is to get to the studio and retrieve the coin. They've been going back and forth without making progress. The problem is that every time they try to go north from the Canteen, it's blocked, leading them back to the Workshop. Then they go west to the Cellar, east back to the Workshop, and so on.

First step: The goal is to reach the studio and get the coin. The user needs to find a path that leads them there without getting stuck in the loop.

Second step: The user has tried multiple directions, but they're stuck in a cycle. The next step should be to find a different exit that hasn't been tried yet. However, in the current rooms, the exits are limited. Maybe they need to check if there's another direction available, like west from the Workshop, which is unblocked. But the user has already tried that.

Third step: The loop is between Workshop, Canteen, and Cellar. To break it, the user should try a different action. Instead of going north from the Canteen, maybe they should go east again. But the user has already done that. Wait, in the Canteen, there's an unguarded exit to the east. Maybe going east from the Canteen would lead to a new area. But the user tried that and ended up back in the Workshop. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the studio is accessible from the Cellar by going west. But the Cellar has an exit to the west. Wait, the user is in the Cellar, and the exit to the west is unguarded. Maybe going west from the Cellar would lead to the studio. But the user hasn't tried that yet. So the next action should be to go west from the Cellar.

FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Workshop, Canteen, and Cellar. The goal is to get to the studio and retrieve the coin. They've been going back and forth without making progress. The problem is that every time they try to go north from the Canteen, it's blocked, leading them back to the Workshop. Then they go west to the Cellar, east back to the Workshop, and so on.

First step: The goal is to reach the studio and get the coin. The user needs to find a path that leads them there without getting stuck in the loop.

Second step: The user has tried multiple directions, but they're stuck in a cycle. The next step should be to find a different exit that hasn't been tried yet. However, in the current rooms, the exits are limited. Maybe they need to check if there's another direction available, like west from the Workshop, which is unblocked. But the user has already tried that.

Third step: The loop is between Workshop, Canteen, and Cellar. To break it, the user should try a different action. Instead of going north from the Canteen, maybe they should go east again. But the user has already done that. Wait, in the Canteen, there's an unguarded exit to the east. Maybe going east from the Canteen would lead to a new area. But the user tried that and ended up back in the Workshop. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the studio is accessible from the Cellar by going west. But the Cellar has an exit to the west. Wait, the user is in the Cellar, and the exit to the west is unguarded. Maybe going west from the Cellar would lead to the studio. But the user hasn't tried that yet. So the next action should be to go west from the Cellar.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.
