Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! First off, venture east. Then, make an attempt to travel east. With that over with, make an attempt to venture north. Then, travel east. Following that, take a trip north. Following that, make an attempt to take a trip west. With that accomplished, venture south. Then, recover the coin from the floor of the laundromat. Got that? Good!

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in TextWorld. The goal mentioned earlier was to venture east, then east again, then north, then north, then west, then south, and finally recover the coin from the laundromat. But the current situation is that the user is in the Cellar again after moving west and east repeatedly.

Looking at the steps taken so far: the user started in the Office, went east to the Cellar, then west back to the Office, then east again to the Cellar. This seems like a loop between the Office and Cellar. The next step according to the initial instructions was to travel north, but the Cellar's description mentions an unguarded exit to the west and suggests trying east again. However, the user is stuck in a loop here.

The user needs to break this loop. Since moving east and west is leading back to the same places, maybe there's another way. But according to the environment, the only exits mentioned are east and west in the Cellar. The Office has an exit to the east. Maybe the key is to find the laundromat, which is mentioned in the initial instructions. But the current location is the Cellar. Wait, the initial goal was to recover the coin from the laundromat's floor. So perhaps the laundromat is another room, but the user hasn't reached it yet.

But the current path is looping between Office and Cellar. The user needs to find a way out of this loop. Maybe the next step is to go north from the Cellar, but the description says to try east if there's no unblocked exit. Wait, the Cellar's description says "You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. There is an unguarded exit to the west." So maybe the user is supposed to go east again, but that leads back to the Office. Alternatively, maybe there's a north exit that's not mentioned? Or perhaps the user needs to check the Cellar's contents for the coin.

Wait, the initial instructions said to "recover the coin from the floor of the laundromat." So maybe the laundromat is a different room. The user has to find the laundromat, go there, pick up the coin. But the current path is stuck in the Office and Cellar. Maybe the user needs to go north from the Cellar, but the description doesn't mention a north exit. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to look for items in the Cellar. The problem is that the user hasn't found the coin yet, so maybe the coin is in the Cellar or another room.

But according to the current state, the user is in the Cellar again. The next step should be to check if there's a north exit. However, the Cellar's description doesn't mention a north exit. The user might need to try going north, even if it's not mentioned, but the game might have that. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to find the laundromat through another path. But the initial steps were to go east, east, north, north, west, south. Maybe the user is supposed to go south from the Cellar, but the Cellar's description says there's an exit to the west. Wait, the Cellar's description says "There is an unguarded exit to the west." So maybe the user can go west again, but that's back to the Office. 

This seems like a loop. The user needs to break the loop. The initial instructions said to go east, then east, then north, then north, then west, then south. But the user is stuck in the loop between Office and Cellar. Maybe the user needs to find another way. Alternatively, maybe the coin is in the Cellar, and the user needs to pick it up. But the user hasn't checked the Cellar's items yet. The initial instructions didn't mention checking for items, only moving around. 

Wait, the user's goal was to recover the coin from the laundromat. So maybe the laundromat is a different room. The user needs to find the laundromat, which might be accessible through the Office or Cellar. But the current path is looping. The user needs to find a way to proceed. Since the user is in the Cellar, maybe the next step is to go north, even if it's not mentioned, but the game might have that. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go south from the Cellar, but the Cellar's description says there's an exit to the west. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check the Office for something. The Office has an exit to the east. Maybe the user needs to go east again, but that's back to the Cellar. This is confusing. The user needs to find the laundromat, but the path is stuck. Maybe the correct next step is to go north from the Cellar, even if it's not mentioned, but the game might have that. Alternatively, the user might need to look for items in the Cellar. The problem is that the user hasn't checked the Cellar's contents yet. The initial instructions didn't mention looking for items, only moving. 

But the user's goal is to recover the coin, so maybe the coin is in the Cellar. The user needs to check. However, the user's previous actions were moving between rooms, not looking for items. So maybe the next step is to look for the coin in the Cellar. But the game's description doesn't mention that. The user needs to find a way to proceed. Since the user is stuck in a loop, the next action should be different. Maybe instead of going east or west, the user should try going north, even if it's not mentioned. But the Cellar's description says to try east if there's no unblocked exit. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go south from the Cellar, but the Cellar's description says there's an exit to the west. 

This is a bit confusing. The user needs to break the loop. The previous actions were going east and west repeatedly. The next step should be to try a different direction, like north, even if it's not mentioned. So the next action would be "go north" from the Cellar.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is stuck in a loop between the Cellar and Workshop. The goal was to navigate through specific directions and find the coin in the laundromat. But so far, the user has been moving east and west, which isn't progressing towards the laundromat.

First, the goal steps were: go east, then east again, then north, then north, then west, then south, and finally get the coin. But the current path is looping between Cellar and Workshop. The user needs to break this loop.

The user has been going east and west repeatedly, which isn't helping. The next step should be to try a different direction, like north, even though the Cellar's description suggests going east. But since that's not working, maybe the Workshop has a north exit that leads to the laundromat. The Workshop's description mentions an exit to the north. So maybe going north from the Workshop is the key.

The user's past actions have been moving east and west, which isn't progressing. The next action should be to go north from the Workshop to escape the loop and proceed towards the laundromat.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in TextWorld. The goal was to follow specific directions: venture east, then east again, then north, then north, then west, then south, and finally recover the coin from the laundromat. But the user is stuck in a loop between the Office, Cellar, Workshop, and now the Canteen.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Canteen, which has exits to the east and south. The previous steps involved moving east and west repeatedly, leading to the Workshop and back. Now, the Canteen is a new room, so maybe the coin is here or nearby.

The user needs to break the loop. The previous actions of going east and west didn't progress towards the laundromat. The next step should be to check the Canteen's exits. The description says to try going east or south. Since the user is in the Canteen, maybe going south is the right move. The laundromat might be south of the Canteen. Alternatively, the coin could be in the Canteen, so the user should look around.

The user's past actions have been moving between rooms without finding the coin. The next action should be to go south from the Canteen to proceed towards the laundromat. That's the logical next step to avoid looping and get closer to the goal.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Cellar, Workshop, and Canteen. The goal was to navigate through specific directions to find the coin. The user has been moving east and west repeatedly, which isn't progressing.

First, the goal steps were: go east, east, north, north, west, south, then get the coin. But the user is looping between rooms without reaching the laundromat.

The user's past actions have been moving east and west, leading back to the same places. The next step should be different. The Canteen has exits to east and south, but going south led back to the Workshop. Maybe the coin is in the Canteen, so the user needs to check there. Alternatively, the user needs to find a different path. Since the previous actions didn't work, the next action should be to go north from the Workshop, even though it's not mentioned. But the user can't go north from the Cellar. So, the correct next step is to go east from the Canteen to break the loop.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

You've just walked into a cellar. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.
