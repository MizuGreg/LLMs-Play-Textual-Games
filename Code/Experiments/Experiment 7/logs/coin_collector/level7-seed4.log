Welcome to TextWorld! Here is how to play! First of all, travel east. With that over with, venture east. And then, make an attempt to venture north. That done, take a trip west. With that accomplished, make an attempt to take a trip north. Following that, make an attempt to go to the north. And then, retrieve the coin from the floor of the kitchenette. That's it!

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Shower and Cookery areas. The goal is to retrieve the coin from the kitchenette. The previous actions were going east and west repeatedly, which isn't making progress.

First, I need to recall the original plan: go east, then north, then west, then north again, and finally get the coin. But the user keeps getting stuck when trying to go north in the Cookery. Maybe there's a different path or a hidden way to get to the kitchenette without going through the shower again.

The user is in the Shower area again, so maybe they need to find another exit. The Cookery has an exit to the east and west. Wait, the initial instruction said to go east, then north, then west, then north. But in the Cookery, going north isn't possible. Maybe the correct path is to go east from the Cookery to the Shower again, but that's not helping. Alternatively, maybe there's a different direction or an object to interact with.

Wait, the user mentioned retrieving the coin from the kitchenette. Maybe the coin is in the Cookery area. The user needs to check the Cookery for the coin. But the previous steps didn't mention looking for items. The user might have missed that. So the next step is to look for the coin in the Cookery instead of trying to move north again.

So the next action should be to check the Cookery for the coin. The user was supposed to retrieve it after moving north, but maybe the coin is already there. So the correct step is to look for the coin in the current location (Cookery) instead of trying to go north again.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is stuck in a loop between the Shower and Cookery areas. The goal is to retrieve the coin from the kitchenette. The previous actions involved repeatedly going east and west, which isn't making progress.

First, the goal steps are: go east, then north, then west, then north again, and finally get the coin. But in the Cookery, going north isn't possible. So maybe the coin is in the Cookery, and the user hasn't checked properly. The user tried looking for the coin but couldn't see it. Maybe they need to check again or look for another way.

The user is in a loop, so the next step should be to find a different action. Instead of going east and west repeatedly, maybe they need to check the Cookery for the coin again. Alternatively, maybe there's another exit or object to interact with. Since the previous actions didn't work, the next command should be to look for the coin again or check the items in the Cookery.

FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Shower and Cookery. The goal is to get the coin from the kitchenette. They've been going east and west repeatedly, which isn't working. The previous steps didn't find the coin, so maybe the coin is in the Cookery. The user needs to check again or find another way. Since going north isn't possible, maybe the answer is to look for the coin in the Cookery again. But the user tried that and couldn't see it. Maybe the correct action is to check the items in the Cookery again or look for another exit. But the game might require a different command, like 'look' or 'check'. However, the allowed commands are movement. So the next step is to try going east again, but that's already been done. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west from the Cookery to the Shower again, but that's not helping. The loop is between the two rooms, so the solution is to find the coin in the Cookery when possible. The user might have missed it before. So the next action is to look for the coin again in the Cookery.
