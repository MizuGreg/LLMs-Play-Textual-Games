I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! First of all, make an attempt to head east. Following that, make an attempt to venture south. Then, make an effort to take a trip south. And then, make an effort to travel south. If you can manage that, pick-up the coin from the floor of the office. That's it!

-= Pantry =-
You are in a pantry. A standard kind of place.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

-= Bar =-
You are in a bar. A normal one.



You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

-= Salon =-
You are in a salon. A normal kind of place. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to proceed. The user is in the Salon room, and the previous actions were going east from the Pantry, then south to the Bar, then south again to the Salon. The goal is to pick up the coin from the office by moving south three times and then collecting the coin.

Wait, the current room is the Salon. The instructions mentioned that after going south three times, you should pick up the coin. But the user has already gone east, then south (Bar), then south again (Salon). That's two south moves. Maybe the third south is needed here. But the Salon's description says to try north or south. If going south from Salon is possible, then that would be the third south step. But the user is in the Salon, and the next step should be to go south again. However, the previous attempt to go south from Salon might not be working, or maybe there's a loop. Wait, the user's previous action was "go south" from Salon, but the response didn't show a change. Maybe the user is stuck in a loop between Salon and Bar? Or maybe the third south is required to reach the office. Let me check the original instructions again.

Original instructions: "make an attempt to head east. Following that, make an attempt to venture south. Then, make an effort to take a trip south. And then, make an effort to travel south. If you can manage that, pick-up the coin from the floor of the office. That's it!"

So the sequence is: East (Pantry), South (Bar), South (Salon), South (next room). Then pick up the coin. So from Salon, going south again should be the next step. But the user is in Salon, and the previous action was "go south" which might not have worked. Wait, the user's last input was "go south" in the Salon, but the response was the same Salon description. Maybe the user is in a loop between Salon and Bar? Or maybe the third south is required. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go north from Salon to break the loop. But the original plan was to go south three times. So perhaps the next step is to go south again from Salon, even if it's the same room. Maybe the game is designed that way. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use a different verb, like "move south" instead of "go south". But the user's previous action was "go south" and it didn't work. So maybe the correct action is to go south again, even if it's the same room. Alternatively, maybe the user is in a loop and needs to find another way. But according to the instructions, the user needs to go south three times. So the next step is to go south again from Salon.

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. A typical one. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.



There is an unguarded exit to the north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.
