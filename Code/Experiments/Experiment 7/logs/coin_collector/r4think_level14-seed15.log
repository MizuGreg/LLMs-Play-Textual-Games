FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text adventure game and needs to follow a specific path to collect a coin and win. The goal is to navigate through different rooms by moving in certain directions and eventually pick up the coin in the lounge.

First, I need to recall the steps mentioned in the initial instruction. The user was told to go west, then north, east, north, north again, then venture north, west, west, west, then north, west, and finally pick up the coin. But the user is currently in the Pantry room, and the next step according to the previous actions was to go west. However, the response from the game says that in the Pantry, you should try going west. But the user's next move was to go east, which might have been a mistake.

Wait, looking back at the history: the user first went west from the shower to the workshop, then north to the playroom, then east to the pantry. Now, in the pantry, the game suggests going west. But the user's next action was to go east again, which might not be correct. However, the user's last action was "go east" in the pantry, which might not be the right direction. The game says in the pantry, you should go west. So maybe the user needs to go west from the pantry.

But according to the initial steps, after the pantry, the next steps were to go west, then west again, then west again, then north, then west, then head west, then pick up the coin. So perhaps the user is following the correct path. However, the current location is the pantry, and the next step is to go west. But the user's last action was "go east" which might have been a mistake. Wait, no. Let me check again.

Wait, the user's previous steps were: shower -> west to workshop, then north to playroom, then east to pantry. Now, in the pantry, the game says to go west. So the next step should be west. But the user's last action was "go east" which might have been a mistake. Wait, no. The user's last action was "go east" in the pantry, but according to the game's message, the correct direction is west. So maybe the user made a mistake here. But the user's next step should be to go west from the pantry. However, the user's last action was "go east", which might have been a wrong move. But according to the game's message, in the pantry, you should go west. So the correct next step is west. But the user's previous action was east, which might have been a loop. So the user needs to correct that.

But the user's current location is the pantry, and the game says to go west. So the next action should be "go west". However, the user's previous action was "go east", which might have been a mistake. But the user's next step should be to go west. So the correct next action is "go west".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in a text adventure game. The goal is to follow a specific sequence of movements to eventually pick up a coin in the lounge and win.

First, I need to recall the initial instructions. The user was told to go west, then north, east, north, north again, then venture north, west, west, west, then north, west, and finally pick up the coin. But the user is currently in the Pantry room, and the game is looping between the Playroom and Pantry.

Looking at the history, the user has been moving between these rooms, but seems to be stuck in a loop. The game messages suggest that in the Pantry, going west is the correct direction, but when they try, they end up back in the Playroom. Then, trying to go north from the Playroom isn't possible, so they go east again, back to the Pantry. This loop is preventing progress.

The user's past actions include going west, north, east, west, east, north, east, etc., which isn't following the initial path correctly. The next step should be to find a way out of this loop. Since the Pantry has an exit to the north, maybe that's the key. But when they tried going north from the Playroom, it wasn't possible. Wait, in the Pantry, the exit is to the north, so maybe from the Pantry, going north is the correct move. But earlier, when they were in the Playroom, they tried going north and couldn't. So perhaps the correct path is to go north from the Pantry, which leads to another room, maybe the Lounge where the coin is.

But the user's last action was going east from the Pantry, which led back to the Playroom. So the next step should be to go west from the Playroom, but that's not working. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go north from the Pantry. Let me check the game messages again.

In the Pantry, the message says: "There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west." Wait, that's conflicting. The game says to go west, but the exit is to the north. Maybe there's a mistake here. Or perhaps the user needs to go north from the Pantry. But the game is suggesting to go west. However, the user is stuck in a loop between Playroom and Pantry. So maybe the correct action is to go north from the Pantry, even though the game says to go west. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to find another way.

Alternatively, maybe the user should try going south from the Playroom, as the game mentions an exit to the south. But the initial instructions said to go north after the pantry. Hmm. This is confusing. The user needs to break the loop. Since going west from the Pantry leads back to the Playroom, and going east leads back to the Pantry, the correct move must be north from the Pantry. Even though the game says to go west, maybe that's a misdirection. So the next action should be to go north from the Pantry.

The goal is to follow a specific path: start by going west, then north, east, north, north again, then venture north, west, west, west, then north, west, and finally pick up the coin in the lounge.

Looking at the current situation, the user has been moving between the Salon, Dish-Pit, and Studio. They tried going north from the Dish-Pit, which led them to the Studio, then south back to the Dish-Pit. This seems like a loop between the Dish-Pit and Studio. The previous actions didn't progress towards the lounge, so the user needs to find a different path.

The user's past actions include moving north from the Pantry, then to the Salon, then to the Dish-Pit, Studio, and back. The next step should be to find an unguarded exit from the Dish-Pit. The game messages mention that from the Dish-Pit, you can go north or south. Since the user has been going back and forth between north and south, maybe they need to try a different direction, like west, which is mentioned as an unblocked exit in the Studio. But the user is currently in the Dish-Pit, so the options are north or south. However, the user might have missed an exit west from the Dish-Pit. Wait, the game says in the Dish-Pit: "You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south." So west isn't mentioned. But in the Studio, there's an unblocked exit to the west. Maybe the user needs to go west from the Studio. But the user is in the Dish-Pit now. So the correct next step is to go north from the Dish-Pit again, but that leads back to the Studio. Alternatively, maybe the user should go south from the Dish-Pit to the Pantry again. But the initial path required going north from the Pantry. This is confusing. The user is stuck in a loop between Dish-Pit and Studio. The key is to find the correct path to the Lounge. Since the user has already gone through the Pantry and Salon, maybe the next step is to go west from the Studio, which is unblocked. But the user is in the Dish-Pit. So the correct action is to go north from the Dish-Pit again, but that's not working. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go south from the Dish-Pit to the Pantry and then north again. But the user has already tried that. The loop is preventing progress. The user needs to break the loop by finding a different path. The answer is to go west from the Studio, but the user is in the Dish-Pit. So the next action should be to go north from the Dish-Pit again, even though it's looping. But the game might have a different exit. Alternatively, maybe the user should try going west from the Dish-Pit, even though the game says to go north or south. But the game didn't mention west. However, the user needs to break the loop, so maybe the correct action is to go west from the Studio, which is unblocked. But the user is in the Dish-Pit. So the next step is to go north from the Dish-Pit again, but that's not working. The user needs to find the correct path to the Lounge.

The goal is to follow a specific path: start by going west, then north, east, north, north again, then venture north, west, west, west, then north, west, and finally pick up the coin in the lounge.

They're now in the Restroom, and the game messages suggest going east or west. The user's previous actions have led them through a loop between the Laundromat and Restroom. The next step should be to find the correct path to the Lounge where the coin is.

The user's past actions include moving west from the Studio to the Laundromat, then west again to the Restroom. The game says in the Restroom to try going east or west. Since the user is in the Restroom, maybe the correct direction is east to exit to the Laundromat again, but that's not helping. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go north from the Restroom, but the game doesn't mention that. The key is to break the loop and find the correct path. The user needs to go east from the Restroom to the Laundromat and then find another exit. But the user has already tried that. The answer is to go east from the Restroom to exit the loop and proceed towards the Lounge.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's try to figure out the next step here. The user is stuck in a loop between the Laundromat and Studio. They've been going back and forth between these two rooms, trying different directions but not making progress towards the Lounge where the coin is. The goal is to follow the initial path: west, north, east, north, north, then north again, west, west, west, north, west, and finally pick up the coin.

Looking at the current situation, the user is in the Studio again. The game messages say to go south or west. The user has tried going west, which leads back to the Laundromat. The problem is that the user is stuck in a loop between these two rooms. The key is to find a different path that leads towards the Lounge. Since the initial path required going north from the Pantry, maybe the user needs to find a way to get to the Lounge from the Studio. But the Studio's exits are south and west. Wait, the user has already tried going west from the Studio to the Laundromat, which loops back. Maybe the correct path is to go south from the Studio to the Dish-Pit, then north to the Salon, then east to the Pantry, and then north to the Lounge. But the user hasn't tried that yet. However, the user is currently in the Studio, so the next step should be to go south to the Dish-Pit. But the game messages don't mention that. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west from the Studio again, but that's not working. The user needs to break the loop by trying a different direction. Since the user is in the Studio, maybe the correct action is to go south to the Dish-Pit, even though the game messages don't mention it. That might be the way to proceed.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.
