Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an fast paced round of TextWorld? You do! Here is your task for today. First of all, you could, like, try to venture north. After that, head east. That done, go to the east. Next, attempt to travel north. And then, travel west. That done, head south. With that accomplished, recover the coin from the floor of the steam room. And once you've done that, you win!
