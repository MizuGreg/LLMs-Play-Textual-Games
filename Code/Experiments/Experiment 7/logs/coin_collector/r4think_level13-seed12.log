THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user wants me to navigate through these different rooms and eventually retrieve the coin from the office. The current challenge is that I keep looping between the Launderette and Cubicle. Let me break this down.

First, the goal is to go west, then west again, then north, west, south, south, east, south, west, south, and finally get the coin. But so far, the steps have led me back and forth between the Launderette and Cubicle. 

Looking at the previous moves: I went west from the Vault to Cookhouse, then west again to Closet, then west to Launderette, then north to Cubicle, south back to Launderette, north again to Cubicle. So I'm stuck in a loop between those two rooms. 

The problem is that the directions are leading me in circles. Maybe I need to find a different path. The instructions mention trying synonyms or different actions if I'm in a loop. Instead of "go north" or "go south," maybe there's another way to move. But the game only allows movement in the directions indicated. 

Wait, in the Launderette, the exit is east or north. In the Cubicle, exits are south or west. So perhaps I need to find another route. Maybe I should try going east from the Launderette instead of north. Let me check the previous steps. 

When I was in the Launderette (step 6), the options were east or north. I went north to Cubicle, then south back. If I instead go east from Launderette, maybe that leads to a different room. But the user's instruction said to go west first, then west again, etc. Maybe I need to follow the original path but find a way out of the loop. 

Alternatively, maybe the coin is in the Cubicle. The user mentioned retrieving the coin from the floor of the office. Wait, the initial goal was to go to the west, then move west, venture west, north, west, south, south, east, south, west, south, then get the coin. But perhaps the coin is in the Cubicle or another room. 

But the current loop suggests that I'm not making progress. So the next step is to try a different direction. Instead of going north from the Launderette, maybe go east. Let me try that. So the next action should be "go east" from the Launderette. That might break the loop and lead to a new room where the coin is located.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to navigate through various rooms, following a specific sequence of directions, and eventually retrieve the coin from the office. So far, the path has taken them through the Vault, Cookhouse, Closet, Launderette, Cubicle, and now they're in the Shower. The current challenge is to find the coin, which is in the office, but the path seems to be looping between rooms.

Looking at the previous steps, the user has been moving west, then north, south, east, and now they're in the Shower. The next step according to the original plan was to go south again, but that led them back to the Cubicle. Now, in the Shower, the options are to go south or west. The user needs to find a way to reach the office without getting stuck in a loop.

The key here is to realize that the coin is in the office, which is likely connected to the initial west direction from the Vault. But the current path is taking them through the Shower, which might not be the right route. The user needs to find an alternative path that leads directly to the office. Since the original plan was to go west, then west again, maybe there's another way to get back to the office without looping.

The user has to avoid repeating the same actions that lead to the loop. Instead of going south from the Shower, they should try going west, which is unguarded. That might lead them back to the Cubicle or another room that connects to the office. Once they get to the office, they can retrieve the coin and win. So the next action should be to go west from the Shower to break the loop and proceed towards the office.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms to retrieve a coin from the office. The current loop is between the Shower, Bedroom, and Still Cubicle. The goal was to follow a specific sequence of directions: west, west, north, west, south, south, east, south, west, south, then get the coin.

But the user has been stuck in a loop between these rooms. The last few moves were going back and forth between the Shower and Bedroom. The key is to break this loop. The next step should be to find a way out of the loop and head towards the office. Since the original plan was to go west from the Vault, maybe there's another path that leads directly to the office without looping.

In the current situation, the user is in the Shower. The options are to go south or west. Going west might lead back to the Bedroom, which is part of the loop. But maybe going south from the Shower would take them to the Cubicle again. However, the user needs to avoid repeating the same actions. Instead of going south, perhaps they should try a different direction. Wait, the Shower's exit is south and west. If going west leads to the Bedroom, which is part of the loop, maybe the user needs to find another way. But the game might not have other exits. 

Alternatively, maybe the coin is in the Cubicle. The user needs to check there. But the previous attempts to go north from the Cubicle led back to the Still Cubicle. The user needs to find a way to get to the office. Since the original plan was to go west, then west again, maybe the office is connected to the initial west direction. But the user is stuck in a loop. The next action should be to go west from the Shower to break the loop and proceed towards the office. But the user has already done that. Hmm. Maybe the correct next step is to go south from the Shower to the Cubicle and then find another exit. But the user needs to avoid repeating the same actions. So, instead of going south, maybe they should try going west again. But that's what they did before. This is confusing. The key is to find the correct path to the office without looping. The answer is to go west from the Shower to break the loop and proceed towards the office.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Shower, Bedroom, and Still Cubicle. The goal is to retrieve the coin from the office. The previous steps have them moving back and forth between these rooms without making progress.

First, the goal is to follow the sequence: go west, then west again, north, west, south, south, east, south, west, south, then get the coin. But they've been looping instead of moving towards the office.

Second, the past actions have them going west, north, south, east, west, north, south, east, west, etc. Each time, they're not moving towards the office but staying in the loop. The next step should be to break the loop and find a different path.

Third, the loop is between the Shower and Bedroom. The user needs to try a different direction. Instead of going west or south, maybe they should go east from the Shower to escape the loop. But the game might not allow that. Alternatively, they need to find the office directly. Since the original plan was to go west from the Vault, maybe the office is connected to the initial west direction. But the user is stuck.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Shower, Bedroom, and Still Cubicle. The goal is to retrieve the coin from the office. The previous steps have them moving back and forth without progress.

First, the goal is to follow the sequence: go west, then west again, north, west, south, south, east, south, west, south, then get the coin. But they've been looping instead of moving towards the office.

Second, the past actions have them going west, north, south, east, west, north, south, east, west, etc. Each time, they're not moving towards the office but staying in the loop. The next step should be to break the loop and find a different path.

Third, the loop is between the Shower and Bedroom. The user needs to try a different direction. Instead of going west or south, maybe they should go east from the Shower to escape the loop. But the game might not allow that. Alternatively, they need to find the office directly. Since the original plan was to go west from the Vault, maybe the office is connected to the initial west direction. But the user is stuck. The correct next action is to go east from the Shower to break the loop and proceed towards the office.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to navigate through various rooms and retrieve the coin from the office. So far, they've been stuck in a loop between the Shower, Bedroom, and Cubicle. Now they're in the Workshop, which is a new room.

First, the goal steps are to go west, then west again, north, west, south, south, east, south, west, south, and then get the coin. But the user has been looping instead of moving towards the office. 

Second, the past actions have them moving west, north, south, east, west, north, south, east, west, etc. Now they're in the Workshop. The Workshop has exits to the east and west. The next step should be to go east to proceed towards the office. 

Third, the loop was between the Shower and Bedroom, but now they're in the Workshop. The user needs to go east from the Workshop to continue towards the office. Since the previous actions didn't break the loop, changing direction to east is necessary. So the next action is to go east.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Look at you, bigshot, walking into a studio like it isn't some huge deal.



There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.
