Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First stop, attempt to move south. With that done, attempt to go east. And then, take a trip north. Once you do that, make an effort to travel west. With that accomplished, take a trip west. Okay, and then, go to the north. And then, make an effort to move north. Then, pick up the coin from the floor of the cubicle. And if you do that, you're the winner!

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user wants me to figure out the next action in this text-based game. The goal is to pick up the coin from the cubicle. Let me recap the steps taken so far.

Starting in the Cookery, they went south to the Kitchen, then east to the Sauna, north to the Studio, west to the Office, west again to the Cookhouse, and then north to the Workshop. Now, in the Workshop, the description mentions an unblocked exit to the north and a suggestion to go south. The user has to find the coin in the cubicle. 

Wait, the previous steps have been moving around different rooms, but maybe they haven't found the cubicle yet. The current location is the Workshop. The next step might be to check the north or south. But the user needs to find the cubicle. Let me check the previous rooms. The Office had an exit east and west. The Cookhouse had an exit east and north. The Studio had a south exit. The Sauna had a west exit. The Kitchen had east and north. 

Maybe the cubicle is in one of these rooms. The user needs to explore further. The Workshop's north exit is unblocked. Let me check the Workshop's description again. It says there's an unblocked exit to the north and a suggestion to go south. Maybe going north from the Workshop would lead to another room where the cubicle is. Alternatively, maybe the cubicle is in the Workshop itself. But the user hasn't checked the rooms yet. 

Wait, the user's last action was going north to the Workshop. The next step would be to check the north or south. But the user needs to find the cubicle. Since the previous steps have been moving around, maybe the cubicle is in the north direction. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to look for the cubicle in the current room. But the instruction says to pick up the coin from the floor of the cubicle. So the user needs to find the cubicle first. 

In the Workshop, maybe there's a cubicle mentioned. But the description doesn't say that. The user has to explore further. The next step is to go north from the Workshop. Let me check the previous steps again. The user has been moving in a loop? Let me see: Cookery → Kitchen → Sauna → Studio → Office → Cookhouse → Workshop. From Workshop, going north or south. If the user goes north, maybe they reach a new room. If they go south, they might loop back. But the user needs to find the cubicle. 

Alternatively, maybe the cubicle is in the Office or Cookhouse. But the user hasn't checked those rooms yet. Wait, in the Office, the user was told to go east or west. Maybe the cubicle is in one of those directions. But the user hasn't explored those areas. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check the current room for the cubicle. But the description of the Workshop doesn't mention a cubicle. So perhaps the next step is to go north from the Workshop. Let me check the Workshop's description again. It says there's an unblocked exit to the north. So going north would be the next step. That's the next action.

-= Cubicle =-
Well how about that, you are in the place we're calling the cubicle.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

There is a coin on the floor.
