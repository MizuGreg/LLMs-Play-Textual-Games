I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! First, it would be fantastic if you could attempt to move south. With that done, attempt to go east. And then, take a trip north. Once you do that, make an effort to travel west. With that accomplished, take a trip west. Okay, and then, go to the north. And then, make an effort to move north. Then, try to travel east. After that, venture south. If you can get around to doing that, travel south. And then, go west. And then, pick-up the coin from the floor of the kitchen. And once you've done that, you win!

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to win this game. The user's goal is to pick up the coin from the kitchen floor and then win. So far, the player has moved through several rooms: Attic, Office, Studio, Cookhouse, Cookery, Workshop, Pantry, and back to the Pantry again. The last action was going south from the Vault back to the Pantry.

Looking at the current room, the Pantry, the description mentions an exit to the south and north. The player is probably stuck in a loop between the Pantry and Vault. The next step should be to check if the coin is in the kitchen. But the player hasn't visited the kitchen yet. The previous path didn't go east from the Pantry. The user's instruction said to go north from the Pantry, but maybe that's not the right direction. Wait, in the Pantry room, the exit to the north is unguarded, and the south is unblocked. Maybe the player needs to go east from the Pantry to reach the kitchen. But in the current state, the player is in the Pantry again after going south from the Vault. So the next action should be to go east from the Pantry to reach the kitchen where the coin is. But the current room's description doesn't mention an east exit. Wait, the user's last action was going south from the Vault to the Pantry. The Pantry's exits are north and south. So maybe the player needs to go north from the Pantry to the Vault again, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe the player needs to go east from the Pantry, but the description doesn't mention that. Wait, the user's previous steps might have missed a direction. Let me check the history again.

The user's path was: Attic -> Office -> Studio -> Cookhouse -> Cookery -> Workshop -> Pantry -> Vault -> Pantry. The Vault has an exit to the east and south. The Pantry has exits to north and south. The coin is in the kitchen, which hasn't been visited yet. So perhaps the player needs to go east from the Pantry to reach the kitchen. But the Pantry's description doesn't mention an east exit. Wait, maybe the player is in the Pantry, and the next step is to go east, but the game might not have that exit. Alternatively, maybe the player needs to go north from the Pantry to the Vault again, then east to the kitchen. But the Vault's exit to the east is unguarded. So from Vault, go east to reach the kitchen. But the player is currently in the Pantry. So the correct next step is to go north from the Pantry to the Vault, then east to the kitchen. But the user's last action was going south from the Vault to the Pantry. So the player is in the Pantry again. The next action should be to go north to the Vault, then east to the kitchen. But the user's current room is the Pantry, so the next command should be go north to the Vault. But the user might be in a loop between Pantry and Vault. Therefore, the next action is to go north from the Pantry to the Vault, then east to the kitchen. But the user's last action was going south from the Vault to the Pantry, so the next step is to go north again. However, that's the same as before. So maybe the player needs to find another way. Alternatively, maybe the player needs to go east from the Pantry, but that's not listed. Wait, the user's instruction said to go east from the Pantry. But in the current room, the Pantry's description says "You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the south." So the exits are north and south. Therefore, the player can't go east from the Pantry. So the player must have missed a step. The correct path is to go from the Pantry north to the Vault, then east to the kitchen. But the player is in the Pantry again. So the next action is to go north to the Vault, then east to the kitchen. But the user's last action was going south from the Vault to the Pantry. So the next step is to go north again. However, that's the same as before. Therefore, the player is in a loop. To break the loop, the player needs to try a different action. But the only exits are north and south. So maybe the player needs to go east from the Vault. Wait, the Vault's description says there's an exit to the east. So from the Vault, go east to reach the kitchen. But the player is in the Pantry. So the correct sequence is: from Pantry, go north to Vault, then east to the kitchen. Therefore, the next action is to go north from the Pantry to the Vault. But the user is in the Pantry, so the next command is "go north".
