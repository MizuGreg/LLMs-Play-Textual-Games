Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First thing I need you to do is to make an attempt to head east. Following that, make an attempt to venture south. Then, make an effort to take a trip south. And then, make an effort to travel south. If you can manage that, attempt to go east. Then, go to the south. Following that, attempt to take a trip west. And then, attempt to venture south. Next, travel east. And then, make an effort to move north. If you can finish that, venture east. And then, venture east. Then, make an attempt to take a trip north. Then, pick up the coin from the floor of the bedroom. Got that? Good!

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this. The user is in a text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and eventually pick up a coin in the bedroom. The initial instructions were to go east, then south three times, then east, south, east, north, and finally pick up the coin.

Looking at the current location, the user is in the Workshop. The previous steps were: Pantry > Bar > Workshop. The next steps according to the initial plan would be to go south from the Workshop, but the user has already tried going south once before. Wait, the user's past actions were: go east (Pantry to Bar), then go south (Bar to Workshop), then go south again (Workshop to somewhere else?), but maybe they're stuck in a loop.

Wait, the user is in the Workshop now. The description says there's an exit to the south and north. The previous steps might have led them to the Workshop, and if they keep going south, maybe they loop back. So the next step should be to go north from the Workshop instead of south to avoid the loop. Then, from there, proceed to the next steps as planned. The goal is to reach the bedroom and pick up the coin. So the next action should be to go north from the Workshop to break the loop and continue towards the bedroom.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Bar, Pantry, and Workshop. The goal is to reach the bedroom and pick up the coin. The previous actions have been going back and forth between these rooms without making progress.

First, the goal is to follow the initial plan: go east, then south three times, then east, south, east, north, and finally pick up the coin. But the user has been looping between the Bar and Pantry, which suggests they're not moving towards the bedroom.

Second, the past actions show that the user has been going east and west repeatedly, which is causing the loop. The next step should be to break this loop. Instead of going west again, maybe try going south from the Bar to proceed further.

Third, the Workshop has an exit to the south, so maybe going north from the Workshop isn't helping. The key is to find a path that leads towards the bedroom without looping. The next action should be to go south from the Bar to escape the loop and continue towards the bedroom.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is stuck in a loop between the Study and Cookery rooms, going back and forth by going south and north. The goal is to reach the bedroom and pick up the coin. The initial plan was to follow a specific path, but the user has been circling without progress.

First, the goal is to navigate through the rooms in the order specified: east, south three times, then east, south, east, north, and finally pick up the coin. But the current path is looping between Study and Cookery, so the user isn't moving towards the bedroom.

Second, the past actions show that the user has been going south from Study to Cookery and north back to Study, repeating the same steps. This loop isn't making progress towards the bedroom. The next step should be to break the loop by trying a different direction, like east from Cookery, which was mentioned as an exit.

Third, the Cookery room has an exit to the east. Instead of going north again, the user should try going east to proceed further. This would take them out of the loop and towards the bedroom. The previous actions of going north and south are not helping, so changing direction is necessary.

You've just shown up in a study. The room is well lit.



There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Study and Cookery rooms. They keep going south and north between them. The goal is to reach the bedroom and pick up the coin. The initial plan was to go east, then south three times, but they've deviated.

First, the goal is to follow the original path: east, south three times, then east, south, east, north, and finally pick up the coin. But the user has been looping between Study and Cookery, so they need to break that cycle.

Second, the past actions show that every time they try to go east from Cookery, it's not possible. The only exits are north and south. So the next step should be to find another way out. Maybe the Study has an exit to the north that wasn't considered before.

Third, the user is stuck in a loop between Study and Cookery. To break it, they need to try a different direction. The Study has an exit to the north, but that's been tried. Wait, maybe the Study's north exit leads to a different room that wasn't explored yet. Alternatively, maybe the Cookery's east exit is the key, but the user can't go that way. Wait, the user tried going east from Cookery and was told they can't. So maybe the correct path is to go north from Study again, but that just loops back. Hmm.

Wait, the original plan was to go east first. The user started in the Pantry, went east to Bar, then south to Workshop, then north back to Bar, then west to Pantry, etc. But the loop is forming between Study and Cookery. Maybe the correct path is to go east from Cookery when possible. But the user can't go east. Wait, the Cookery room says there's an exit to the east. Maybe the user just hasn't tried it again. Wait, the user tried go east from Cookery and was told they can't. Maybe there's a mistake here. Or perhaps the user needs to find another way.

Alternatively, maybe the Study's north exit leads to the bedroom. The user needs to go north from Study. But the user has been going south and north between the two rooms. The next step is to try going north from Study again, even though it loops, but maybe that's the only way to proceed. Or maybe the user needs to find another exit. But according to the current room descriptions, the Study has exits to north and south. The Cookery has exits to east and north. So the user needs to find a way to get to the bedroom from here. Maybe the Study's north exit is the key. Even though it loops, maybe that's the only way. So the next action is to go north from Study.

FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

You arrive in a pantry. A typical kind of place. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.



There is an unguarded exit to the east.

You are in a bar. A normal kind of place.



There is an unguarded exit to the south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.
