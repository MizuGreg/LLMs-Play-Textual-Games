Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First, it would be a great idea if you could make an effort to head west. With that done, move south. And then, head east. And then, move east. Next, make an attempt to venture east. Then, make an attempt to go to the east. Next, make an attempt to go north. And then, attempt to venture west. And then, make an attempt to move south. With that done, try to travel west. Next, try to head south. If you can get around to doing that, move south. Okay, and then, take a trip east. If you can finish that, pick-up the coin from the floor of the canteen. And once you've done that, you win!

FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through a text-based game. The goal is to follow a series of directions to reach a coin in the canteen and then pick it up to win. The current challenge is that the player is stuck in a loop between the Laundromat and Chamber, repeatedly going west and east.

First, I need to recall the original instructions. The user was told to go west, then south, east, east, east, north, west, south, south, and finally east to pick up the coin. But the game's environment is causing the player to loop between rooms, so the same actions aren't working.

Looking at the steps taken so far: the player went west, then east, then west again, leading back to the Laundromat. The chamber seems to be a loop where moving east or south is possible but not progressing towards the goal. The key is to find a path that leads to the canteen without getting stuck.

The next step should be to find an alternative direction. Since the player is in the Chamber, maybe trying to go north instead of east or south. But the original directions mentioned going north later. Alternatively, maybe the player needs to find a way to move east again but through a different path. However, the game's responses indicate that some directions are blocked or unguarded.

Wait, the user's previous actions were going west and east repeatedly. The problem is that the same directions are leading back to the same rooms. So, the player needs to try a different direction. Maybe the correct path requires moving north from the Chamber to reach a new area. The original instructions mentioned going north after several easts, so perhaps that's the key.

But the current position is in the Chamber. The available directions are east, south, and maybe north. The user needs to try moving north to break the loop. If that's not possible, maybe there's another way. However, the game's responses don't mention north being blocked, so trying north could be the next step. Alternatively, maybe the player needs to go south from the Chamber to reach a new area.

Wait, the original plan was to go west, then south, east, east, east, north, west, south, south, east. But the player is stuck in a loop between Laundromat and Chamber. So perhaps the correct path is to go south from the Chamber to reach a different room. Let me check the previous steps again.

In the first move, the player went west to the Laundromat. Then, the next instruction was to move south, but the game's response says that in the Chamber, moving south is unguarded. So maybe the player needs to go south from the Chamber. But when they tried that, they ended up back in the Laundromat. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the player needs to go east from the Chamber to reach a new area. But that's what they did before, leading back to the Laundromat. So perhaps the correct path is to go north from the Chamber. The original instructions said to go north after several easts, so maybe that's the right move now.

So the next action should be to go north from the Chamber. That would be the next step to break the loop and proceed towards the canteen.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text adventure game and needs to follow specific directions to reach a coin in the canteen and win. The current challenge is getting stuck between the Chamber and Studio, looping between them.

First, the goal is to follow the sequence: west, south, east, east, east, north, west, south, south, east, then pick up the coin. But the player is stuck in a loop between the Chamber and Studio. 

Looking at the steps taken so far: the player went west to the Laundromat, then east to the Chamber, then west back to Laundromat, then east to Chamber again. Now, in the Studio, they tried north but ended up back in the Chamber. So the loop is Chamber <--> Studio <--> Chamber.

The next step should be to find a way out of the loop. The previous attempt to go north from the Studio didn't work. Maybe trying a different direction from the Studio. The Studio has an exit to the east, which is unblocked. The original plan was to go east after some south moves, but maybe from the Studio, going east is the right move. Alternatively, since the user is in the Studio, maybe going east from there would lead to the next part of the path.

Wait, the user's previous action was going north from the Studio, which led back to the Chamber. So perhaps the correct direction from the Studio is east. The Studio's description says there's an exit to the east. So the next action should be to go east from the Studio to proceed further. That would break the loop and move towards the next part of the path.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text adventure game and needs to follow specific directions to reach a coin in the canteen and win. The current challenge is moving through different rooms without getting stuck in a loop.

First, the goal is to follow the sequence: west, south, east, east, east, north, west, south, south, east, then pick up the coin. The user has been moving between the Laundromat, Chamber, Studio, Bar, Scullery, and Cookhouse, always being told to go east or west. 

Looking at the steps taken so far: the user started by going west, then east, west, east, south, east, east, and now is in the Cookhouse. The next step in the original plan was to go north from the Cookhouse, but the game's responses don't mention that. Instead, the user is told to go east or west from the Cookhouse. 

The user is in the Cookhouse and needs to proceed. The original plan after the Cookhouse would be to go north, but since that's not an option, maybe the correct path is to go east again. However, the user has been going east repeatedly, which might be part of the loop. But the game's description says the Cookhouse has an exit to the east, so maybe that's the right direction. Alternatively, the user might need to go west from the Cookhouse to reach the next part of the path. 

Wait, the original instructions said after going east several times, the next step was to go north. But in the current scenario, the user is in the Cookhouse and needs to go north. However, the game's responses don't mention a north exit. So maybe the user needs to find another way. Alternatively, the user might have missed a step where going north is possible. 

But according to the current game state, the Cookhouse says to try going east or west. The user needs to choose one. Since the original plan was to go east after several south moves, maybe going east from the Cookhouse is the next step. However, the user has been going east repeatedly, leading to the same rooms. But maybe the Cookhouse is part of the path towards the canteen. 

The next action should be to go east from the Cookhouse to proceed further. That's the next step in the sequence, even if it's part of the loop. The user needs to continue moving east until they reach the canteen. So the next command is go east.

FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Attic and Kitchen, moving north and south repeatedly. The goal is to reach the canteen and pick up the coin. The original plan was to follow specific directions, but the user has been going back and forth between these two rooms.

First, the goal steps are: west, south, east, east, east, north, west, south, south, east, then pick up the coin. The user has already moved through several rooms, but is now stuck in a loop. The current position is the Kitchen, and the next step should be to go west, as the Kitchen has an unguarded exit to the west. But the user has been going south and north, which is causing the loop. So the next action should be to go west from the Kitchen to break the loop and proceed towards the canteen.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.
