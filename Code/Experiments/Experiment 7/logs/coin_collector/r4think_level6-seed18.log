Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an fast paced round of TextWorld? You do! Here is your task for today. First stop, venture north. And then, travel north. And then, venture east. Following that, attempt to go to the east. That done, go to the south. And then, retrieve the coin from the floor of the bathroom. That's it!

-= Cubicle =-
You are in a cubicle. A typical one. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.



There is an unguarded exit to the north.

Well, here we are in the study.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

Look around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a workshop. You start to take note of what's in the room.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let me try to figure out the next steps here. The user's goal is to retrieve the coin from the bathroom floor after following a series of directions: go north, then north again, then east, then east again, then south, and finally get the coin.

So far, the user has been moving through the cubicle, study, and workshop. The current location is the workshop. The directions mentioned after the workshop are to go east, then east again, then south. But the user is at the workshop, which has an unblocked exit to the south and an east entrance. 

Wait, the user's previous actions were: go north (from cubicle to study), go north again (study to workshop). Now, the next step according to the initial instructions is to venture east. The workshop has an east exit that's unblocked. So the next action should be to go east. But the user might be in a loop if they keep going back. However, the instructions say to go east twice, then south. So after going east from the workshop, they should go east again, then south. Then, after that, they need to find the bathroom and get the coin.

But the current location is the workshop. The next step is to go east. The user hasn't done that yet. So the next command should be "go east". But the user might have already done that? Wait, the initial instructions say after the workshop, attempt to go east. So the user is at the workshop, so the next step is to go east. Then, after that, go east again, then south. Then, find the bathroom. So the next action is "go east".

-= Studio =-
Well, here we are in the studio.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

-= Chamber =-
You are in a chamber.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

-= Bathroom =-
You've entered a bathroom. You begin to take stock of what's here.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked.

There is a coin on the floor.

Okay, let me break this down. The user's goal is to retrieve the coin from the bathroom floor. So far, they've followed the path: cubicle -> study -> workshop -> studio -> chamber -> bathroom. The coin is in the bathroom, so the next step is to pick it up.

Looking at the current location, the bathroom has a coin on the floor. The previous actions have already led them here. The next logical step is to pick up the coin. The command should be "take coin" or "get coin". Since the game might expect a specific verb, "take" is more likely. So the next action is to take the coin.
