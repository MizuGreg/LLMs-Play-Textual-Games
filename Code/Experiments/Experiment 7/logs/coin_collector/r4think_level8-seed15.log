I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to head west. Then, make an attempt to take a trip north. And then, make an attempt to head east. Then, make an effort to travel north. And then, go north. If you can get through with that, make an effort to venture north. Then, move west. With that done, pick-up the coin from the floor of the lounge. And once you've done that, you win!

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in TextWorld. The goal is to pick up a coin from the lounge and then win. The current situation is in the Kitchenette, and the user tried to go north again but couldn't.

First, I need to recall the steps mentioned in the initial instructions. The user had to go west, then north, then east, then north again, then west, pick up the coin, and win. But they seem to be looping between the Shower and Workshop, and then the Kitchenette.

In the current state, the user is in the Kitchenette. The available exits are east and south. The user tried to go north again, which isn't possible. So the next logical step is to check the other exits. Since the user is in the Kitchenette, maybe going south is the way to go. But wait, the initial plan was to go west, north, east, north, west, then pick up the coin. But they might have gotten stuck in a loop.

The user's previous actions were: go west (shower), then east (workshop), then west (shower again), then east (workshop), then north (kitchenette). Now they can't go north again. So maybe the next step is to go south from the kitchenette. But the original plan was to go north again. However, since that's not possible, perhaps the user needs to find another path. Alternatively, maybe there's a different route to reach the lounge where the coin is.

Wait, the coin is in the lounge. So the user needs to get to the lounge. The previous steps might have been going in circles. Maybe the correct path is to go east from the kitchenette (since there's an unguarded exit east). Then from the workshop, maybe go north again. But the user tried that before. Alternatively, maybe after getting to the kitchenette, going south to the workshop, then east to the shower, then west again? But that's the same loop.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go south from the kitchenette to the workshop, then east to the shower, then west to the workshop again, then north to the kitchenette. That's not helping. Hmm. Maybe the user needs to find a different path. Wait, the initial instructions said to go west, then north, then east, then north, then west, then pick up the coin. So perhaps after the kitchenette, the next step is to go south to the workshop, then east to the shower, then west to the workshop again, then north to the kitchenette again. But that's not making progress.

Wait, maybe the user is in the kitchenette, and the exit to the east is unguarded. So maybe going east from the kitchenette would take them to the workshop again. Then from the workshop, go north to the lounge? But the initial instructions said to go north from the workshop. But in the workshop, the user was told to go east or north. So maybe from the workshop, go north to the lounge. Then pick up the coin. But how to get there.

Wait, the user is in the kitchenette. The exits are east and south. So maybe go east to the workshop, then north to the lounge. Then pick up the coin. But the user tried going north from the kitchenette and couldn't. So maybe the correct path is to go east from the kitchenette to the workshop, then north to the lounge. Then pick up the coin. But the user's previous steps were looping between shower and workshop. So the next action should be to go east from the kitchenette.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to pick up the coin from the lounge and win. So far, they've been moving between rooms, but they seem to be stuck in a loop between the Playroom and Bedchamber. The previous actions were going north and south repeatedly, which isn't making progress.

First step: The goal is to reach the lounge, pick up the coin, and win. The user needs to find the correct path to the lounge.

Second step: The user has been moving between the Playroom and Bedchamber, going north and south. They haven't reached the lounge yet. The next step should be to find another exit or check if there's a different way to get to the lounge.

Third step: The user is in a loop. Instead of repeating the same actions, they need to try a different direction. The Bedchamber has a west exit. Maybe going west from the Bedchamber could lead to another room that's part of the path to the lounge. Alternatively, maybe there's a hidden exit or an object to interact with that wasn't mentioned before. But since the user is supposed to use commands like 'go west' or 'look', perhaps the next action should be to check the west direction from the Bedchamber.

So the next command should be 'go west' to break the loop and explore a new path.
