Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. Your first objective is to go to the east. Following that, attempt to go south. After that, retrieve the coin from the floor of the attic. That's it!

-= Study =-
You're now in a study. You begin to take stock of what's here.



There is an unblocked exit to the east.

-= Cubicle =-
Well, here we are in a cubicle.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text-based game where they need to follow specific steps. The first objective is to go east, then south, then retrieve a coin from the attic.

Looking at the current situation: The user started in the Study, went east to the Cubicle. Now, in the Cubicle, the prompt says they need an unguarded exit, suggesting they should try going south or west. But the user's next step should be to go south as per the initial goal.

Wait, the user's previous action was "go east", which took them to the Cubicle. Now, the next step according to the original plan is to go south. But the prompt here says that in the Cubicle, they should try south or west. So the next action should be "go south".

But the user might be in a loop if going south doesn't work. However, the prompt doesn't indicate a loop yet. The user hasn't retrieved the coin yet, so the next logical step is to go south. The answer should be "go south".

-= Attic =-
You've entered an attic. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked.

There is a coin on the floor.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game where they need to follow specific steps. The goal is to go east, then south, then get the coin from the attic.

First, the user started in the study, went east to the cubicle. Then they tried going south, which led them to the attic. Now, in the attic, they need to retrieve the coin. The prompt says there's a coin on the floor. So the next step is to pick it up. But the previous action was going south, which was part of the plan. Now they're in the attic, so the next logical step is to pick up the coin. The user might have already done that, but the game might require a specific command like 'take coin' or 'get coin'. Since the instruction says to retrieve the coin from the floor, the correct command would be to pick it up. So the next action should be 'take coin' or similar. But the system message says to output only the command, so I need to check if 'take coin' is the right command here. Alternatively, maybe 'get coin' is the correct verb. The game's environment mentions the coin is on the floor, so the player needs to pick it up. Therefore, the next action is to take the coin.
</think>take coin
