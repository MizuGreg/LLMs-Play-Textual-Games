Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. Your first objective is to go to the east. Following that, attempt to go south. After that, retrieve the coin from the floor of the attic. That's it!

-= Study =-
You're now in a study. You begin to take stock of what's here.



There is an unblocked exit to the east.
