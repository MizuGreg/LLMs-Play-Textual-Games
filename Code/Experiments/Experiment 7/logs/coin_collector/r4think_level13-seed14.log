THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and eventually recover a coin from a workshop. The goal is to follow a specific sequence of directions: east, east, north, north, west, south, west, north, north, east, then get the coin.

Looking at the current room, they're in the Laundromat. The exits are south (unguarded) and west (unblocked). The previous steps have them moving east from the Office to the Cellar, then to the Canteen, Bedroom, Parlor, and now Laundromat. The next step in the original plan was to go west from the Laundromat. But the user might be stuck in a loop if they keep repeating the same movements. 

Wait, the user's last action was "go north" from the Parlor to the Laundromat. Now, in the Laundromat, the next step according to the original plan was to go west. But if going west leads back to a previous room, that could create a loop. The user needs to check if moving west from the Laundromat is part of the path to the workshop. Alternatively, maybe they need to go south from the Laundromat instead of west. But the original plan said after Laundromat, go west. However, if that leads back, they need to find another way. 

But according to the initial instructions, after the Laundromat, the next steps were: go west, then north, then east, then get the coin. So maybe from the Laundromat, going west is correct. But the user might be in a loop if the west exit leads back to a previous room. However, the game's structure might have a path that eventually leads to the workshop. The key is to follow the steps as per the original plan, even if it seems repetitive. So the next action should be "go west" from the Laundromat. But if that's not working, maybe "go south" instead. But according to the original plan, after Laundromat, go west. So the next command is "go west".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in a text-based game to recover a coin from a workshop. The initial instructions had a specific sequence of directions: east, east, north, north, west, south, west, north, north, east, then get the coin.

Looking at the current state, the user is back in the Laundromat after going east from the Garage. The previous steps had them move from the Parlor to the Laundromat, then to the Garage, and now back to the Laundromat. This seems like a loop between the Laundromat and Garage. The original plan was to go west from the Laundromat, but that led to the Garage, and then going east back to Laundromat. So they're stuck in a loop between these two rooms.

The goal is to break this loop. The next step according to the original plan was to go west from the Laundromat, but that's leading back. Maybe the user needs to try a different direction instead of west. The Laundromat has an exit to the south and west. Since west is leading back, maybe going south from the Laundromat is the way to go. But according to the original plan, after Laundromat, they should go west. However, since that's causing a loop, the user needs to find another path. Perhaps the south exit leads to a different room that's part of the workshop path. So the next action should be to go south instead of west to break the loop.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is trying to navigate through a series of rooms to find a coin in a workshop. The goal is to follow a specific path: east, east, north, north, west, south, west, north, north, east, then get the coin.

Looking at the current room, the user is in the Bedroom. The exits are east and south. Previously, they came from the Parlor via west, then to the Bedroom. The next step in the original plan was to go east from the Bedroom. But if that leads back to the Parlor, which was already visited, maybe there's a loop. However, the original plan says after Bedroom, go east. So maybe the next step is to go east again. But the user needs to check if that's part of the path to the workshop. Alternatively, if going east leads back, maybe they need to go south instead. But according to the plan, after Bedroom, the next step is east. So the next action should be east.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.
