Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is how to play! First step, make an attempt to venture west. Then, travel west. If you can accomplish that, head south. With that over with, lift the coin from the floor of the basement. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Laundry Place =-
You arrive in a laundry place. An ordinary kind of place. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

-= Cubicle =-
You arrive in a cubicle. A typical kind of place. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

You've entered a garage.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to win this game. The user mentioned that the goal is to pick up a coin from the basement and put it in a place, but the instructions are a bit confusing. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the initial steps were moving west from the laundry place into a cubicle, then west again into a garage. Now, the current location is the garage. The user's previous actions were going west twice. The next step according to the initial instructions was to go south after moving west. But in the garage, the user is told there's an exit to the south. So maybe the next step is to go south from the garage.

Wait, the original plan was: venture west, then travel west again, then head south. But after moving west twice, the user is in the garage. The garage has a south exit. So going south from the garage would be the next step. Then, once in the next room, perhaps the basement, the user can pick up the coin. But the user needs to check if the basement is the next room. Also, the user needs to collect the coin and put it in a place. But the original instruction says to lift the coin from the basement and that would make them the winner. So the key is to get to the basement, pick up the coin, and maybe put it somewhere, but the exact steps are unclear.

Wait, the initial message said: "lift the coin from the floor of the basement. And if you do that, you're the winner!" So the main action is picking up the coin in the basement. So the path is: start in laundry place, go west to cubicle, west again to garage, then south to basement. Then pick up the coin. But the user is currently in the garage. The garage has a south exit, so going south would take them to the basement. Then, in the basement, pick up the coin. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next step is to go south from the garage to the basement. Then, in the basement, pick up the coin. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action should be to go south.
</think>go south

-= Basement =-
If you're wondering why everything seems so usual all of a sudden, it's because you've just walked into the basement. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.



There is an unblocked exit to the north.

There is a coin on the floor.
