Welcome to another profound round of TextWorld! First thing I need you to do is to make an attempt to venture west. Then, travel west. If you can accomplish that, head south. With that over with, make an effort to move south. Then, attempt to head west. And then, move south. That done, pick-up the coin from the floor of the kitchen. That's it!

-= Laundry Place =-
You arrive in a laundry place. A normal one. You begin to take stock of what's here.



You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Cubicle =-
I am sorry to announce that you are now in the cubicle.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

-= Garage =-
You have stumbled into the most usual of all possible garages. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.



There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is in a text-based game called TextWorld, and their goal is to pick up a coin from the kitchen. The current environment is a garage with exits to the east and south. Let me break down the steps they've taken so far.

First, they started in the Laundry Place, then went west to the Cubicle, and then west again to the Garage. Now, they're in the Garage, which has exits to the east and south. The original instructions said to venture west, then west again, then south, then south again, and finally pick up the coin in the kitchen.

Wait, but the user's last action was going west from the Cubicle to the Garage. Now, in the Garage, the exits are east and south. The next step according to the initial plan was to go south from the Garage. But the user might be stuck in a loop if they keep going west again. Let me check the previous steps again.

The initial plan was: go west (from Laundry to Cubicle), then west again (to Garage), then south (from Garage to maybe another area), then south again, then pick up the coin. But in the Garage, the exits are east and south. So going south from the Garage would be the next step. However, the user might have already tried going west again, which leads back to the Cubicle, creating a loop. So the next action should be to go south from the Garage. But the user's last action was going west, which might not be the right move now. The user needs to go south from the Garage to proceed further. So the correct next step is to go south.
</think>go south

-= Closet =-
Look around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a closet. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.



There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the south.



>                                                                                                                                -= Closet =-0/4

-= Basement =-
You find yourself in a basement. An ordinary kind of place. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.



There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the west.



>                                                                                                                                -= Basement =-0/5

Well, here we are in the cookhouse.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is in a text adventure game and needs to pick up a coin from the kitchen. The current location is the Cookhouse, which has exits to the east and south. Let me recap the steps taken so far.

Starting from the Laundry Place, they went west to the Cubicle, then west again to the Garage. From there, they went south to the Closet, then south again to the Basement, then west to the Cookhouse. The original plan was to go west, then west, then south, then south, then pick up the coin. But now they're in the Cookhouse. The next step according to the plan should be to go south from the Cookhouse. But the user might be stuck in a loop if they keep going west again. Wait, the Cookhouse has a south exit. So going south from Cookhouse would be the next step. The user's last action was going west, which might not be the right move now. The correct next action is to go south from the Cookhouse to proceed towards the kitchen. So the next command should be 'go south'.
