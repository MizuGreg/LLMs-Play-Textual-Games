THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in a TextWorld game and needs to follow a specific path to pick up a coin in a garage. Let me recap the steps they need to take.

First, the initial instructions say to go north, then again to the north, then east, then north again, west, north, then west again, south, east, and finally pick up the coin. But the user has already gone through several rooms: Scullery, Launderette, Cubicle, Study, Salon, Shower, Chamber, Playroom, Bar, Basement, Sauna. Now they're in the Sauna, and the next step according to the original plan was to go north from the Sauna to reach the garage.

Wait, the Sauna's description says there's an exit to the east (unguarded) and a suggestion to go north. So maybe the next step is to go north from the Sauna. But the user has to make sure they're not looping. Let me check the previous steps. The user went from Sauna to... wait, the last action was going south from the Basement to the Sauna. Now, in the Sauna, the exit to the north is unguarded. So going north from Sauna should lead to the next room, perhaps the garage. But the user needs to pick up the coin in the garage. So the next action should be going north from Sauna. But the user might have already done that. Wait, the original plan says after going west from the Bar to the Basement, then south to Sauna, then north. So the next step is go north from Sauna. But the user is in Sauna now. So the next command is go north. But the user needs to check if that's the correct path. Alternatively, maybe the garage is east from Sauna? Wait, the Sauna's description says exit to the east is unguarded. But the original plan says after the Sauna, the next step is to go east to pick up the coin. Wait, no, the original plan says after going south from the Basement to Sauna, then attempt to go east. Wait, the original instructions said: "After that, make an attempt to go east. After that, pick-up the coin from the floor of the garage."

So in the Sauna, the user needs to go east to reach the garage. Because the Sauna's east exit is unguarded. So the next step is go east. But the user is in Sauna, and the exit to the east is there. So the correct next action is go east. But the user might have missed that. Let me check the Sauna's description again. The Sauna says: "There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north." Wait, so the user is told to try going north, but the east exit is also unguarded. So maybe the user should go east first. But the original plan says after Sauna, go east. So the next action is go east. But the user is in Sauna, and the east exit is available. So the correct next step is go east to reach the garage where the coin is. Therefore, the next command is go east.
