Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an exciting round of TextWorld? You do! Here is your task for today. First of all, you could, like, make an effort to head west. With that done, move south. And then, head east. And then, move east. Next, make an attempt to venture east. Then, pick up the coin from the floor of the studio. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Laundromat =-
You are in a laundromat. A typical kind of place. The room is well lit.



There is an unguarded exit to the west.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through a text-based game set in a laundromat and a chamber. The goal is to follow specific movements and pick up a coin to win.

First, the initial steps mentioned were: go west, then south, then east, east again, then venture east to pick up the coin. But the user ended up in a loop between the laundromat and chamber.

Looking at the current state: after going west again, they're back in the laundromat. The previous attempts to go south were blocked. So the user is stuck in a loop between the laundromat and chamber. The next step should be to find another way out or a different direction. Since the chamber has an exit to the south, maybe trying to go east again from the chamber? Wait, but the user was in the laundromat again. Maybe they need to find the coin first. But the coin is in the studio, which might be accessible through the chamber. Alternatively, maybe the correct path is to go east from the chamber, then south, then east again to reach the studio where the coin is. But the user needs to avoid the loop. The key is to not repeat the same actions. So instead of going west again, maybe try a different direction from the chamber. Wait, the chamber has an exit to the south, which is unguarded. So perhaps from the chamber, go south, then east to reach the studio. But the user was in the laundromat again. Maybe the correct sequence is: from the chamber, go south to the laundromat, then east to the studio. But the user needs to pick up the coin. So the next action should be to go east from the chamber, then south, then east again to reach the studio and pick up the coin. But the user is currently in the laundromat again. So the next step is to go east from the laundromat to the chamber, then south to the laundromat again? That's not helpful. Wait, maybe the user needs to go east from the chamber to the studio. But the user is in the laundromat. So the correct path is: from the chamber, go east to the studio, then pick up the coin. But how to get to the studio? The initial steps said to go west, then south, then east, east, then east again. But the user is stuck. The problem is that after going west, they're back in the laundromat, and can't go south. So maybe the correct next step is to go east from the chamber, then south to the laundromat, then east again to the studio. But the user needs to avoid the loop. So the next action should be to go east from the chamber, then south, then east to reach the studio where the coin is. But the user is in the laundromat again. So the next command should be to go east from the laundromat to the chamber, then south to the laundromat again? That's not working. Wait, maybe the user needs to go east from the chamber to the studio. So the next action is to go east from the chamber.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is stuck in a loop between the Laundromat and Chamber. The goal is to follow specific movements: west, south, east, east, east, then pick up the coin.

Past actions: They went west, then south (but couldn't), then east, west again, and back to the Laundromat. Now they're stuck trying to go south again, which isn't possible. So they're in a loop between the two rooms.

The next step should be to find another way out. Since the Chamber has an exit to the south, maybe they should go east from the Chamber to reach the studio where the coin is. But the user is in the Laundromat again. So the correct action is to go east from the Chamber to the studio, then pick up the coin. But the user needs to avoid repeating the same actions. The previous attempt to go east from the Laundromat didn't work, so maybe try a different direction from the Chamber, like south, then east to the studio.

You are in a chamber. A standard kind of place. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Laundromat and Chamber. The goal is to follow specific movements: go west, then south, then east, east, east, then pick up the coin.

Past actions: They've been going back and forth between west and east, ending up back where they started. The problem is that after going west, they can't go south, so they loop between the two rooms.

The next step should be to find another way out. Since the Chamber has an exit to the south, maybe they should go east from the Chamber to reach the studio where the coin is. But the user is in the Laundromat again. So the correct action is to go east from the Chamber to the studio, then pick up the coin. But the user needs to avoid repeating the same actions. The previous attempt to go east from the Laundromat didn't work, so maybe try a different direction from the Chamber, like south, then east to the studio.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.
