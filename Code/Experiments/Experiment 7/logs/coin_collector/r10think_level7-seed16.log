THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to win this game. The user's goal is to retrieve the coin from the canteen and then win. The current path seems to be looping between the Cubicle and Kitchenette. Let me check the steps taken so far.

Starting from the Steam Room, the user went west to the Studio, then south to the Dish-Pit, east to the Cubicle, then east again to the Kitchenette, and then back and forth between Cubicle and Kitchenette. The problem is that the user is stuck in a loop between these two rooms. The original instructions mentioned moving west, south, east, then east again, then north, and then getting the coin. But the current path isn't moving north yet.

Wait, the user hasn't tried going north from the Kitchenette. The Kitchenette has an exit to the east and a suggestion to go west. But maybe there's a way to go north from here. However, the description of the Kitchenette doesn't mention a north exit. The previous rooms had exits in different directions, but maybe the user needs to find the canteen first. The coin is in the canteen's floor, so the user needs to reach the canteen.

Looking at the path: from the Kitchenette, going west leads back to the Cubicle, which loops again. The user needs to find a way to get to the canteen. Maybe the canteen is in a different direction. Wait, the initial instructions said after moving west, south, east, then east again, then north. But the user hasn't tried going north yet. However, in the current position (Kitchenette), there's no north exit mentioned. Maybe the user needs to go east from the Kitchenette to the next room, which might be the canteen.

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go north from the Cubicle. The Cubicle has an exit to the east and west. But the user has been going east and west repeatedly. Maybe the correct path is to go north from the Kitchenette, but the description doesn't mention it. Wait, the user is in the Kitchenette, and the description says there's an exit to the east and suggests going west. Maybe the canteen is east of the Kitchenette. Let me check the previous steps again.

The user was in the Kitchenette (step 9), and the previous steps were looping between Cubicle and Kitchenette. The user needs to break the loop. Since going east and west is causing the loop, maybe the user should try a different action. But the instructions say to go north after moving east. However, the user hasn't reached the point where they can go north yet. Maybe the user needs to go east from the Kitchenette to reach the canteen. But the Kitchenette's exit to the east is unblocked. So, going east from Kitchenette (step 9) would take the user to the next room, which might be the canteen. Then, once there, they can retrieve the coin.

Wait, the original task mentioned going north after moving east. But perhaps the user is supposed to go east from the Kitchenette to reach the canteen, then go north from there. Alternatively, maybe the canteen is in the north direction of the Kitchenette. But the description doesn't mention that. The user needs to find the canteen's floor where the coin is. Since the user is stuck in a loop, the next step is to try going east from the Kitchenette to proceed further. That's the next action.

-= Pantry =-
You arrive in a pantry. An usual one. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."



There is an unguarded exit to the north. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.
