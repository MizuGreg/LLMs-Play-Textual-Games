Welcome to another life changing episode of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First of all, go to the west. Then, make an attempt to move west. Next, venture west. And then, venture north. If you can finish that, lift the coin from the floor of the study. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Vault =-
Well, here we are in a vault.



You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

-= Cookhouse =-
You're now in a cookhouse. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

You find yourself in a closet. A standard one.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Workshop =-
You've just sauntered into a workshop. The room is well lit.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked.

You are in a study. A normal one. Let's see what's in here.



There is an unguarded exit to the south.

There is a coin on the floor.

That's not a verb I recognise.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in the Study room. The goal is to lift the coin from the floor. The previous action was "lift coin", but the system said that's not a recognized verb. So I need to figure out the correct way to pick up the coin.

First, the goal is to lift the coin. The user is in the Study, which has an unguarded exit to the south and a coin on the floor. The mistake was using "lift", which isn't a valid command here. Maybe the correct verb is "take" or "pick up". But the game might expect a specific term. Let me check the previous interactions. The user tried "lift", which was rejected. So perhaps the correct command is "take coin" or "get coin". Alternatively, maybe "pick up coin". But since the game's response was that "lift" isn't recognized, the user needs to use a different verb. The next step is to use "take" instead of "lift". So the correct action should be "take coin".
