THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and eventually pick up a coin. The goal is to follow the steps given in the initial prompt.

First, the user has already moved north from the cubicle to the shower, then to the laundromat, and then to the playroom. From the playroom, they went east to the chamber. Now, in the chamber, the exits are north and west. The next step according to the initial instructions was to move north again. But the user might be stuck in a loop if they keep going back and forth between rooms without making progress towards the coin.

Looking at the current room (chamber), the next step should be to go north. However, if that leads back to a previous room, it might create a loop. The user needs to check if moving north from the chamber is part of the loop. If so, maybe they need to try a different direction, like west, but the initial instructions said to go north again. But the user has to follow the exact steps given. The next step after the chamber is to go north, then west, then south, etc. So the next action should be go north.

So far, they've gone through cubicle, shower, laundromat, playroom, chamber, pantry, bar, basement, and now scullery. The next step according to the initial plan was to go south from the scullery, but the user has to check if that's part of the loop.

Wait, the user is in the scullery. The instructions said after the basement, go south, then east, then south again, then east, then pick up the coin. But the user is now in the scullery. The exits here are south and west. The previous steps might have led them in a loop between the basement and scullery. So instead of going west again, they should try going south. But the user has to make sure they're not repeating the same action. The next action should be go south from the scullery. Let me check the previous steps. The user was told to go south from the scullery, so that's the next step.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a loop between the Basement and Bar rooms. They've been going back and forth between these two areas. The goal is to pick up the coin in the salon, but the current path isn't progressing towards that.

First, the goal is to follow the steps: after the basement, go south to the scullery, then east to the salon, pick up the coin. But the user is stuck in a loop between basement and bar. The previous actions were going west from the bar to the basement, then east from the basement to the bar again. That's not moving forward.

So, the next step should be to find another exit. In the basement, the instructions say to try going east or north. The user tried east, which led back to the bar. Maybe they need to go north from the basement. The bar's exit is south and west, but the basement has east and north. Going north from the basement might lead to a new area. Let's check the previous steps. The user was told to go north from the basement after the scullery. So the next action should be go north.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through these rooms to pick up the coin. The goal is to follow the steps given in the initial instructions. So far, they've gone through several rooms, including the cubicle, shower, laundromat, playroom, chamber, pantry, bar, basement, scullery, launderette, sauna, and now the garage. They're in the study now.

The next step according to the initial plan was to go east from the study. The study has exits to the east and north. The user needs to check if moving east leads them closer to the salon where the coin is. Since the previous steps involved moving south and east, the next logical step is to go east from the study. But wait, the user has to make sure they're not looping. The study's east exit might lead to the salon, which is the next step. So the next action should be go east.

I never took you for the sort of person who would show up in a salon, but I guess I was wrong. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."
