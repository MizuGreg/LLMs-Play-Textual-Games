Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First step, go south. Next, make an attempt to venture east. And then, pick up the coin from the floor of the dish-pit. Got that? Good!

-= Washroom =-
You've entered a washroom.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

-= Lounge =-
Well, here we are in a lounge. Let's see what's in here.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text-based game where they need to follow specific steps to reach the goal. The current environment is the Lounge, and they've already gone south from the Washroom. The next step mentioned was to venture east. But the user's previous action was "go south", which was the first step. Now, they're in the Lounge, and the prompt says to try going east next.

Looking at the task again: the first step was to go south, then attempt to go east, then pick up the coin from the dish-pit. The user has already done the first two steps: went south to the Lounge, then the next step was to go east. But the user's last action was "go south", which might be a repetition. Wait, no—the initial instruction said first step is go south, then next is attempt to venture east. So after going south to the Lounge, the next step is to go east. But the user's last action was "go south", which was the first step. So maybe they haven't yet gone east. Wait, the user's history shows that after entering the Lounge, the next instruction is to try going east. So the next action should be "go east". But the user's last action was "go south", which was the first step. So the next step is to go east. However, the user might be in a loop if going east doesn't make progress. But according to the current environment description, the Lounge has an exit to the north and suggests trying east. So the correct next step is to go east. The user needs to go east from the Lounge. The previous action was "go south", which was the first step. So the next step is "go east".
</think>go east

-= Dish-Pit =-
You are in a dish-pit. A typical one.



There is an unblocked exit to the west.

There is a coin on the floor.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Dish-Pit room. The goal is to pick up the coin from the floor of the dish-pit. The previous steps were going south from the Washroom, then east to the Lounge, and now they're in the Dish-Pit. The next step according to the initial instructions was to pick up the coin.

Looking at the current room description, there's a coin on the floor. So the next action should be to pick it up. The user hasn't done that yet. The previous actions were moving south and east, which were part of the initial steps. Now, the remaining step is to pick up the coin. There's no mention of a loop here because the coin is present and the exit is unblocked. So the correct command is to pick up the coin.
</think>pick up the coin
