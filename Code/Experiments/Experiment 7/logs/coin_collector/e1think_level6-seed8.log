Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First off, go to the east. Following that, attempt to go south. After that, take a trip east. Then, attempt to move east. Okay, and then, make an attempt to go north. Once you manage that, retrieve the coin from the floor of the bedroom. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Study =-
I am sorry to announce that you are now in the study. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east.

You're now in a cubicle. You begin to take stock of what's here.



There is an unblocked exit to the south. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text-based game where they need to follow specific movement steps and collect a coin. The current environment is the Cubicle, and the user has already gone east from the Study. The next steps according to the original instructions were to go south, then east again, then east again, then north. But in the current state, the user is in the Cubicle, which has an unblocked exit to the south and a possible west exit.

First, the goal is to reach the bedroom, retrieve the coin, and win. The user has already taken the first step by going east from the Study to the Cubicle. The next step in the original plan was to go south from the Cubicle. But the user is told that there's an unblocked exit to the south, so that's the next logical move. However, the user might be in a loop if they keep moving back and forth. But since the Cubicle's south exit is unblocked, going south would be the correct next step. The user needs to proceed south to continue towards the bedroom. So the next action should be to go south.

-= Office =-
Well, here we are in the office.



There is an unblocked exit to the east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in TextWorld to complete the task. The goal is to go east, then south, then east again, then try to move east again, then north. After that, retrieve the coin from the bedroom.

So far, the user started by going east from the study, which took them to the cubicle. Then they went south from the cubicle to the office. Now, in the office, the next step according to the initial instructions was to attempt to go east again. But the user's last action was going south, which might have been part of the sequence. Wait, the initial steps were: go east, then south, then east, then east again, then north. So after going east from the study to the cubicle, then south to the office, the next step should be going east again from the office. But the user's last action was going south, which might have been part of the initial steps. Wait, maybe I need to check the steps again.

The user's past actions: first, go east (study to cubicle), then go south (cubicle to office). The next step in the original plan was to take a trip east (from office?), then attempt to move east again, then north. So in the office, the next step should be going east. But the user's last action was going south, which was part of the initial steps. Wait, maybe the user is confused. Let me retrace.

Original task: First, go east. Then attempt to go south. Then take a trip east. Then attempt to move east. Then go north. Then get the coin.

So the sequence is: East (study to cubicle), then South (cubicle to office), then East (office to maybe another room?), then East again (if possible), then North, then get coin.

In the current state, the user is in the office. The previous action was going south from the cubicle to the office. Now, the next step should be going east from the office. But the user's last action was going south, so the next step is to go east. However, the user's last input was "go south", which might have been part of the initial steps. Wait, the user's last action was "go south" leading to the office. Now, the next step is to go east from the office. So the next command should be "go east". But the user's previous action was going south, so maybe they need to go east now. The user's current location is the office, and the exit to the east is unblocked. So the next step is to go east. Then, after that, perhaps try to go east again, then north. Then find the coin in the bedroom.

So the next action is "go east" from the office. That's the next step in the sequence. The user hasn't yet reached the bedroom, so they need to navigate through the rooms. The previous steps have been east, south, and now east again. Then, after that, maybe another east, then north. Then retrieve the coin.

So the next command is "go east".

-= Attic =-
You're not going to believe this, but you've just entered an attic.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and complete specific tasks. The goal is to eventually retrieve a coin from the bedroom and win the game.

First, I need to recall the original instructions. The user was told to go east, then south, then east again, then try to move east again, then north. After that, get the coin from the bedroom. So far, the user has moved through the study, cubicle, office, and attic. The current location is the attic, and the previous actions were going east from the office to the attic.

Looking at the current room (attic), the exits mentioned are east and west. The user's next step according to the original plan was to attempt to move east again. But maybe they're stuck in a loop? Let me check the steps again.

Wait, the user's past actions: started in study, went east to cubicle, then south to office, then east to attic. The next step in the original plan was to try moving east again from the attic. But the attic's east exit is unguarded, so maybe that's the next step. However, the user might be repeating actions without progress. But according to the current room's description, the attic has an east exit and a west exit. The user was told to go east again, so maybe that's the next step. But the user might be in a loop if they keep moving east and west. However, the original plan says after the attic, they need to go north to get the coin. Wait, no, the original plan was after moving east, then north, then get the coin. But the current location is the attic. So maybe the next step is to go west back to the office, then north? Or east again?

Wait, the original instructions said: go east, then south, then east, then east again, then north. So after the attic, maybe the next step is to go north from the attic? But the attic's description says the east exit is unguarded, and west is unblocked. So perhaps the user needs to go west back to the office, then north to reach the bedroom. But the user's next action should be to go east again from the attic. However, the user might be in a loop if they keep moving east and west. But according to the original plan, after the attic, they need to go north. Wait, maybe the user is supposed to go north from the attic. But the attic's description says the west exit is unblocked. So maybe the user should go west to the office, then north to the bedroom. But the original plan said after moving east, then north. So perhaps the user needs to go north from the attic. But the attic's description doesn't mention a north exit. So maybe the user needs to go west to the office, then north. Let me check the previous steps again.

The user's path so far: study (east) → cubicle (south) → office (east) → attic (east). Now, from the attic, the options are east or west. The original plan was to go east again, then north. But if the user goes east from the attic, they might be moving towards the next room. However, the user might be stuck in a loop if they keep moving east and west. But according to the game's current state, the attic has an east exit. So the next step is to go east again. But the user might be repeating actions. However, the original plan says after the attic, they need to go north. So perhaps the user needs to go west back to the office, then north. But the user's next action should be to go east again. However, the user might be in a loop. But the current room's description says the east exit is unguarded. So the next action is to go east. But the user might be in a loop if they keep moving east and west. However, the original plan says after the attic, go north. So maybe the user needs to go west to the office, then north. But the user's next action should be to go east again. But the user might be in a loop. However, the current step is to go east again. So the next action is go east.

-= Recreation Zone =-
You find yourself in a recreation zone. A standard kind of place. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in TextWorld to complete a series of steps. The goal is to eventually retrieve a coin from the bedroom and win the game.

First, I need to recall the original instructions. The user was told to go east, then south, then east again, then try to move east again, then north. After that, get the coin from the bedroom. So far, the user has moved through the study, cubicle, office, attic, and now the recreation zone. 

Looking at the current location, the Recreation Zone has exits to north and west. The previous actions have been going east multiple times, but now they're in a new area. The user needs to proceed towards the bedroom. The next step might be to go north or west. But since the goal is to get to the bedroom, maybe the bedroom is in a different direction. However, the user hasn't found the bedroom yet.

Wait, the original task mentioned going east, then south, then east, then east again, then north. But the user has already gone east from the study to the cubicle, then east to the office, then east to the attic, then east again to the recreation zone. Now, the next step in the original plan was to go north after attempting to go east again. But in the recreation zone, the exits are north and west. So maybe the next step is to go north from here. But the user needs to check if that leads them closer to the bedroom. Alternatively, maybe the bedroom is in the west direction from the recreation zone. But the user hasn't explored that yet.

However, the user's previous actions have been going east repeatedly, and now they're in the recreation zone. The next step according to the original plan was to go north after trying to go east again. But in the recreation zone, going north is an option. So the next action should be to go north. But the user might be stuck in a loop if they keep going east. However, the current room has a north exit, so going north makes sense. Therefore, the next command should be "go north".

You are in a bedroom. An ordinary one.



You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a coin on the floor.

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to follow a series of movements and then pick up the coin in the bedroom. So far, they've gone east from the study, then south to the cubicle, east to the office, east to the attic, east to the recreation zone, and then north to the bedroom. Now they're in the bedroom, which is the final destination mentioned in the task.

The next step according to the original instructions was to retrieve the coin from the floor of the bedroom. The user hasn't done that yet. The current room is the bedroom, and there's a coin on the floor. So the next action should be to pick up the coin. The previous actions have all been about moving through the rooms, and now the final step is to interact with the coin. Since the task says "retrieve the coin from the floor of the bedroom," the correct command here is to take the coin. There's no loop here because each movement led to the next room, and now they're in the correct room to pick up the coin. So the next action is to take the coin.
