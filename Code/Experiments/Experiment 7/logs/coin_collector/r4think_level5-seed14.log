THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a TextWorld game and needs to navigate through different rooms to retrieve a coin and exit. The goal is to find the coin in the Chamber and then get out.

First, the current room is the Chamber. The user has already gone through the Office, Cellar, Workshop, and Canteen. The next step was going east from the Canteen, which led to the Chamber. In the Chamber, there's a coin on the floor and an exit to the west. The user's next move should be to pick up the coin. But the game might have a loop if the user just keeps moving between rooms without achieving the goal. Since the coin is in the Chamber, the user needs to collect it. After that, they can exit west. But the user has to make sure they don't get stuck in a loop. The previous actions have led them to the Chamber, so the next step is to pick up the coin. Then, exit west to leave. The user should check if they've already done that. Since the coin is there, picking it up is the next step.
