Welcome to another exciting episode of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. Your first objective is to go to the north. And then, go to the east. With that over with, try to head south. After that, make an effort to head east. And then, make an attempt to go north. Then, take a trip west. Then, try to venture south. Then, make an attempt to move south. Following that, take a trip south. That done, pick up the coin from the floor of the dish-pit. Got that? Good!

-= Garage =-
You've entered an usual room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be usual. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the garage. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is in a text-based game where they have to navigate through different rooms and eventually pick up a coin. The current room is the Chamber, and the previous actions have been moving between the Garage, Kitchenette, Study, and Chamber repeatedly.

The user's goal is to go north, then east, then south, east, north, west, south, south, pick up the coin from the dish-pit. But so far, they've been moving between the Study and Chamber rooms, going back and forth between them. Each time they go north from the Chamber, they end up in the Study again, and then going south takes them back to the Chamber. This seems like a loop.

So the first step is to restate the goal: go north, then east, then south, east, north, west, south, south, then pick up the coin. But the user has only managed to go north and south between the Study and Chamber. The next step after the last action (go north) was back to the Study, and then going south again to the Chamber. So they're stuck in a loop between these two rooms.

The user needs to break the loop. Since the previous actions of going north and south are leading them in circles, maybe they need to try a different direction. But the Chamber only has an exit to the east and north. The Study has exits to south and west. Wait, maybe the coin is in the dish-pit, which is in the Kitchenette? The initial description mentioned a dish-pit. But the user hasn't checked there yet.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east from the Chamber. The Chamber has an exit to the east. The previous attempts to go north from the Chamber just loop back. So perhaps the next step is to go east from the Chamber. That way, they can move to a new room and maybe find the coin or proceed further.

So the next action should be to go east from the Chamber. That's the next step after the loop. The user has been stuck in the loop between Study and Chamber, so going east from the Chamber would be the break. Let me check the previous steps again. The last action was go north from Chamber to Study, then go south back to Chamber. So now, instead of going north again, go east. That should take them to a new room, maybe the Kitchenette or another area where the coin is located.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is stuck in a loop between the Study and Chamber rooms. The goal is to navigate through several directions: north, east, south, east, north, west, south, south, and then pick up the coin.

Looking at the history, the user has been moving back and forth between the Study and Chamber. Every time they go north from the Chamber, they end up in the Study, and going south from the Study takes them back to the Chamber. This loop is preventing progress.

The next step should be to break the loop. Since the previous actions of going north and south are causing the loop, maybe trying a different direction. But the Chamber has an exit to the east. Earlier, when the user was in the Cookhouse, they went east, but that led to the Bedroom. However, the user hasn't checked the east exit from the Chamber yet. 

Wait, in the current state, the user is in the Chamber again. The Chamber has an exit to the east. The previous attempt to go east was in the Cookhouse, but maybe from the Chamber, going east is a new path. The user needs to try going east from the Chamber to proceed further and possibly find the coin in the dish-pit. 

So the next action should be to go east from the Chamber. That's the key to breaking the loop and moving towards the coin.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Study and Chamber rooms. The goal is to navigate through several directions and pick up the coin. The previous actions have been going back and forth between these two rooms, which isn't making progress.

First, I need to restate the goal. The user needs to go north, then east, south, east, north, west, south, south, and then pick up the coin. So far, they've done some of the north and south movements but haven't moved east or west properly.

Looking at the history, every time they try to go north from the Chamber, they end up in the Study, and going south from the Study takes them back. The exit to the east in the Chamber was tried earlier but led to the Cookhouse and then Bedroom. Maybe the coin is in the dish-pit, which is in the Kitchenette, but the user hasn't checked there yet.

The user is currently in the Chamber again. The Chamber has an exit to the east, which was previously used but led to other rooms. Maybe the coin is in the Chamber itself, but the description doesn't mention it. Alternatively, the dish-pit might be in the Cookhouse or Bedroom.

Since the user is looping between Study and Chamber, the next step is to break the loop. The previous action was going north again, which caused the loop. Instead of going north, maybe try going west from the Study. The Study has a west exit. Wait, the Study's exit is to the west, so going west from the Study would take them back to the Chamber. But that's the same as before.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east from the Chamber again. The Chamber's east exit was used before, leading to Cookhouse. But perhaps from Cookhouse, there's a way to get to the Kitchenette or dish-pit. The Cookhouse has a north and west exit. Going north from Cookhouse leads to Bedroom, and west leads back to Chamber. Maybe the dish-pit is in the Cookhouse, but the user hasn't checked there.

The user's next action should be to go east from the Chamber again, but that's what they did before. Alternatively, maybe the coin is in the Chamber, and the user needs to look around. But the game's descriptions don't mention the coin in the Chamber. The coin is in the dish-pit, which is in the Kitchenette. The user needs to get to the Kitchenette.

So, the user needs to find a way to get to the Kitchenette. The previous path went through Cookhouse, Bedroom, but maybe from the Cookhouse, going west back to Chamber isn't helpful. Alternatively, from the Study, going west to Chamber, then east to Cookhouse, then north to Bedroom, then south back to Cookhouse, then west to Chamber... this is the same loop.

Wait, the user needs to go east from the Chamber once more. Maybe after several attempts, the user can find the correct path. But the game is stuck in a loop, so the user needs to try a different approach. Maybe the coin is in the Chamber, and the user needs to check there. But the game's description of the Chamber doesn't mention the coin. The coin is in the dish-pit, which is in the Kitchenette. So the user needs to get to the Kitchenette.

The user is in the Chamber. The Chamber has an exit to the east (Cookhouse). From Cookhouse, there's an exit to the west (Chamber) and north (Bedroom). The Bedroom has an exit to the south (Cookhouse) and west. Maybe the user needs to go from Cookhouse to the west again, but that's the same as before.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go from the Study to the west (Chamber), then east to Cookhouse, then north to Bedroom, then west back to Cookhouse, then south to Study, then west to Chamber... this is the same loop.

The user is stuck. The next step is to try a different direction. Since the user is in the Chamber, the exit to the east was tried. Maybe the user needs to go west from the Study. But that's the same as before. Alternatively, the user needs to find another way to get to the Kitchenette.

Wait, the initial instruction said to go to the north, then east, then south, etc. The user has done some of these steps but is stuck. The coin is in the dish-pit, which is in the Kitchenette. The user needs to get to the Kitchenette. The Kitchenette was mentioned earlier as a room with an exit to the south. Maybe the user needs to go from the Cookhouse to the south, but the Cookhouse's exit to the south isn't mentioned. Wait, the Cookhouse's description says there's an exit to the west and north. The Kitchenette is a separate room. Maybe the user needs to go from the Chamber to the east (Cookhouse), then from Cookhouse to the west (Chamber) again, but that's not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go from the Study to the west (Chamber), then east to Cookhouse, then north to Bedroom, then south to Cookhouse, then west to Chamber, then east to Cookhouse... this is the same loop.

The user is stuck in a loop between Study, Chamber, Cookhouse, and Bedroom. The only way out is to find the Kitchenette. But how? The user hasn't checked the Kitchenette yet. Maybe the user needs to go from the Cookhouse to the south, but that's not an exit. The Cookhouse's exits are north and west. The Kitchenette is a separate room. Maybe the user needs to go from the Chamber to the east (Cookhouse), then from Cookhouse to the west (Chamber) again, but that's not helpful.

The user needs to break the loop. The previous actions of going north and south are causing the loop. The next step is to try a different direction. Since the Chamber has an exit to the east, maybe the user should go east again, but that's what they did before. Alternatively, the user needs to go west from the Study. But that's the same as before.

Wait, the user is in the Chamber. The Chamber has an exit to the east. The user tried going east before, leading to Cookhouse. From Cookhouse, going west leads back to Chamber. Maybe the user needs to go from Cookhouse to the north (Bedroom), then from Bedroom to the south (Cookhouse), then from Cookhouse to the west (Chamber), then from Chamber to the east (Cookhouse)... this is the same loop.

The user is stuck. The next step is to try a different action. Since the user is in the Chamber, the exit to the east was tried. Maybe the user needs to go west from the Study. But that's the same as before. Alternatively, the user needs to go south from the Study to the Chamber, then east to Cookhouse, then north to Bedroom, then west to Cookhouse, then south to Study... this is the same loop.

The user needs to find a way to get to the Kitchenette. The only way is to go from the Chamber to the east (Cookhouse), then from Cookhouse to the west (Chamber) again. This is not working. Maybe the user needs to go from the Study to the west (Chamber), then east to Cookhouse, then north to Bedroom, then west to Cookhouse, then south to Study, then west to Chamber... this is the same loop.

The user is stuck. The next action should be to go east from the Chamber again, but that's what they did before. Alternatively, the user needs to find another way. Maybe the coin is in the Chamber, and the user needs to check there. But the game's description doesn't mention the coin in the Chamber. The coin is in the dish-pit, which is in the Kitchenette. The user needs to get to the Kitchenette.

The user is in the Chamber. The Chamber has an exit to the east (Cookhouse). From Cookhouse, there's an exit to the west (Chamber) and north (Bedroom). The Bedroom has an exit to the south (Cookhouse) and west. The user needs to find a way to get to the Kitchenette. Maybe the user needs to go from the Cookhouse to the south, but that's not an exit. The Cookhouse's exits are north and west.

This is a loop. The user needs to break it. The next action is to go east from the Chamber again, but that's not working. Alternatively, the user needs to go west from the Study. But that's the same as before. The user is stuck, so the next step is to try a different action, even if it's the same as before, but the game might have a different path.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Study and Chamber rooms. The goal is to navigate through several directions and pick up the coin. The previous actions have been going back and forth between these two rooms, which isn't making progress.

First, I need to restate the goal. The user needs to go north, then east, south, east, north, west, south, south, and then pick up the coin. So far, they've done some of the north and south movements but haven't moved east or west properly.

Looking at the history, every time they try to go north from the Chamber, they end up in the Study, and going south from the Study takes them back. The exit to the east in the Chamber was tried earlier but led to the Cookhouse and then Bedroom. Maybe the coin is in the dish-pit, which is in the Kitchenette, but the user hasn't checked there yet.

The user is currently in the Chamber again. The Chamber has an exit to the east, which was previously used but led to other rooms. Maybe the coin is in the Chamber itself, but the game's descriptions don't mention it. The coin is in the dish-pit, which is in the Kitchenette. The user needs to get to the Kitchenette.

Since the user is looping between Study and Chamber, the next step is to break the loop. The previous action was going north again, which caused the loop. Instead of going north, maybe try going west from the Study. The Study has a west exit. Wait, the Study's exit is to the west, so going west from the Study would take them back to the Chamber. But that's the same as before.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east from the Chamber again. The Chamber's east exit was used before, leading to Cookhouse. But perhaps from Cookhouse, there's a way to get to the Kitchenette. The Cookhouse has an exit to the west (Chamber) and north (Bedroom). The Bedroom has an exit to the south (Cookhouse) and west. The user needs to find a way to get to the Kitchenette. Maybe the user needs to go from the Cookhouse to the south, but that's not an exit. The Cookhouse's exits are north and west.

The user is stuck. The next step is to try a different direction. Since the user is in the Chamber, the exit to the east was tried. Maybe the user needs to go west from the Study. But that's the same as before. The user needs to break the loop by trying a different action, even if it's the same as before, but the game might have a different path.

You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.
