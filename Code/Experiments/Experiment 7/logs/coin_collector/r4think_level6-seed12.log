You are now playing a fast paced episode of TextWorld! First stop, go to the west. Then, make an attempt to move west. Next, venture west. And then, venture north. If you can finish that, attempt to go west. And then, pick up the coin from the floor of the launderette. That's it!

I just think it's awesome that you're in a closet now. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and eventually pick up a coin in a launderette. The current location is the Workshop. The goal is to follow the path: go west, then west again, then north, then west once more, and finally pick up the coin.

Looking at the previous steps, the user has already gone west three times, ending up in the Workshop. The next step according to the initial instructions was to venture north. But in the current state, the user is in the Workshop, and the available exits are east and north. The prompt says to try going north. However, the user might be stuck in a loop if moving north doesn't lead them closer to the coin.

Wait, the user's last action was going west again, which led them to the Workshop. The next step was supposed to be north. But the current room's description mentions that north is unblocked. So maybe the user needs to go north from the Workshop. But the initial plan was to go west, west, north, then west again. But after three wests, they're in the Workshop. So perhaps the next step is north, then west again. But the user might be repeating the same actions, leading to a loop. So maybe instead of going west again, they need to go north first, then west. Let me check the room descriptions again.

In the Workshop, the exits are east (unguarded) and north (unblocked). So going north from the Workshop would be the next step. Then, from the north room, maybe there's a way west to reach the launderette. The coin is in the launderette's floor, so the user needs to get there. The initial plan was to go west, west, north, west. But after three wests, they're in the Workshop. So perhaps after going north from the Workshop, then west again to reach the launderette. But the user might be stuck in a loop if they keep going west. So the next action should be north, then west. But the user's last action was west again, which might not be the right step. So the correct next action is to go north from the Workshop.

There is an unguarded exit to the south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Launderette, and there's a coin on the floor. The goal is to pick up the coin. But the previous steps show that the user is looping between the Study and Launderette. They went west from the Study to the Launderette, then east back to the Study, and this is repeating.

First step: The goal is to pick up the coin in the Launderette. The user needs to collect it.

Second step: The user has already been to the Launderette and tried going east, which brings them back to the Study. They need to pick up the coin once they're in the Launderette. But since they're looping, they need to stay in the Launderette long enough to pick it up.

Third step: The loop is between Study and Launderette. The user needs to stay in the Launderette. Instead of going east again, maybe they should look for the coin and pick it up. But the game might require them to pick it up once they're in the room. Since the coin is on the floor, the next action should be to pick it up. But the previous commands were moving directions. Wait, the user is in the Launderette, and the coin is there. So the correct action is to pick up the coin. But the game might require the user to pick it up after being in the room. So the next action is to pick up the coin.
