Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First thing I need you to do is to make an effort to head west. With that done, move south. And then, head east. And then, move east. Next, make an attempt to venture east. Then, make an attempt to go to the east. Next, make an attempt to go north. And then, lift the coin from the floor of the cookhouse. That's it!

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let me try to figure out what to do next. The user's goal is to head west, then south, east, east, east, north, and lift the coin from the cookhouse. So far, they've gone west, then south, then north. Wait, no, looking back: the first step was go west, then go south, then in the closet, the user tried going east and north. But the current location is the closet. The next step according to the original task was after going east, east, east, then north. But maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, the initial instructions said: first head west, then move south, then east, then east, then venture east, then go north. Then lift the coin. So after going west, south, then in the closet, the next steps would be to go east (from the closet). But the user is in the closet now. The closet has exits to east and north. The original plan was to go east, east, east, then north. So maybe from the closet, go east again. But the user is in the closet, and the previous action was going north? Or was it going east?

Wait, the user's last action was in the closet, and the prompt says "You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked." So the user is in the closet. The next step according to the original plan is to go east, then east, then east, then north. But the user has already gone west, south, then maybe north? Or maybe the user is in the closet and needs to go east again. Let me check the steps again.

Original task: head west, then south, then east, then east, then east, then north. Then lift the coin. So after going west and south, the user is in the closet. Then the next step is to go east (from the closet). Then from there, maybe another east, then another east, then north. But the user is in the closet now. So the next action should be go east. But the user might be in a loop if they keep going back. Wait, the current location is the closet. The exits are east and north. If the user goes east from the closet, they might enter a new room. Then from there, maybe go east again, then north. But the user needs to make sure they don't loop. So the next action is to go east from the closet. But the user might have already tried that. Wait, the user's previous action was in the closet, and the prompt says "You don't like doors? Why not try going east..." So the user needs to go east. Then after that, maybe go east again, then north. But the user's next step is to go east. So the answer should be "go east".

Okay, let's break this down. The user's goal is to navigate through the TextWorld environment by moving in specific directions and then picking up a coin. The steps mentioned are: go west, south, east, east, east, north, then lift the coin from the cookhouse.

So far, the user has gone west, then south, then east (from the closet), then east again (into the canteen), and then east again (into the bar). Now, the current location is the bar. The next step in the original plan was to go north after moving east three times. But in the bar, the exits are east and west. The prompt says there's an unblocked exit to the east and a west exit. Wait, the user is in the bar, and the previous steps were moving east three times. The original plan was after moving east three times, go north. But in the bar, going north might not be possible. Wait, maybe the user is in the bar, and the next step is to go west to avoid looping. Because if they keep going east, they might be stuck. So the user needs to go west from the bar to return to the canteen, then proceed north. But the original plan was to go north after three easts. Hmm, maybe the user is in the bar, and the next step is to go west to get back to the canteen, then go north. But the original plan says after three easts, go north. So perhaps the user is in the bar, and the next step is to go north. But the bar's exits are east and west. Wait, the prompt says "You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west." So maybe the user is supposed to go west from the bar. But the original plan was to go north. So there's a discrepancy here. The user might be in a loop if they keep going east. So the correct action here is to go west to avoid looping and proceed towards the north as per the original plan. Therefore, the next action should be go west.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Closet and Canteen. The goal is to navigate through specific directions and pick up the coin. The original plan was to go west, south, east, east, east, north, then lift the coin. But the user is repeatedly moving between the Closet and Canteen without progressing.

First, the goal steps: head west, south, east, east, east, north, then lift the coin. So far, the user has gone west, south, east (closet), then east (canteen), west (closet), east (canteen), west (closet). It seems they're stuck in a loop between the closet and canteen. The next step should be to find a way to go north from the canteen, but the user can't. So maybe the correct path is to go west from the closet to the canteen, then try north again. But since that's not working, perhaps the user needs to find another exit. Wait, in the canteen, there's an exit to the east and west. Maybe the user needs to go east from the canteen to the bar again, then find a way north from there. But the bar's exit is west. Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go north from the closet, but the closet has an unblocked north exit. Wait, in the closet, the prompt says "You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked." So maybe the user should go north from the closet. But earlier, when they tried going north from the canteen, it didn't work. But from the closet, going north might be possible. So the next action should be go north from the closet. That's the correct step to break the loop.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.
