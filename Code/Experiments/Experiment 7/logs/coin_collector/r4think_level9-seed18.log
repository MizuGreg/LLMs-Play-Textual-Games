THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing a text-based game where they have to navigate through different rooms and eventually reach the sauna to pick up the coin. The goal is to follow the sequence of directions given in the initial prompt.

First, I need to recap the game's objective. The user was told to venture north, then north again, then east, then east, then south, then west, then north, then north again, and finally pick up the coin in the sauna. So the main goal is to navigate through the rooms in that specific order to reach the sauna and collect the coin.

Looking at the user's current position, they are in the Study room. The previous actions taken were: North (from Bathroom to Office), North again (to Workshop), East (to Studio), East again (to Chamber), South (to Cubicle), West (to Study). Now, the next step according to the initial instructions was to venture north again. But the user is in the Study room, and the available exits are East and North. The next step in the original plan was to go north from the Study to reach the next room, which should be the sauna. However, the user hasn't picked up the coin yet, so they need to check if they're in the correct room.

Wait, the initial instructions said after going north twice from the Study, they should pick up the coin in the sauna. But the user is currently in the Study. So the next step is to go north from the Study to reach the sauna. But the user hasn't done that yet. However, in the current room (Study), the available exits are East and North. The user needs to go north to reach the sauna. But the user's previous action was going west to the Study, so now they need to go north from the Study. But the initial plan said after going north twice from the Study, but maybe the sequence is different. Let me check the steps again.

Original steps: After the initial movements, the user was supposed to go north, north, east, east, south, west, north, north, then pick up the coin. But the user's current position is Study (step 7). The next step according to the initial plan was to go north again from the Study. But the user hasn't done that yet. However, the user is in the Study, and the next step is to go north to reach the sauna. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action should be to go north from the Study to reach the sauna, then pick up the coin. But the user hasn't done that yet. However, the user's last action was going west to the Study, so the next step is to go north from the Study. But the user's previous steps might have already taken them to the sauna. Wait, maybe the user is in the Study, and the next step is to go north to reach the sauna. So the correct next action is to go north.
