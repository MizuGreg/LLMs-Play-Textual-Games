THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the closet and the cubicle. They keep going south and north, which is why the same messages repeat. The goal is to pick up the coin in the sauna, but they haven't found the way there yet.

First, I need to figure out the correct path. The initial instructions mentioned going south, then west, then south again, and so on. But the user is just moving back and forth between the closet and cubicle. Maybe they need to find another direction that's not been tried yet.

Looking at the environment, the closet has a south exit, and the cubicle has a north and south. But the user hasn't tried east or west in the cubicle. Wait, in the cubicle, the prompt says there's an unguarded exit to the south, but maybe there's also a west exit? The user tried going west earlier but maybe didn't proceed far enough.

Alternatively, maybe the correct path is to go west from the cubicle. The initial instructions said after going south, attempt to go west. But the user kept going north and south. So perhaps the next step is to try going west from the cubicle instead of north again.

The user is in the cubicle again, so the next action should be to go west. That way, they can move towards the sauna. The loop is because they're just switching between the two rooms without moving east or west. So the key is to try a different direction, like west, to break the loop and proceed towards the sauna.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Canteen, Spare Room, and Dish-Pit. They keep going back and forth between these areas. The goal is to pick up the coin in the sauna, but they haven't found the right path yet.

First, I need to figure out the correct sequence of moves. The initial instructions mentioned going south, then west, then south again, and so on. But the user has been moving between the Canteen and Spare Room, maybe missing the west exit somewhere.

Looking at the current position, the user is in the Spare Room again. The prompt says there's an exit to the north and west. They tried going west before, but maybe they need to go north from the Spare Room instead of south. Wait, the previous steps showed that going north from the Dish-Pit leads back to the Canteen, which then loops back. So maybe the key is to find a different exit that wasn't tried yet.

The user hasn't tried going east from the Canteen, but the prompt says there's an exit to the east. However, the user kept going south, which leads to the Dish-Pit. Maybe the correct path is to go east from the Canteen to reach the sauna. But the user hasn't tried that yet. Wait, in the Canteen, the exits are east and south. The user kept going south, but maybe the east exit is the way to go. However, the user's previous actions were repetitive, so they might be stuck in a loop. The answer is to try a different direction, like east, to break the loop and proceed towards the sauna.

SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Canteen, Spare Room, and Dish-Pit. They keep going back and forth between these areas. The goal is to pick up the coin in the sauna, but they haven't found the right path yet.

First, I need to figure out the correct sequence of moves. The initial instructions mentioned going south, then west, then south again, and so on. But the user has been moving between the Canteen and Spare Room, maybe missing the west exit somewhere.

Looking at the current position, the user is in the Spare Room again. The prompt says there's an exit to the north and west. They tried going west before, but maybe they need to go north from the Spare Room instead of south. Wait, the previous steps showed that going north from the Dish-Pit leads back to the Canteen, which then loops back. So maybe the key is to find a different exit that wasn't tried yet.

The user hasn't tried going east from the Canteen, but the prompt says there's an exit to the east. However, the user's previous actions were repetitive, so they might be stuck in a loop. The answer is to try a different direction, like east, to break the loop and proceed towards the sauna.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

<think>
Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Canteen, Spare Room, and Dish-Pit. They keep going back and forth between these areas. The goal is to pick up the coin in the sauna, but they haven't found the right path yet.

First, I need to figure out the correct sequence of moves. The initial instructions mentioned going south, then west, then south again, and so on. But the user has been moving between the Canteen and Spare Room, maybe missing the west exit somewhere.

Looking at the current position, the user is in the Spare Room again. The prompt says there's an exit to the north and west. They tried going west before, but maybe they need to go north from the Spare Room instead of south. Wait, the previous steps showed that going north from the Dish-Pit leads back to the Canteen, which then loops back. So maybe the key is to find a different exit that wasn't tried yet.

The user hasn't tried going east from the Canteen, but the prompt says there's an exit to the east. However, the user's previous actions were repetitive, so they might be stuck in a loop. The answer is to try a different direction, like east, to break the loop and proceed towards the sauna.

THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Canteen, Spare Room, and Dish-Pit. They keep going back and forth between these areas. The goal is to pick up the coin in the sauna, but they haven't found the right path yet.

First, I need to figure out the correct sequence of moves. The initial instructions mentioned going south, then west, then south again, and so on. But the user has been moving between the Canteen and Spare Room, maybe missing the west exit somewhere.

Looking at the current position, the user is in the Spare Room again. The prompt says there's an exit to the north and west. They tried going west before, but maybe they need to go north from the Spare Room instead of south. Wait, the previous steps showed that going north from the Dish-Pit leads back to the Canteen, which then loops back. So maybe the key is to find a different exit that wasn't tried yet.

The user hasn't tried going east from the Canteen, but the prompt says there's an exit to the east. However, the user's previous actions were repetitive, so they might be stuck in a loop. The answer is to try a different direction, like east, to break the loop and proceed towards the sauna.
