THINK about how to win the game, but be concise and brief in 3 steps.
FIRST STEP: State the goal of the game again, step by step.
SECOND STEP: State your past actions so far. Which steps of the goal have you already taken? And what is the next step?
THIRD STEP: Recognize if you find yourself in a loop. Your most important goal is to break the loop: if the previous actions didn't make any progress you have to say a different action, maybe by using a synonym. It is fundamental that you do NOT repeat the same action if it's not being recognized.
FINALLY, say your next action as a short command. Only output the command, nothing else.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Sauna and Kitchen. The goal is to eventually pick up the coin and win. The instructions mention moving in specific directions multiple times, but it seems like the game is trapping them between two rooms.

First, I need to retrace the steps. The user started by going north from the Sauna to the Kitchen. Then they went south back to Sauna, repeated this back and forth. The problem is that the game is forcing them to keep moving between these two rooms without making progress. 

The next step according to the original task was to go east after reaching the Kitchen, but the user hasn't done that yet. Wait, the initial instructions said after going north, head east. But in the current state, the user is in the Kitchen again. Maybe the user needs to go east from the Kitchen instead of south. But the prompt says there's an unguarded exit to the east in the Kitchen. So maybe the user should go east instead of south. 

But the user kept going south, which brings them back to Sauna. So the loop is Sauna -> Kitchen -> Sauna -> Kitchen. To break this, the user needs to take a different action. Instead of going south from the Kitchen, they should go east. That way, they can move to a new room and proceed towards the coin.

So the next action should be 'go east' from the Kitchen. That's the next step in the original plan. The user has been repeating north and south, but the next step was to go east. So changing the direction here will break the loop and move forward.

Okay, let's break this down. The user needs to follow a specific sequence of movements to reach the coin and win. The initial steps were moving north, then east, then north again, west, south, west, north, west, and then pick up the coin. But the user is stuck in a loop between the Sauna and Kitchen, so they need to find a different path.

Looking at the current position, the user is in the Workshop. The exits here are south and west. The previous steps had the user moving back and forth, but now they need to proceed towards the coin. The next step after the Workshop would be to go west, as that's the unguarded exit mentioned. Then, after moving west, they might reach a room with the coin. But the user has to make sure they don't loop again. The key is to follow the exact steps given in the task, ensuring each direction is correctly taken without repeating failed actions. The next command should be to go west from the Workshop.
