Welcome to TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, you could, like, open the chest drawer. Then, pick up the old key from the chest drawer. After picking up the old key, assure that the wooden door is unlocked. Then, ensure that the wooden door is open. After pulling open the wooden door, take a trip east. And then, make sure that the screen door is wide open. After that, make an effort to move east. With that done, attempt to take a trip south. Then, pick-up the bell pepper from the floor of the garden. And then, attempt to go to the north. If you can succeed at that, make an effort to take a trip west. And then, rest the bell pepper on the stove. Got that? Good!

-= Bedroom =-
You are in a bedroom. A standard kind of place.

You can make out a chest drawer. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You see a closed antique trunk close by. Look over there! a king-size bed. The king-size bed appears to be empty.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me see. The user is playing this text-based game, and they've followed the steps correctly so far. They opened the chest drawer, picked up the old key, unlocked the wooden door, and now the door is unlocked. The next step according to the original task was to ensure the wooden door is open. So after unlocking, they need to open it.

Wait, the user just unlocked the door, but the next instruction says to "ensure that the wooden door is open." So maybe they need to push it open. The current state is that the door is unlocked but maybe not open. So the next action should be to open the door. The user's last action was unlocking, so the next step is to open it. Then, after opening, they have to go east, then check the screen door, etc. So the correct next command here is to open the wooden door.

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. A standard one.

You see a refrigerator. You check the price tag that's still affixed to the refrigerator. 100 bucks? What a deal! You'll have to ask where they got this! You see a counter. The counter is typical. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. Look over there! a kitchen island. You wonder idly who left that here. The kitchen island is usual. On the kitchen island you see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

Okay, the user tried to say "make sure the screen door is wide open" but the system said that's not a recognized verb. So I need to figure out the correct command. The current location is the Kitchen, and the task is to make sure the screen door is wide open. The user has to interact with the screen door.

Looking at the previous actions, the user unlocked and opened the wooden door. Now, the screen door is closed, and the user needs to open it. The possible commands here might be "open screen door" or "push screen door". Since the user's previous action was "open the wooden door", which worked, maybe the correct command here is "open screen door". The system might expect the verb "open" followed by the object. So the next action should be "open screen door".

You've entered a backyard. You can barely contain your excitement.

You scan the room for a set of chairs, and you find a set of chairs! The set of chairs is typical. But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? What's that over there? It looks like it's a bbq. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a bbq, go to TextWorld. However, the bbq, like an empty bbq, has nothing on it. You can see a patio table. The patio table is normal. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

There is an open screen door leading west. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

Okay, the user is in the Garden now. The task was to pick up the bell pepper from the floor of the garden. The current location has a bell pepper on the floor. So the next action should be to pick up the bell pepper. The user has to use the command "take bell pepper" or "pick up bell pepper". Since the previous actions used "take" when picking up items, like the old key, it's likely the correct command here is "take bell pepper".

Okay, the user is in the Garden again. The task was to rest the bell pepper on the stove. But the current location is the Garden, and the previous step was picking up the bell pepper. Now, they need to go to the stove. However, the Garden description doesn't mention a stove. The Kitchen was earlier, but the user went back and forth between Garden, Backyard, Kitchen, etc.

Wait, the user has to rest the bell pepper on the stove. The stove is in the Kitchen, right? Because in the Kitchen description, there's a stove mentioned. So the user needs to go back to the Kitchen and put the bell pepper on the stove. But the current location is the Garden. So the next step is to go north to reach the Backyard, then maybe go east to the Kitchen? Or perhaps there's a direct path.

Looking at the current Garden description, the user can go north to the Backyard. Then, from the Backyard, they can go east to the Kitchen. But the user's last action was going south from the Backyard back to the Garden. So now, they need to go north again to the Backyard, then east to the Kitchen. But the user's next action should be to go north to the Backyard. Wait, but the user is in the Garden, and the Backyard is north. So the correct command is "go north" again. But the user has to go from Garden to Backyard, then from there to Kitchen. However, the user's current location is Garden, so the next step is to go north to Backyard. Then, from Backyard, go east to Kitchen. But the user's next action is to go north. But the user's last action was going south, so they need to go north again to get back to Backyard. Then, from Backyard, go east to Kitchen. But the user's next action should be "go north" to reach Backyard. Then, in Backyard, go east to Kitchen. But the user's current location is Garden, so the next command is "go north".

Okay, the user is in the Kitchen now. The task is to rest the bell pepper on the stove. The user has the bell pepper picked up. So the next step is to put it on the stove. The stove is in the kitchen, so the user needs to place the bell pepper there. The correct command would be "put bell pepper on stove" or "rest bell pepper on stove" as per the original goal. Since the game might expect specific verbs, "put" is more likely. So the next action is to put the bell pepper on the stove.
