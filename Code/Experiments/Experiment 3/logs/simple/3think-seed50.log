Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to open the chest drawer in the bedroom. After that, pick up the old key from the chest drawer within the bedroom. And then, look and see that the wooden door in the bedroom is unlocked. Then, open the wooden door inside the bedroom. After that, make an effort to move east. And then, go to the south. And then, recover the half of a bag of chips from the couch. Once you have got the half of a bag of chips, go north. With that over with, put the half of a bag of chips on the stove. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Bedroom =-
Well, here we are in the bedroom. Let's see what's in here.

You can see a closed chest drawer. You make out an antique trunk. You see a king-size bed. You shudder, but continue examining the king-size bed. The king-size bed is ordinary. The king-size bed appears to be empty.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me figure out what to do next. The user has already opened the chest drawer, picked up the old key, and looked at the wooden door. The next step according to the original instructions was to unlock the wooden door in the bedroom. But the user mentioned that the door is closed, so I need to try unlocking it with the key.

Wait, the user said "look and see that the wooden door in the bedroom is unlocked." But in the current state, the door is closed. Maybe I need to use the key to unlock it. So the next action should be to unlock the door. But how? The key is in hand, so maybe use it on the door.

Alternatively, maybe the door is locked, and the key is needed to open it. The user's previous action was looking at the door, and the response said the lid is in the way. Wait, the door is closed, so perhaps the next step is to try opening it. But the key is needed. So the correct action is to use the key on the door to unlock it. Then, after unlocking, open the door.

But the user's next step was to "open the wooden door inside the bedroom." So maybe after unlocking, the door can be opened. So the next action is to unlock the door with the key. Let me check the previous steps again.

The user has the key, so the next step is to unlock the door. The command would be "unlock wooden door" or "use key on wooden door". But in the game's context, maybe the correct command is "unlock door" or "open door". However, since the key is needed, the player must use it. So the correct action here is to unlock the door with the key. Therefore, the next command should be "unlock wooden door".

Okay, let's see. The player is in the bedroom, has opened the chest drawer, picked up the old key, tried to unlock the wooden door, and went east but was told to open the door first. They tried unlocking it again, but it's already unlocked. Now they need to proceed.

The next step after unlocking the door would be to open it. Since the door is already unlocked, maybe they just need to open it. But the previous attempt to go east failed because the door wasn't open. So maybe the player needs to open the door after unlocking it. But the game message said the door is unlocked, so perhaps they can go east now. Wait, the user tried to go east but the game said they need to open the door first. But the door is already unlocked. Maybe there's a confusion between unlocking and opening. So the correct action would be to open the door, even though it's already unlocked. Or maybe the door is locked but they have the key, so they need to open it. But the game message said it's unlocked. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the player should go east now since the door is unlocked. But the game said they have to open it first. Maybe the door is locked but they have the key, so they need to open it. But the game message said it's unlocked. This is a bit confusing. The player's next action should be to go east, but the game is preventing it. However, the door is already unlocked, so maybe the player can proceed. The correct action here is to go east, even though the game says to open the door first. But the door is already unlocked, so maybe the player can go east. Alternatively, maybe the door is locked, and the key is needed to open it. But the game message said it's unlocked. So perhaps the player should go east now.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in the game. They've opened the chest drawer, picked up the key, unlocked the door, but the door is still closed. Wait, the previous message said "That's unlocked at the moment." So maybe the door is unlocked but not open? Or maybe the key isn't working?

Wait, the user tried to go east but was told they need to open the wooden door first. Then they tried unlocking it again, but it's already unlocked. Hmm. Maybe the door is locked but they have the key. Wait, the initial description said the door is closed. So maybe the key is for the lock, but the door is just closed. So the user needs to open the door, not just unlock it. But the game says the door is unlocked. Maybe the user needs to push it open? Or maybe the key is for a different lock. Wait, the original goal was to open the wooden door in the bedroom. So if the door is unlocked, maybe they just need to open it. But the game is preventing them from moving east until the door is open. So perhaps the user needs to open the door, but the game isn't recognizing that the door is open even though it's unlocked. Maybe the user needs to use the key to open it, but the key is already used to unlock it. Maybe the door is locked and the key is needed to open it, but the user already unlocked it. This is confusing. The user is stuck in a loop of trying to unlock the door again when it's already unlocked. The next step should be to try opening the door, even though it's unlocked. Maybe the game requires them to open it despite being unlocked. So the correct action is to go east, even though the door is unlocked. But the game says they have to open it first. Maybe the door is locked but the key is already used to unlock it. So the user should try to go east again, even though the message says they need to open the door. Maybe the game has a bug, but the user needs to proceed. So the next action is to go east.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in the game, repeatedly trying to go east but being told they need to open the wooden door first. They've already unlocked the door, but maybe they're not opening it correctly. The key is in their inventory, so they should be able to use it. Wait, maybe the door is locked even though they unlocked it? Or perhaps the command isn't the right one. The previous attempts to "unlock wooden door" didn't work because the door is already unlocked. So the next step should be to go east despite the message. The game might be checking for the correct command regardless of the prompt. Let me check the previous steps. The user tried "go east" but the game said the door needs to be opened. But the door was already unlocked. Maybe the game has a bug, but the user needs to proceed. The correct action is to go east anyway.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in the game, repeatedly trying to go east but getting blocked because the wooden door isn't open. They've already unlocked the door, but maybe they're not realizing that it's already unlocked. The key here is that once the door is unlocked, they should be able to open it and proceed east. The game's feedback is confusing because it's saying they need to open the door first, but they already have the key and unlocked it. So the next logical step is to actually open the door with the key, which would allow them to go east. The user might be missing that the door is unlocked but still needs to be opened. So the correct action here is to open the door with the key they picked up earlier.

I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a stove, go to TextWorld. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove. Were you looking for a kitchen island? Because look over there, it's a kitchen island. The kitchen island is typical. On the kitchen island you see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps given in the initial instructions. They started in the bedroom, opened the chest drawer, picked up the old key, unlocked the wooden door, and then tried to go east. But there was a loop where they kept trying to go east but had to unlock the door first. Finally, they managed to open the door and moved to the kitchen. Then they went south to the living room.

In the living room, they found the half-bag of chips on the couch. The next step according to the original plan was to pick up the half of the bag of chips, then go north, put it on the stove, and win. So the next action should be to pick up the chips. The user is in the living room now, so the command should be "pick up half of a bag of chips" or something similar. But the exact phrasing might matter. Looking at the previous actions, the user was told to "recover the half of a bag of chips from the couch," so the correct command would be "pick up half of a bag of chips." Then after picking it up, they need to go north to the kitchen again, then put it on the stove. The user hasn't done that yet, so the next step is to pick up the chips.
