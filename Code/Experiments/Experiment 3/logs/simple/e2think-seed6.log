Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! First of all, ensure that the antique trunk is open. And then, recover the old key from the antique trunk. With the old key, unlock the wooden door. And then, ensure that the wooden door is open. Then, make an effort to go to the east. After that, ensure that the screen door inside the kitchen is open. After pulling open the screen door, take a trip east. Next, attempt to venture south. After that, pick up the apple from the floor of the garden. After that, travel north. With that accomplished, go west. And then, sit the apple on the stove within the kitchen. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Bedroom =-
You arrive in a bedroom. A typical one. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You can make out a closed chest drawer, which looks usual, in the corner. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see an antique trunk. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a king-size bed. The king-size bed is standard. But there isn't a thing on it.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps in the TextWorld game. They started by opening the antique trunk and taking the old key. Now, the next step according to the initial instructions was to use the old key to unlock the wooden door. The user has already done the first two steps, so the next logical action would be to unlock the door.

The current location is the bedroom, and there's a closed wooden door leading east. The user needs to use the old key to unlock it. So the correct command here is "unlock wooden door with old key". But in the game's context, maybe the command is just "unlock wooden door" since the key is already in the inventory. Wait, the previous actions were "open antique trunk" and "take old key from antique trunk", so the key is now in the player's inventory. Therefore, the next step is to unlock the door with that key. The game's commands might require specifying the key, but sometimes it's just the object. Let me check the previous interactions. The user was told to "unlock the wooden door" using the key. So the correct command here is "unlock wooden door". The system message says to only output the action, so the answer should be "unlock wooden door".

Okay, the user tried to go east but the wooden door is still closed. They need to open it first. The previous step was unlocking the door, but maybe the door isn't fully open yet. Wait, the game message said "You unlock wooden door." So maybe the door is now unlocked but not open. The user needs to open it. The correct action here is to open the wooden door. Let me check the previous interactions. The user had to ensure the door is open after unlocking. So the next step is "open wooden door".

Fancy seeing you here. Here, by the way, being the backyard. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You can make out a set of chairs. The set of chairs is standard. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a bbq. The bbq is normal. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a patio table. The patio table is usual. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is an open screen door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Backyard =-
Fancy seeing you here. Here, by the way, being the backyard. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You can make out a set of chairs. The set of chairs is standard. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a bbq. The bbq is normal. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a patio table. The patio table is usual. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is an open screen door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

Fancy seeing you here. Here, by the way, being the backyard. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You can make out a set of chairs. The set of chairs is standard. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a bbq. The bbq is normal. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a patio table. The patio table is usual. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is an open screen door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.
