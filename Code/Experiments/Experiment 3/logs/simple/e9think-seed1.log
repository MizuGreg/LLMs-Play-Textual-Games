Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, you could, like, look and see that the antique trunk inside the bedroom is opened. Then, recover the old key from the antique trunk. Then, make absolutely sure that the wooden door inside the bedroom is unlocked. After unlocking the wooden door, open the wooden door in the bedroom. Then, try to head east. After that, try to travel south. Once you get through with that, take the milk from the couch within the living room. Having taken the milk, attempt to travel north. That done, rest the milk on the stove inside the kitchen. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Bedroom =-
You make a grand eccentric entrance into a bedroom.

You see a closed normal looking chest drawer right there by you. You can see an antique trunk. You see a king-size bed. But the thing is empty.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is stuck on the wooden door. They've tried pushing and pulling it multiple times, but it's still fixed. The goal is to open the door to proceed east, then south, and eventually get the milk and rest it on the stove.

Wait, maybe the door is locked. The user previously unlocked the wooden door, but maybe that's not enough. Or perhaps there's another mechanism. Let me check the previous steps. The user opened the antique trunk and got the old key. Maybe the key is needed to unlock the door? But the user already tried unlocking it and failed.

Alternatively, maybe the door is jammed and needs a different approach. The key might be necessary to open it. The user has the key now. Maybe they need to use the key on the door. But the previous action was trying to push and pull. The key might be for a lock that's not mentioned yet. Wait, the problem says to make sure the wooden door is unlocked. Maybe the key is for a lock on the door. But the user hasn't tried using the key yet. So the next step should be to use the key on the door. Let me check the available actions. The user is in the bedroom, with the door east. The key is in their inventory. So the correct action would be to use the key on the door. But the game might require a specific command like "unlock wooden door with key" or "use key on door". Since the previous attempts were pushing and pulling, maybe the correct action is to use the key to unlock it. So the next command should be "unlock wooden door with old key" or similar. But the exact command depends on the game's syntax. Since the user has the key, they need to use it on the door. So the next action is to use the key to unlock the door.

Well how about that, you are in a place we're calling a kitchen. The room is well lit.

You make out a closed refrigerator nearby. You can see a counter. The counter is normal. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove. You see a kitchen island. On the kitchen island you can see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

Well I'll be, you are in the place we're calling the living room.

You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a couch. You see a milk on the couch. You see a low table. The low table is standard. On the low table you see a remote. You scan the room for a tv, and you find a tv. The tv is ordinary. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Okay, the user tried to "rest milk on stove" but the game didn't recognize it. So I need to figure out the correct command. Let me check the previous steps. The milk was taken from the couch in the living room, and now they're in the kitchen. The goal is to rest the milk on the stove in the kitchen.

Looking at the kitchen description, there's a stove mentioned. The user needs to place the milk on it. The correct verb might be "put" instead of "rest". So the command should be "put milk on stove". Let me confirm if that's the right action. Previous commands used "take" and "go", so "put" is likely the right verb here. The user has the milk in their inventory, so "put milk on stove" should work.
