Welcome to TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, you could, like, open the chest drawer. Then, pick up the old key from the chest drawer. After picking up the old key, assure that the wooden door is unlocked. Then, ensure that the wooden door is open. After pulling open the wooden door, take a trip east. And then, make sure that the screen door is wide open. After that, make an effort to move east. With that done, attempt to take a trip south. Then, pick-up the bell pepper from the floor of the garden. And then, attempt to go to the north. If you can succeed at that, make an effort to take a trip west. And then, rest the bell pepper on the stove. Got that? Good!

-= Bedroom =-
You are in a bedroom. A standard kind of place.

You can make out a chest drawer. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You see a closed antique trunk close by. Look over there! a king-size bed. The king-size bed appears to be empty.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. A standard one.

You see a refrigerator. You check the price tag that's still affixed to the refrigerator. 100 bucks? What a deal! You'll have to ask where they got this! You see a counter. The counter is typical. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. Look over there! a kitchen island. You wonder idly who left that here. The kitchen island is usual. On the kitchen island you see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

<think>
Okay, let me see. The user has been following the steps given in the original task. So far, they've opened the chest drawer, picked up the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, then went east to the kitchen. The current location is the kitchen, and the score is at 5/6.

The next step in the original task was to make sure the screen door is wide open. The user is in the kitchen, and the description mentions a closed screen door leading east. So the next action should be to open the screen door. 

Wait, the user's last action was "go east", which led them to the kitchen. Now, in the kitchen, the screen door is closed. The task says after opening the wooden door, they need to make sure the screen door is wide open. So the next step is to open the screen door. Then, after that, they need to attempt to move east again. But the screen door is east, so maybe after opening it, they can go east again. But the current prompt says the screen door is closed, so the user needs to open it first. 

So the correct next action is to open the screen door. Then, after that, they can go east. But according to the task, after making sure the screen door is open, they should attempt to move east again. But the user is in the kitchen now. Let me check the original steps again.

Original steps: After pulling open the wooden door, take a trip east. Then, make sure the screen door is wide open. Then, attempt to move east. So after opening the wooden door (which they did), they went east to the kitchen. Now, in the kitchen, they need to make sure the screen door is open. The screen door is closed here, so they need to open it. Then, after that, they can try moving east again. So the next action is to open the screen door.

-= Backyard =-
You've entered a backyard. You can barely contain your excitement.

You scan the room for a set of chairs, and you find a set of chairs! The set of chairs is typical. But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? What's that over there? It looks like it's a bbq. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a bbq, go to TextWorld. However, the bbq, like an empty bbq, has nothing on it. You can see a patio table. The patio table is normal. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

There is an open screen door leading west. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

I am so happy to announce that you are now in the garden. You begin to take stock of what's here.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked.

There is a half of a bag of chips, a bell pepper, an apple and a shovel on the floor.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Backyard again after going north from the Garden. The original goal was to pick up the bell pepper and rest it on the stove. But in the current Backyard, there's no stove mentioned. Wait, maybe the stove is in the Kitchen? The user had previously been in the Kitchen and then moved to the Backyard. The task said after picking up the bell pepper, they needed to attempt to go north, which they did, leading back to the Backyard. Now, the next step was to rest the bell pepper on the stove. But the current location is the Backyard, not the Kitchen. So maybe they need to go back to the Kitchen to put it on the stove.

But the user's last action was "go north", which brought them back to the Backyard. The score is at 9/11. The original steps mentioned after picking up the bell pepper, they should attempt to go north, which they did. Now, the next step is to rest the bell pepper on the stove. However, the stove is in the Kitchen. So the user needs to go back to the Kitchen from the Backyard. The Backyard has a screen door leading west, which might lead back to the Kitchen. So the next action should be to go west through the screen door to return to the Kitchen, then put the bell pepper on the stove. But the user is currently in the Backyard, so the next command should be "go west" to return to the Kitchen. Then, in the Kitchen, they can rest the bell pepper on the stove. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the correct next action is to go west to the Kitchen.
