It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First stop, open the chest drawer. And then, pick up the old key from the chest drawer within the bedroom. After picking up the old key, make it so that the wooden door is unlocked. After that, ensure that the wooden door within the bedroom is open. After that, move east. With that done, open the screen door. And then, go east. Following that, try to move south. Okay, and then, recover the apple from the floor of the garden. If you can get your hands on the apple, head north. That done, try to head west. And then, put the apple on the stove in the kitchen. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Bedroom =-
You find yourself in a bedroom. A typical kind of place. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You see a chest drawer. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can make out a closed antique trunk here. You see a king-size bed. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You swear loudly.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps in the TextWorld game. They started in the bedroom, opened the chest drawer, picked up the old key, unlocked the wooden door, and opened it. Now they're at the point where they need to move east.

The next step in the original instructions was to move east after opening the door. So the user should now "go east" to proceed. Since the previous actions have been successful and the score is increasing, it's likely that moving east is the correct next step. The user might be approaching the screen door mentioned earlier, which they need to open next. So the next action should be "go east".

GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Kitchen =-
You've just sauntered into a kitchen.

You make out a closed refrigerator. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. But there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the counter. You see a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a kitchen island! The kitchen island is normal. On the kitchen island you can see a note. Huh, weird.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

-= Backyard =-
You've entered a backyard.

You see a set of chairs. The set of chairs is ordinary. But there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You make out a bbq. However, the bbq, like an empty bbq, has nothing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a patio table! The patio table is usual. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

There is an open screen door leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

-= Garden =-
You arrive in a garden. An usual kind of place. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked.

There is a milk, an apple, a lettuce and a shovel on the floor.

Okay, let's see. The user has been progressing through the game steps. They opened the chest drawer, picked up the key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, moved east to the kitchen, opened the screen door, went east again to the backyard, and then went south to the garden. In the garden, they found a milk, an apple, lettuce, and a shovel on the floor.

The original goal was to recover the apple from the floor of the garden, put it on the stove in the kitchen, and then head north. So far, the user has reached the garden and found the apple. The next step is to pick up the apple. Once they have it, they need to go back to the kitchen and put it on the stove. Then, after that, they should head north to win.

Since the user is in the garden and the apple is on the floor, the immediate next action should be to pick up the apple. The command would be "pick up apple". That's the logical next step after finding it there.
</think>pick up apple
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

You pick up the apple from the ground.
