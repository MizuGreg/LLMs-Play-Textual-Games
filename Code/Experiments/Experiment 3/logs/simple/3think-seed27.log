Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. Your first objective is to look and see that the antique trunk is open. After that, pick up the old key from the antique trunk in the bedroom. After that, insert the old key into the wooden door inside the bedroom's lock to unlock it. And then, ensure that the wooden door in the bedroom is open. After that, travel east. Okay, and then, doublecheck that the refrigerator is ajar. Then, take the milk from the refrigerator. Then, place the milk on the stove inside the kitchen. That's it!

-= Bedroom =-
You arrive in a bedroom. A standard kind of place.

You can make out a closed chest drawer. You can see an antique trunk. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a king-size bed. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they need to follow a series of steps. So far, they've opened the antique trunk, taken the old key, and the score has increased. The next step according to the initial instructions was to insert the key into the wooden door in the bedroom to unlock it. The user hasn't done that yet.

Looking at the current environment, the bedroom has a closed wooden door leading east. The user has the key, so the next logical step is to use it on the door. The instruction says to insert the key into the lock to unlock the door. So the correct action here would be to try to unlock the door with the key. The user needs to go to the door, insert the key, and then unlock it. Once that's done, the door should open, and then they need to travel east as per the original plan. 

The user's previous actions were correct, and they're on track. The next step is to use the key on the door. The response should be a command like "unlock wooden door with old key" or something similar. But in the game's context, maybe the exact phrasing matters. The user has to interact with the door, so the correct command would be to try to unlock it. The user has the key, so the action is possible. Therefore, the next action is to unlock the door with the key.

Okay, let me figure out what to do next. The user is in the bedroom, tried to go east but the door is locked. They have the old key, which they used to unlock the door. The door is now unlocked, so maybe they can go east. The original goal was to open the trunk, get the key, unlock the door, make sure it's open, then go east, check the fridge, take milk, etc. So after unlocking the door, the next step is to go east. But the system message says "You have to open the wooden door first," but they just unlocked it. Maybe the door is unlocked but not open yet. So perhaps they need to open it again? Or maybe the command "go east" is blocked until the door is open. Wait, the user tried to go east and the system said the door has to be opened. But they just unlocked it. Maybe the door is unlocked but still closed, so they need to open it. But how? The key was used to unlock the lock, but opening the door might require another action. Or maybe "unlock" and "open" are different steps. The user has the key, so maybe they need to use it again to open the door. But the system said "That's unlocked at the moment," so maybe the door is unlocked but not open. So the next step is to open the door. But how? Maybe the command is "open wooden door" again. Alternatively, maybe "go east" is possible now. Wait, the user tried to go east and the system said the door has to be opened. But the door was just unlocked. Maybe the door is unlocked but still closed, so they need to open it. But the key was used to unlock the lock, not to open the door. Maybe the door is locked but now unlocked, so it's open. Maybe the system is confused. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "open the wooden door" again. But the user already unlocked it. Hmm. The original goal was to ensure the door is open. So perhaps after unlocking, the door is open. Maybe the system is just checking that. So the next step is to go east. But the user tried to go east and the system said the door has to be opened. But the door is unlocked. Maybe the user needs to open the door again. But how? Maybe the correct command is "open wooden door" again. But the user already unlocked it. Alternatively, maybe the door is unlocked but not open, so they need to open it. So the next action is "open wooden door". But the system said "That's unlocked at the moment," so maybe the door is unlocked but still closed. So the user needs to open it. But the key was used to unlock the lock, not to open the door. Maybe the door is now open. Maybe the system is just checking. So the next step is to go east. But the user tried to go east and the system said the door has to be opened. So perhaps the door is not open yet. Maybe the user needs to open the door. But how? Maybe the correct command is "open wooden door". Let me check the previous steps. The user unlocked the door with the key, and the system said "You unlock wooden door." Then the next step was to go east, but the system said "You have to open the wooden door first." So maybe the door is unlocked but not open. So the user needs to open it. But how? Maybe the command is "open wooden door". So the next action is "open wooden door".

You've entered a kitchen.

You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a refrigerator. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can make out a counter. The counter is normal. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You see a stove. The stove is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You can see a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the kitchen now. The original goal was to check the refrigerator, take the milk, and put it on the stove. The user just entered the kitchen, and the refrigerator is mentioned as being in the corner. The user's next step should be to look at the refrigerator to check if it's ajar. But wait, the user previously tried to look at the refrigerator in the bedroom and couldn't. Now in the kitchen, they should check the refrigerator here.

The current location is the kitchen, and the user needs to check the refrigerator. The prompt says "doublecheck that the refrigerator is ajar." So the next action should be to look at the refrigerator. Then, if it's open, take the milk. But the user's last action was going east, which led them to the kitchen. So the next command should be "look at refrigerator" to confirm it's open. Then proceed to take the milk if it's there.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps given in the original goal. They started by opening the antique trunk in the bedroom, taking the key, unlocking the door, and then going east to the kitchen. Now they've opened the refrigerator, taken the milk, and the next step was to place the milk on the stove.

Wait, the current location is the kitchen. The user just took the milk from the refrigerator. The next action should be to go to the stove. But how? The user needs to move to the stove's location. In the kitchen description, there's a stove mentioned. So the correct step is to go to the stove. Then, place the milk there. But the user's last action was taking the milk, so the next command should be 'go to stove' or 'go to stove area'. However, in the game's context, the possible commands are more straightforward. The user is in the kitchen, and the stove is present. So the next action is to go to the stove. Then, after being there, place the milk on it. But the user has to first move to the stove's location. So the next command should be 'go to stove' or similar. But looking at the previous commands, the user used 'go east' to move between rooms. In the kitchen, the stove is part of the environment. So the correct next step is to go to the stove. Therefore, the answer is 'go to stove' or 'go to stove area'. But the game might expect a specific command. Since the user is in the kitchen, and the stove is there, the command would be 'go to stove' or 'go to stove'. However, in the previous steps, the user used 'go east' to move between rooms. So maybe the correct command here is 'go to stove' or 'go to stove area'. But the exact command might be 'go to stove' or 'go to stove'. Alternatively, since the stove is in the kitchen, maybe the user is already there, so the next step is to place the milk. But the user has to first be at the stove's location. So the correct next action is to go to the stove. Therefore, the answer is 'go to stove'.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the steps given in the game. They've already opened the antique trunk, taken the key, unlocked the door, and gone east to the kitchen. They opened the refrigerator, took the milk, and now they need to place the milk on the stove.

The current issue is that the user is trying to "go to stove" but the game says they can't see it. Wait, in the kitchen description, there's a stove mentioned. The user might be confused about the commands. The correct action here is to "put milk on stove" instead of moving to it. Since the stove is already in the room, the command should be to place the milk there. The user probably tried moving to the stove, but the actual action needed is putting the milk on it. So the next step is to use the "put" command.
