I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, open the antique trunk. And then, retrieve the old key from the antique trunk. With the old key, unlock the wooden door inside the bedroom with the old key. Then, ensure that the wooden door is open. And then, head east. After that, ensure that the screen door is open. And then, head east. And then, try to move south. And then, pick-up the bell pepper from the floor of the garden. With the bell pepper, attempt to head north. With that accomplished, go to the west. And then, place the bell pepper on the stove. Alright, thanks!

-= Bedroom =-
Ah, the bedroom. This is some kind of bedroom, really great normal vibes in this place, a wonderful normal atmosphere. You can barely contain your excitement.

You can make out a closed chest drawer in the room. You can see a closed antique trunk nearby. You make out a king-size bed. The king-size bed is normal. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing a text adventure game called TextWorld. Their task is to follow a series of steps to complete a quest. So far, they've opened an antique trunk and retrieved an old key. But the system gave an error saying "That's not a verb I recognise." Wait, maybe the user tried to "retrieve" the key, but the correct command is "take" or "get"?

Looking back at the previous interaction: the user said "retrieve the old key from the antique trunk", and the system responded with an error. So the system doesn't recognize "retrieve" as a valid verb. In text adventures, common verbs are "take", "get", "open", "use", etc. So the correct action here would be "take the old key" or "get the old key".

The user's next step after retrieving the key is to unlock the wooden door in the bedroom with the old key. So after getting the key, they need to use it on the door. The next steps in the original task are: unlock the wooden door, ensure it's open, head east, open the screen door, head east again, move south, pick up the bell pepper, use it to head north, go west, and place the bell pepper on the stove.

But first, the user needs to correctly take the key. Since "retrieve" isn't a valid command, the correct action is "take" or "get". Let me check the game's possible commands. In many text adventures, "take" is the standard verb for picking up items. So the user should use "take the old key" next.

After that, they can use the key to unlock the door. The door is described as closed and leading east. So the next steps would be to use the key on the door, then open it. Then move east, etc.

So the correct next action is to take the key. The user's previous attempt was to "retrieve", which the system didn't recognize. So the answer should be "take the old key".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to use the old key on the wooden door. The previous attempt was "use the old key on the wooden door", but the system said that's not a recognized verb. Hmm. In text adventures, the correct verb for interacting with an object might be "unlock" instead of "use". So maybe the right command is "unlock the wooden door with the old key" or something similar.

Wait, the user has the key, so they need to use it to unlock the door. The system might expect the command "unlock" as the verb. Let me check the possible commands again. Common verbs for interacting with objects include "open", "use", "unlock", "push", "pull", etc. Since the door is closed and the key is a tool to open it, "unlock" is likely the correct verb here.

So the next action should be "unlock the wooden door" or "unlock the door with the old key". But the system might require the exact phrasing. The user previously tried "use", which didn't work. Maybe the correct command is "unlock the wooden door". Let me try that.

Okay, let's see. The user tried to go east but the game said they have to open the wooden door first. So the previous step was unlocking the door, which they did. Now, the door is unlocked but maybe not open yet. The command "unlock" might have just made it unlocked, but to open it, they need to use "open" instead. So the next action should be "open the wooden door" to ensure it's open before moving east. Then they can proceed as instructed.

Okay, the user tried to type "go east" but the system said that's not a recognized verb. Hmm. In text adventures, the correct command might be "move east" or "walk east" instead of "go east". Let me check the possible commands again. The user is in the bedroom, and after opening the door, they need to move east. The correct verb here is probably "move" or "walk". So the next action should be "move east" or "walk east". Since the system didn't recognize "go", using "move" might work.

Wait, the user's previous action was opening the door, and the next step is to move east. The correct command is likely "move east". Let me try that.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the steps in the game. They've opened the antique trunk, taken the key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, then tried to move east. But now they're told they must name something more substantial. The next step in the original task was to ensure the screen door is open after moving east. But the user tried "open the screen door" and got a response that it isn't there.

Wait, maybe the screen door is in a different room. After moving east from the bedroom, they might be in a new room where the screen door is located. But the user hasn't moved east yet. The previous attempt to "move east" was rejected, so maybe the correct command is "go east" instead of "move". But the system said "go" wasn't a verb. Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "walk east".

Alternatively, perhaps the screen door is in the same room, but the user hasn't looked properly. Maybe they need to check the room again. But the task says after moving east, ensure the screen door is open. So maybe the user needs to first move east, then open the screen door. But the system is rejecting "move east" as a command. Maybe the correct verb is "go east" even though the system said "go" isn't a verb. Or maybe the system expects "enter" or "pass" instead.

Alternatively, maybe the user is in a room where the screen door is already present, but the command to open it is different. But the user tried "open the screen door" and got a negative response. So perhaps the screen door isn't there, and the user needs to find another way. Maybe the next step is to pick up the bell pepper from the garden, but that requires moving to the garden. However, the user's current location is the bedroom after moving east. Wait, the original task says after ensuring the wooden door is open, head east, then ensure the screen door is open, then head east again. So maybe after opening the wooden door, the user is in a room where the screen door is located. But the system says "can't see any such thing" when trying to open the screen door. Maybe the screen door is in a different room, and the user needs to move east again. But the previous attempt to move east was rejected. Maybe the correct command is "go east" even though the system said "go" isn't a verb. Alternatively, the system might accept "move east" as the correct command. Let me try that.

Okay, let's try to figure out what's going on here. The user is in the bedroom, has the old key, opened the wooden door, and tried to move east. The system is giving errors for commands like "go east" and "open the screen door". The task says after opening the wooden door, they need to ensure the screen door is open, then head east again.

Wait, maybe the screen door is in the same room as the wooden door. But when the user tried to open it, the system said they can't see it. Maybe the screen door is in a different room, and the user needs to move east again. But the previous attempt to move east was rejected. The system might be expecting a different command, like "enter" or "pass" the door. Alternatively, maybe the screen door is part of the wooden door, and the user needs to open it again. But the user already opened the wooden door. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to pick up the bell pepper from the garden, but that requires moving to the garden. However, the task says after moving east twice, then try to move south. So perhaps the user needs to move east again, even if the system is rejecting the command. Maybe the correct command is "go east" despite the system's previous rejection. Let me try that.

-= Living Room =-
You arrive in a living room. A normal kind of place.

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a couch. The couch is normal. On the couch you see a lettuce. You see a low table. On the low table you make out a remote. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Look over there! a tv. The tv is typical. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset.

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. It seems to be pretty usual here.

Were you looking for a refrigerator? Because look over there, it's a refrigerator. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. The counter appears to be empty. You scan the room, seeing a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is typical. On the kitchen island you make out a note. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

Okay, the user has been moving around the house, picking up items, and following the steps. The original goal was to pick up the bell pepper, use it to head north, then go west and place it on the stove. But in the current state, they're back in the kitchen. The bell pepper was picked up in the garden, then they went north to the backyard, then west to the kitchen. Now, the next step is to place the bell pepper on the stove. The stove is in the kitchen, so the user needs to go to the stove and put the bell pepper there. The correct command would be "put bell pepper on stove" or "place bell pepper on stove". Let me check if "put" is a valid verb here. In text adventures, "put" is commonly used for placing items. So the next action should be "put bell pepper on stove".
