Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First, it would be great if you could make sure that the antique trunk is opened. After that, pick up the old key from the antique trunk inside the bedroom. After picking up the old key, assure that the wooden door in the bedroom is unlocked. After unlocking the wooden door, doublecheck that the wooden door is wide open. Then, try to go to the east. With that accomplished, ensure that the refrigerator within the kitchen is open. And then, retrieve the milk from the refrigerator inside the kitchen. And then, rest the milk on the stove. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Bedroom =-
You are in a bedroom. A normal kind of place.

What's that over there? It looks like it's a chest drawer. You can see a closed antique trunk. You scan the room for a king-size bed, and you find a king-size bed. The king-size bed is standard. But the thing is empty.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game, and they've already done a few steps. The goal is to open the antique trunk, get the key, unlock the door, open the door, go east, open the fridge, get milk, put it on the stove, and win.

So far, they've opened the trunk, picked up the key, unlocked the door. The next step according to the original instructions was to double-check that the door is wide open. But the user's last action was unlocking the door, and the system message says they're at 3/4. Wait, the original plan was after unlocking, double-check the door is open. Then go east. Then proceed to the kitchen.

But the user's last action was "unlock wooden door", which succeeded. Now, the next logical step would be to check if the door is open. The user might need to verify that the door is indeed wide open. So the next action should be to open the door, but maybe the system already does that. Wait, the user has to make sure the door is open. So maybe the next command is "open wooden door" or "push wooden door" to make sure it's fully open. Alternatively, maybe the game requires the player to check the state of the door. But in the game's context, after unlocking, the door might be locked, so they need to open it. But the user has already unlocked it. So perhaps the next step is to open the door. But the user's next action should be to check if the door is open. However, the user's next step in the original plan was to "doublecheck that the wooden door is wide open." So the correct action here is to open the door. But how? Maybe the command is "open wooden door". Let me check the previous steps. The user was in the bedroom, and the wooden door leads east. After unlocking, they need to open it. So the next action should be "open wooden door". But the user might have to push it. Alternatively, the game might have a "push" command. But according to the previous steps, the user has to make sure the door is open. So the next action is to open the door. Therefore, the correct command is "open wooden door".

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. A typical kind of place.

What's that over there? It looks like it's a refrigerator. You see a counter. The counter is typical. But the thing is empty. Sometimes, just sometimes, TextWorld can just be the worst. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You see a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island. Now that's what I call TextWorld!

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an unguarded exit to the north. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

Okay, let's see. The user has to retrieve milk from the refrigerator and then put it on the stove. So far, they've opened the refrigerator and found both milk and lettuce. The next step is to pick up the milk. Once they have the milk, they need to go to the stove, which is mentioned in the kitchen description. The user is in the kitchen now, so they should take the milk first. Then, they need to rest the milk on the stove. The stove is in the kitchen, so after taking the milk, they can go to the stove and put it there. Let me check the previous steps again to make sure I don't miss anything. The user has already opened the refrigerator, so the next logical step is to take the milk. Then, go to the stove. The command should be "take milk" followed by "go to stove" or something similar. But the exact commands might depend on the game's syntax. Since the user is in the kitchen, they can take the milk from the refrigerator. Then, they need to rest it on the stove. So the next action is to take the milk.
