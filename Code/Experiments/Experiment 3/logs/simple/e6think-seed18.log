Welcome to TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, you could, like, open the chest drawer. Then, pick up the old key from the chest drawer. After picking up the old key, assure that the wooden door is unlocked. Then, ensure that the wooden door is open. After pulling open the wooden door, take a trip east. And then, make sure that the screen door is wide open. After that, make an effort to move east. With that done, attempt to take a trip south. Then, pick-up the bell pepper from the floor of the garden. And then, attempt to go to the north. If you can succeed at that, make an effort to take a trip west. And then, rest the bell pepper on the stove. Got that? Good!

-= Bedroom =-
You are in a bedroom. A standard kind of place.

You can make out a chest drawer. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You see a closed antique trunk close by. Look over there! a king-size bed. The king-size bed appears to be empty.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

The kitchen island is usual. On the kitchen island you see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game and has followed a series of steps to progress. They've opened the chest drawer, picked up the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, then went east into the kitchen. They opened the screen door, and now they're at the kitchen. The next step in the original task was to make sure the screen door is wide open, which they did. Then they needed to attempt to move east again. But in the current location (Kitchen), the screen door is east, and the wooden door west. The user's next action would be to go east again, but the screen door is already open. Wait, the task said after opening the screen door, they should attempt to move east. So maybe they need to go east from the kitchen. But the kitchen's east door is the screen door, which is open. So the next command would be "go east" again. But the user already did that? Wait, let me check the steps again.

Original task steps: After opening the screen door, attempt to move east. Then, after that, attempt to take a trip south. So after opening the screen door (which they did), they need to go east again. But in the kitchen, going east leads to the screen door. Wait, maybe the screen door is part of the kitchen's east exit. So after opening it, they can go east. But the user is in the kitchen, and the screen door is east. So "go east" would be the next step. Then, after that, they need to go south. But the user's current location is the kitchen. So the next action is "go east" again. But the user just opened the screen door, so they can go east. So the next command is "go east".

-= Backyard =-
You've entered a backyard. You can barely contain your excitement.

You scan the room for a set of chairs, and you find a set of chairs! The set of chairs is typical. But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? What's that over there? It looks like it's a bbq. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a bbq, go to TextWorld. However, the bbq, like an empty bbq, has nothing on it. You can see a patio table. The patio table is normal. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

There is an open screen door leading west. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to rest the bell pepper on the stove. But the game says that's not a recognized verb. So they need to find another way to accomplish that task.

Looking back at the original goals, after picking up the bell pepper, they needed to rest it on the stove. But in the current location (Garden), there's a stove mentioned? Wait, in the Kitchen scene, there's a stove, but now they're in the Garden. Wait, maybe the stove is in the Kitchen, and they need to go back to the Kitchen to put it there. But the user is in the Garden now. Let me check the previous steps.

The user was in the Garden, picked up the bell pepper. Then they tried to rest it on the stove. But the Garden doesn't have a stove. The stove is in the Kitchen. So maybe they need to go back to the Kitchen. But how? The Garden has a north exit to Backyard, which has a screen door west leading back to the Kitchen. So the steps would be: go north to Backyard, then west to Kitchen, then rest the bell pepper on the stove.

But the user is in the Garden, and the current possible moves are north or south. The user tried to rest the bell pepper on the stove, which isn't possible here. So the correct action is to go north to Backyard, then west to Kitchen, then rest the bell pepper on the stove. But the user needs to do that step by step. The next command should be to go north to Backyard.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, the user is trying to rest the bell pepper on the stove, but the game doesn't recognize that command. Let me think about the possible steps here.

First, the user has the bell pepper in their inventory, as they picked it up in the garden. The stove is in the kitchen. So the user needs to be in the kitchen to place the bell pepper on the stove. They were in the kitchen earlier, but maybe they need to interact with the stove or a specific object to place the item there.

In TextWorld, sometimes you have to use verbs like "put" instead of "rest." Maybe the correct command is "put the bell pepper on the stove." But the user tried "rest," which isn't a valid verb here. So the next step is to try using the correct verb, "put."

Alternatively, maybe the stove is part of the kitchen island or the counter. The user might need to go to the stove's location. But since they're already in the kitchen, perhaps they just need to use the correct command. Let me check the previous steps again.

The user was in the garden, picked up the bell pepper, then went back to the kitchen. Now, in the kitchen, they need to place the bell pepper on the stove. The correct command is likely "put the bell pepper on the stove." Since the game didn't recognize "rest," the user should try "put" instead.
