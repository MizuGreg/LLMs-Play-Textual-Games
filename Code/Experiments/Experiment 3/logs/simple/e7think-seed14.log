It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First step, doublecheck that the antique trunk in the bedroom is wide open. After that, pick up the old key from the antique trunk. After that, make it so that the wooden door inside the bedroom is unlocked with the old key. And then, ensure that the wooden door is open. Then, move east. Then, try to head south. Then, pick up the milk from the couch. Then, make an effort to travel north. Then, put the milk on the stove. That's it!

-= Bedroom =-
I never took you for the sort of person who would show up in a bedroom, but I guess I was wrong.

You can make out a closed chest drawer. You can make out a closed antique trunk. Hey, want to see a king-size bed? Look over there, a king-size bed. The king-size bed is usual. The king-size bed appears to be empty. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen.

You see a refrigerator. You make out a counter. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You can see a stove. The stove is ordinary. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. This always happens! Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an unguarded exit to the north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Living Room =-
You find yourself in a living room. A normal one.

Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a couch. On the couch you can make out a milk. You make out a low table. On the low table you make out a remote. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You see a tv. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps in the TextWorld game. They started in the bedroom, opened the antique trunk, took the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, then went east to the kitchen. From there, they went south to the living room. Now, the next steps according to the original task were: pick up the milk from the couch, then travel north, then put the milk on the stove.

In the living room, the user sees a couch with a milk on it. So the next logical step is to pick up the milk. The user's last action was going south to the living room, so the next command should be "take milk from couch" or something similar. But the exact phrasing might depend on the game's command syntax. Since the user has been using commands like "take old key", "unlock wooden door", etc., it's likely that the correct command here is "take milk from couch".

After picking up the milk, the next step is to travel north. So once the milk is taken, the user should "go north". Then, they need to put the milk on the stove. In the kitchen, there's a stove, so after going north back to the kitchen, they would "put milk on stove".

But the user's current location is the living room. The next immediate action is to pick up the milk. So the correct command here is "take milk from couch". The user's previous action was "go south", so the next step is to take the milk. Then, after that, they need to go north to the kitchen and put the milk on the stove. But the user's next move should be the immediate next step, which is taking the milk.
