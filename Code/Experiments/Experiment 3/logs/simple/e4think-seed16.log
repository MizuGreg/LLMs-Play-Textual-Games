I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, open the antique trunk. And then, retrieve the old key from the antique trunk. With the old key, unlock the wooden door inside the bedroom with the old key. Then, ensure that the wooden door is open. And then, head east. After that, ensure that the screen door is open. And then, head east. And then, try to move south. And then, pick-up the bell pepper from the floor of the garden. With the bell pepper, attempt to head north. With that accomplished, go to the west. And then, place the bell pepper on the stove. Alright, thanks!

-= Bedroom =-
Ah, the bedroom. This is some kind of bedroom, really great normal vibes in this place, a wonderful normal atmosphere. You can barely contain your excitement.

You can make out a closed chest drawer in the room. You can see a closed antique trunk nearby. You make out a king-size bed. The king-size bed is normal. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me see. The user is playing a text-based game and has followed a series of steps. So far, they've opened an antique trunk, retrieved an old key, unlocked a wooden door, and the score has increased each time. The current task is to ensure the wooden door is open, then head east, open a screen door, head east again, move south, pick up a bell pepper, use it to head north, go west, and place the bell pepper on the stove.

The user is now asking if they're on the right track and if they're close to the goal. The assistant needs to confirm that the actions so far are correct and then proceed with the next step. The next action after unlocking the door is to ensure the door is open, which they've already done. Then they need to head east. The user's last action was unlocking the door, so the next step should be moving east. The assistant should respond with "go east" as the next command.

Okay, the user is stuck because they keep trying to go east but the game says they need to open the wooden door first. Let me check the previous steps. The user unlocked the door earlier, but maybe it's not fully open yet. The game might require them to open it again. Alternatively, maybe the door was locked again after unlocking. The user's score is at 3/8, so they need to proceed correctly.

The original task was to unlock the wooden door in the bedroom, ensure it's open, then head east. The user did unlock it, but perhaps the game considers it not open. So the next step should be opening the door again. The correct command would be "open the wooden door" again. But the user tried "go east" multiple times and got errors. So the assistant needs to remind them to open the door first. The next action should be opening the door again, then proceeding east. But the user might need to use the correct verb. The game might require "open" instead of "unlock" again. Let me check the previous interactions. The user used "unlock the wooden door with the old key" which worked. Now, maybe the door is locked again, so they need to unlock it again. But the task was to unlock it once. Hmm, maybe the game's logic is that after unlocking, they need to open it again. Alternatively, maybe the door is closed again. The user's last action was going east, which is invalid until the door is open. So the correct next step is to open the door again. The assistant should respond with "open the wooden door".

You are in a kitchen. It seems to be pretty usual here.

Were you looking for a refrigerator? Because look over there, it's a refrigerator. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. The counter appears to be empty. You scan the room, seeing a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is typical. On the kitchen island you make out a note. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps correctly so far. They opened the antique trunk, got the key, unlocked the door, and then went through some doors. Now they're in the kitchen, opened the screen door, and the score is up. The next step according to the original task was to head east after opening the screen door. The user just opened the screen door, so the next action should be going east again. The game might have a typo or confusion in the messages, but the correct command is "go east".

The main issue is that they can't find the right path to get to the stove. The original goal was to place the bell pepper on the stove, but they've been stuck in the kitchen and bathroom.

Looking at the current state, the user is back in the kitchen. The kitchen has an open screen door east and a wooden door west. The user needs to go west to the backyard again. But earlier, when they tried going west from the kitchen, they ended up in the bathroom. Wait, maybe the path is different. Let me check the previous steps.

Earlier, after going south from the backyard, they ended up in the bathroom, then went back to the kitchen. Now, they need to find a way back to the garden. The correct path should be from the kitchen, go west through the wooden door to the backyard, then south to the garden. But the user tried that before and got stuck. Maybe the problem is that the screen door is open east, but they need to go west. Alternatively, maybe the user is missing a step where they need to go north from the kitchen to get back to the garden.

Wait, the kitchen has an unguarded exit north. If they go north from the kitchen, they might reach the garden. But earlier, going north from the kitchen led them to the bathroom. Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe the game's layout is different. The user needs to find the correct path to the garden. Since the garden is where the stove is, and the user has the bell pepper, they need to get to the garden again.

The user's last action was looking around the kitchen. The next step should be to go west through the wooden door to the backyard. Even though earlier it led to the bathroom, maybe there's another way. Alternatively, maybe they need to go east through the screen door and then south. But the screen door leads east, which is the backyard. Wait, the backyard has a south exit to the garden. So from the kitchen, go east to the backyard, then south to the garden. But the user tried that before and got stuck. Maybe the screen door is closed again. But in the current state, the screen door is open. So the correct path is kitchen -> east (screen door) -> south to garden. But the user was previously stuck there. Maybe they need to try that again. So the next command should be "go east" from the kitchen to the backyard, then "go south" to the garden. But the user is in the kitchen now, so the next step is "go east".

-= Backyard =-
You've just shown up in a backyard.

You can see a set of chairs. However, the set of chairs, like an empty set of chairs, has nothing on it. You move on, clearly done caring about TextWorld. You can make out a bbq. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can see a patio table. The patio table is typical. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is an open screen door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

You are in a kitchen. It seems to be pretty usual here.

Were you looking for a refrigerator? Because look over there, it's a refrigerator. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. The counter appears to be empty. You scan the room, seeing a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is typical. On the kitchen island you make out a note. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

You arrive in a living room. A normal kind of place.

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a couch. The couch is normal. On the couch you see a lettuce. You see a low table. On the low table you make out a remote. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Look over there! a tv. The tv is typical. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset.

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. It seems to be pretty usual here.

Were you looking for a refrigerator? Because look over there, it's a refrigerator. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. The counter appears to be empty. You scan the room, seeing a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is typical. On the kitchen island you make out a note. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

-= Living Room =-
You arrive in a living room. A normal kind of place.

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a couch. The couch is normal. On the couch you see a lettuce. You see a low table. On the low table you make out a remote. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Look over there! a tv. The tv is typical. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset.

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.
