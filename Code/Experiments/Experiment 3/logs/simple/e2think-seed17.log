Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, you could, like, ensure that the chest drawer is open. And then, take the old key from the chest drawer inside the bedroom. With the old key, doublecheck that the wooden door is unlocked. And then, open the wooden door within the bedroom. Then, attempt to go east. Then, make absolutely sure that the screen door inside the kitchen is opened. And then, attempt to venture east. Next, travel south. And then, lift the half of a bag of chips from the floor of the garden. Then, make an effort to move north. If you can finish that, venture west. And then, rest the half of a bag of chips on the stove. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Bedroom =-
You've just sauntered into a bedroom. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

You can see a chest drawer. You can see an antique trunk. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You see a king-size bed. The king-size bed is usual. The king-size bed appears to be empty.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a text adventure game. They've already opened the chest drawer and taken the old key. The next step according to the original task was to double-check that the wooden door is unlocked using the old key. So, I need to make sure they unlock the door.

Wait, the current location is the bedroom. The wooden door leading east is closed. The user has the old key, so they should use it to unlock the door. The next action should be to unlock the wooden door. But how is the command structured here? In TextWorld, the command would be something like "unlock wooden door" or "use old key on wooden door". But the user has the key, so maybe "unlock wooden door" is the right command here. Let me check the previous actions. The user was told to "doublecheck that the wooden door is unlocked" using the key. So the correct action is to unlock it. The next step after taking the key is to unlock the door. So the next command should be "unlock wooden door".

Okay, the user tried to go east but couldn't because the wooden door was still closed. They already unlocked it using the old key, so the door should be open now. Wait, maybe the game doesn't automatically open the door after unlocking. Let me check the previous messages. The user unlocked the door, but the game might require them to open it explicitly. Or maybe the door was just unlocked but not open yet. The task said to "open the wooden door within the bedroom" after double-checking it's unlocked. So maybe the next step is to open the door again. But the user already unlocked it. Hmm, perhaps the correct command is "open wooden door" even though they have the key. Alternatively, maybe the door is now unlocked and can be opened. The user's last action was unlocking, but the game says they can't go east yet. So the next step is to open the door. Wait, the user has the key, so maybe they need to use it to open the door. But they already unlocked it. Maybe the game requires them to open it again. So the next command should be "open wooden door".

Okay, the user has successfully opened the wooden door and moved east. The next part of the task was to make sure the screen door in the kitchen is opened and then venture east again. But first, they need to check the kitchen's screen door. However, the current location is probably the east room of the bedroom, which might be connected to the kitchen. Wait, the original task said after going east from the bedroom, then make sure the screen door in the kitchen is open. So the user is now in the east room (maybe the kitchen?), but the screen door might be closed. The next step is to open the screen door in the kitchen. But how to confirm where they are? The previous steps were in the bedroom, then went east through the door. Now, the next action should be to check the kitchen's screen door. The command would be "open screen door" or "open kitchen screen door". The user needs to make sure that door is open before proceeding east again. So the next command is to open the screen door in the kitchen.

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. An usual kind of place.

You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a refrigerator. Hmmm... what else, what else? You smell an intriguing smell, and follow it to a counter. The counter is standard. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You see a stove. The stove is ordinary. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is ordinary. On the kitchen island you see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

Okay, the user tried to go east from the kitchen but the screen door is closed. The task was to make sure the screen door is opened before venturing east. So the next step is to open the screen door. The command should be "open screen door" or "open screen door in kitchen". Since the user is in the kitchen and the screen door is closed, the correct action is to open it.

Wait, the previous action was "go east", but the screen door is closed. The game's response says the screen door is closed leading east. So the user needs to open it first. Therefore, the next command should be "open screen door" to proceed east. The user's next action should be to open the screen door in the kitchen.

Okay, the user is stuck in the kitchen trying to open the screen door. They've tried "open screen door in kitchen" multiple times, and the game keeps saying "What a good idea." But the door isn't opening. Maybe the correct command is just "open screen door" without specifying the kitchen. Or perhaps the door is already open, but the game's description is outdated. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to interact with the door differently. Since the task requires opening the screen door before going east, and the user has already done that, maybe they should proceed east again. But the game is blocking it. Wait, the original task said after opening the screen door, attempt to venture east. So maybe the next step is "go east" again.
