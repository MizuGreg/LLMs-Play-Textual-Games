Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, doublecheck that the antique trunk in the bedroom is open. Then, pick up the old key from the antique trunk. Then, make it so that the wooden door within the bedroom is unlocked. Then, open the wooden door. After opening the wooden door, venture east. Then, open the screen door. Then, make an attempt to head east. That done, take a trip south. Then, pick up the milk from the floor of the garden. After getting the milk, try to head north. That done, attempt to take a trip west. Then, sit the milk on the stove in the kitchen. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Bedroom =-
You find yourself in a bedroom. An usual one. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You can see a chest drawer. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's an antique trunk. Were you looking for a king-size bed? Because look over there, it's a king-size bed. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps given. They started by opening the antique trunk, picking up the key, unlocking the wooden door, and then opening it. Now they're at the point where they need to go east through the door.

The next step in the original instructions was to venture east after opening the wooden door. So the user should now move east. But wait, the current location is the bedroom, and the wooden door was leading east. After opening it, they should go through that door. The next command would be "go east" or "open wooden door" again, but since the door is already open, it's probably "go east".

But looking at the previous steps, after unlocking the door, the user was told to "open the wooden door". The system message says that after unlocking, the door is now open. So the next action is to go east. Then, after that, they need to open the screen door, but that's part of the next steps. So the immediate next action is to go east through the opened door. The user's next command should be "go east".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in the TextWorld game. They started by opening the antique trunk in the bedroom, picking up the key, and unlocking the wooden door. But when they tried to go east, the game said they had to open the door first. Wait, the door was already unlocked, right? So maybe the problem is that the door is locked but they have the key. Wait, no, the user just unlocked it with the key. Hmm.

Wait, the user tried to go east after unlocking the door, but the game said they had to open the door first. That doesn't make sense because the door was already unlocked. Maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Let me check the previous steps again. The user had the old key, unlocked the wooden door, and then tried to go east. The game responded that they needed to open the door first. That's confusing because the door was already unlocked. Maybe the game is considering the door as closed even though it's unlocked? Or perhaps there's a mistake in the game's logic.

But the user is following the instructions step by step. The original goal was to open the wooden door after unlocking it. So maybe the user needs to open the door again? But why would they need to open it again if it's already unlocked? Alternatively, maybe the door is locked again after being unlocked. But that's not logical. Wait, maybe the user didn't actually open the door. The command "unlock wooden door" might have just made it unlocked, but the door is still closed. So the user needs to open it, not just unlock it. Oh, that's probably it! The door was locked, so they had to unlock it, but then they need to open it to pass through. So the next step should be to open the door after unlocking it. But the user tried to go east before opening it, which is why the game said they needed to open the door first. So the correct action would be to open the door again, then go east. But the user already unlocked it. Wait, maybe the game considers unlocking and opening as separate actions. So even though the door is unlocked, it's still closed and needs to be opened. So the user needs to open the door after unlocking it. Then, once it's open, they can go east. So the next step should be to open the door again. But the user tried to go east before that, which is why the game said they needed to open the door. So the correct action is to open the door again. But the user already unlocked it. Maybe the game's logic is that unlocking doesn't automatically open the door. So the user needs to open it. Therefore, the next action should be to open the door. But the user already has the key, so they can open it. So the next step is to open the door, then go east. But the user tried to go east before opening it, which is why the game said they needed to open it first. So the correct next action is to open the door again. But the user already unlocked it. Maybe the game is expecting the user to open the door, not just unlock it. So the user needs to open the door after unlocking it. Therefore, the next action should be to open the door. Then, after that, go east. So the user's next action should be to open the door again. But the user already unlocked it. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. But according to the game's response, the user needs to open the door first before going east. So the correct action is to open the door again. Therefore, the next command should be "open wooden door".

You are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.

You make out a closed refrigerator in the corner. You make out a counter. The counter is normal. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a stove. The stove is ordinary. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can see a kitchen island. Now why would someone leave that there? On the kitchen island you see a note. You shudder, but continue examining the room.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Okay, let me try to figure out what to do next. The user is in the Kitchen, and they need to open the screen door to go east. The previous attempt to go east was blocked because the screen door was closed. So the next logical step is to open the screen door. Once that's done, they can proceed east. Let me check if there's any other thing they need to do in the kitchen first. The user's goal is to pick up the milk from the garden, so maybe after opening the screen door, they can go east to the garden. But first, the screen door needs to be opened. So the correct action here is to open the screen door.

Since the user just arrived in the garden, the immediate next step is to pick up the milk. The command should be "pick up milk". That's the logical next move according to the instructions given.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the instructions step by step. They started in the bedroom, opened the trunk, got the key, unlocked the door, and went east to the kitchen. Then they opened the screen door, went east to the backyard, south to the garden, picked up the milk, and tried to go north again. Now they're back in the backyard, and the next step is to go west, as per the original plan.

Wait, the original goal was to pick up the milk in the garden, then go north, then west, then put the milk on the stove in the kitchen. But the user just went south again. Hmm. Let me check the current location. They're in the garden, and the next action should be to go north to return to the backyard, then west to the kitchen? Or maybe after picking up the milk, they needed to go north to the backyard, then west to the kitchen. But the user is currently in the garden, so after picking up the milk, they should go north to the backyard, then west to the kitchen.

But the user has been moving between the Backyard and Garden without making progress towards the final step.

In the Garden, there's a milk on the floor, which the user picked up. Then they tried going north to the Backyard, but the Backyard doesn't have the stove. The stove is in the Kitchen, which was previously visited. The user needs to get from the Garden back to the Kitchen to put the milk on the stove.

But the current path seems to be stuck. The user is repeatedly going south from the Backyard to the Garden and north back to the Backyard. They need to find a way back to the Kitchen. Let me check the previous steps.

Earlier, after opening the screen door in the Kitchen, the user went east to the Backyard. Then they went south to the Garden, picked up the milk, and tried to go north again. But the Kitchen is west of the Backyard, so maybe the user needs to go west from the Backyard to get back to the Kitchen.

Wait, in the Backyard description, there's an open screen door leading west. So from the Backyard, going west would take them back to the Kitchen. But the user was in the Garden, so they need to go north to the Backyard, then west to the Kitchen. Then they can put the milk on the stove.

But the user's last action was going north from the Garden to the Backyard again. So the next step should be to go west from the Backyard to the Kitchen. Then, in the Kitchen, they can put the milk on the stove. That would complete the task.

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.

You make out a closed refrigerator in the corner. You make out a counter. The counter is normal. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a stove. The stove is ordinary. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can see a kitchen island. Now why would someone leave that there? On the kitchen island you see a note. You shudder, but continue examining the room.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to complete a series of tasks in this text-based game. So far, they've opened the antique trunk, picked up the key, unlocked the door, opened the door, and moved through various rooms. They've picked up the milk in the garden and are now in the kitchen.

The current goal is to "sit the milk on the stove in the kitchen." The user tried "sit milk on stove" but got an error. The system probably doesn't recognize that command. So, I need to figure out the correct way to phrase that action.

In text adventures, commands are usually more straightforward. Instead of "sit milk on stove," maybe it's "put milk on stove" or "place milk on stove." The game might expect a specific verb. Since the user is holding the milk, the correct command is likely "put milk on stove."

Let me check the previous actions. The user was told to "sit the milk on the stove in the kitchen." So the correct command should be "put milk on stove" or "place milk on stove." The system might accept "put" as the verb. Let's go with "put milk on stove" as the next action.
