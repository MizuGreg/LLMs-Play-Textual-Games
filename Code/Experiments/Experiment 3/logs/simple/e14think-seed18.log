Welcome to TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, you could, like, open the chest drawer. Then, pick up the old key from the chest drawer. After picking up the old key, assure that the wooden door is unlocked. Then, ensure that the wooden door is open. After pulling open the wooden door, take a trip east. And then, make sure that the screen door is wide open. After that, make an effort to move east. With that done, attempt to take a trip south. Then, pick-up the bell pepper from the floor of the garden. And then, attempt to go to the north. If you can succeed at that, make an effort to take a trip west. And then, rest the bell pepper on the stove. Got that? Good!

-= Bedroom =-
You are in a bedroom. A standard kind of place.

You can make out a chest drawer. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You see a closed antique trunk close by. Look over there! a king-size bed. The king-size bed appears to be empty.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. A standard one.

You see a refrigerator. You check the price tag that's still affixed to the refrigerator. 100 bucks? What a deal! You'll have to ask where they got this! You see a counter. The counter is typical. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. Look over there! a kitchen island. You wonder idly who left that here. The kitchen island is usual. On the kitchen island you see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Backyard =-
You've entered a backyard. You can barely contain your excitement.

You scan the room for a set of chairs, and you find a set of chairs! The set of chairs is typical. But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? What's that over there? It looks like it's a bbq. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a bbq, go to TextWorld. However, the bbq, like an empty bbq, has nothing on it. You can see a patio table. The patio table is normal. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

There is an open screen door leading west. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

-= Living Room =-
You're now in a living room.

You can see a couch. On the couch you make out a tomato plant. You smell an intriguing smell, and follow it to a low table. The low table is ordinary. On the low table you see a remote. Huh, weird. You can see a tv. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hm. Oh well

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

You are in a bathroom. A normal one.

You make out a closed toilet right there by you. You see a bath. You make out a sink. The sink is standard. On the sink you make out a toothbrush.

You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps in the TextWorld game as described. They started in the bedroom, opened the chest drawer, picked up the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, went east to the kitchen, opened the screen door, went east again to the backyard, then south to the garden where they picked up the bell pepper. Then they went north back to the backyard, west to the kitchen, south to the living room, north again to the kitchen, and now they're in the bathroom.

The original goal was to pick up the bell pepper and rest it on the stove. The user has already picked up the bell pepper in the garden. The next step mentioned in the original task was to "attempt to go to the north" after picking up the bell pepper. Then, if successful, go west and rest the bell pepper on the stove.

But in the current state, the user is in the bathroom. The previous action was going north from the kitchen to the bathroom. Now, they need to figure out the next step. Since they are in the bathroom, the possible exits are south (back to the kitchen) or maybe other directions if available. But according to the current room description, the only exit mentioned is south. 

The user's next action should be to go south back to the kitchen. From there, they can try to rest the bell pepper on the stove. However, the stove is in the kitchen, and the user is holding the bell pepper. So the correct sequence would be to go south from the bathroom to the kitchen, then try to rest the bell pepper on the stove. But the user hasn't done that yet. 

Wait, in the kitchen, the description mentions a stove but says there's nothing on it. So the user needs to put the bell pepper there. The command would be "rest the bell pepper on the stove" once they are in the kitchen. But the user is currently in the bathroom, so they need to go back to the kitchen first. Therefore, the next action is to go south from the bathroom to the kitchen. Then, once in the kitchen, rest the bell pepper on the stove. 

But the user's last action was going north to the bathroom. So the next step is to go south back to the kitchen. That's the logical next move.
