I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First off, ensure that the antique trunk within the bedroom is open. After that, recover the old key from the antique trunk. After that, make it so that the wooden door in the bedroom is unlocked with the old key. And then, make absolutely sure that the wooden door inside the bedroom is ajar. After opening the wooden door, go east. Then, doublecheck that the screen door is wide open. And then, attempt to travel east. And then, try to travel south. With that done, lift the milk from the floor of the garden. After stealing the milk, head north. And then, attempt to travel west. With that done, rest the milk on the stove. That's it!

-= Bedroom =-
I am sorry to announce that you are now in the bedroom. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a chest drawer. You scan the room for an antique trunk, and you find an antique trunk. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to a king-size bed. The king-size bed is standard. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. You think about smashing the king-size bed to bits, throwing the bits in the dump, etc, until you get bored.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text adventure game, and they've followed a series of steps to reach the garden. The current task is to lift the milk from the floor of the garden. But when they tried to take the milk, the game said they can't see any such thing. Hmm, maybe the milk isn't visible because it's under something else or maybe it's in a different location.

Looking back at the previous steps, the user was in the garden, and the description mentioned that there's a milk, a half of a bag of chips, a lettuce, and a shovel on the floor. Wait, but when the user tried to take the milk, it said they can't see it. That's confusing because the description explicitly states the milk is on the floor. Maybe there's a typo or a misunderstanding in the game's response. Alternatively, maybe the milk is hidden under another object, like the shovel or the lettuce. 

The user's next action should be to check if the milk is indeed there. Since the game's description says it's on the floor, perhaps the user needs to pick it up directly. But the game's response said they can't see it. Maybe the correct command is to pick it up regardless, or maybe there's another step needed. The user's previous action was "take milk from floor," which didn't work. Maybe the correct command is just "take milk" without specifying the floor, or maybe they need to use a different verb like "pick up."

Alternatively, maybe the milk is in a container, but the description says it's on the floor. The user might need to check again. But since the game's response says they can't see it, perhaps there's an error. However, the user's task is to follow the instructions given in the initial prompt. The original task was to lift the milk from the floor. So even if the game says they can't see it, the user should try taking it again. Maybe the game's response was a mistake, or maybe the user needs to use a different command. The correct action here would be to try taking the milk again, perhaps using "take milk" instead of specifying the floor. But according to the initial instructions, the user is supposed to lift the milk from the floor. So maybe the correct command is "take milk from floor" again, but the game didn't recognize it. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check the inventory or look around again. But the user's next action should be to take the milk, even if the game says they can't see it. The user might have to proceed despite the error. So the next action would be "take milk" or "pick up milk."

Okay, the user is stuck in the Garden scene trying to pick up the milk. They've tried "take milk from floor" multiple times, but the game keeps saying they can't see it. Let me check the game's description again.

In the Garden description, it says: "There is a milk, a half of a bag of chips, a lettuce and a shovel on the floor." So the milk is explicitly on the floor. The user's issue might be that the game's parser isn't recognizing "take" as the correct verb. Maybe they need to use "pick up" instead. But the user has tried "pick up milk from floor" and it's not working. Wait, maybe the correct command is just "take milk" without specifying the floor, since the milk is on the floor by default. Alternatively, the game might require the user to use "get" instead of "take." But the user has tried "take" and "pick up" already. 

Looking at the previous interactions, the user tried "take milk from floor" and the game responded with "You can't see any such thing." But according to the game's description, the milk is there. This might be a bug in the game's parser. However, since the user is following the initial instructions, they need to proceed with the correct command as per the game's expectations. Maybe the correct command is simply "take milk" without specifying the floor, as the floor is the default location. Let me try that. If that doesn't work, perhaps the user needs to check if the milk is hidden under another object, but the description says it's on the floor. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use "get" instead of "take." But the user has already tried "pick up." 

Given the game's responses, it's possible that the correct command is "take milk" without the "from floor" part. So the next action should be "take milk."

You can see a closed refrigerator in the room. You can make out a counter. The counter is usual. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. You scan the room, seeing a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. You can see a kitchen island. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? On the kitchen island you can see a note.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Kitchen and Bathroom, repeatedly going north and south. The original goal was to lift the milk, rest it on the stove, and then do other tasks. But the user has already picked up the milk in the Garden. The current step is to head north, but it's leading them back to the Bathroom, which is part of the same house.

Wait, the user's last action was going north from the Kitchen to the Bathroom, then south back to Kitchen. This seems like a loop. The original task after picking up the milk was to head north and then travel west. But maybe the user is getting confused with the directions.

Looking back, after picking up the milk in the Garden, the next steps were to head north, then west. But in the current scenario, the user is going back and forth between Kitchen and Bathroom. Maybe the user needs to check the current location's exits again. In the Kitchen, there's an exit to the south, but the user is going north instead. Perhaps the correct path is to go west from the Kitchen, but the user is going north. Wait, the Kitchen has an open wooden door leading west and an open screen door leading east. The user might have been supposed to go west from the Kitchen to the Backyard, then to the Garden again. But the user is going north instead, which leads to the Bathroom.

This suggests that the user might be following the wrong path. The original task after the Garden was to head north, but that might not be the correct direction. The user needs to go back to the Backyard via the west door in the Kitchen. So the correct next action should be to go west from the Kitchen, not north. But the user is repeatedly going north, leading to the Bathroom. Therefore, the user needs to correct their direction and go west from the Kitchen to the Backyard, then proceed to the Garden again. However, the user's current location is the Kitchen, so the next command should be "go west" to exit to the Backyard. Then, from the Backyard, go south to the Garden again. But the user is stuck in the loop, so the correct action is to go west from the Kitchen.

I am sorry to announce that you are now in the bedroom. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a chest drawer. You scan the room for an antique trunk, and you find an antique trunk. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The antique trunk is empty! What a waste of a day! You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to a king-size bed. The king-size bed is standard. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. You think about smashing the king-size bed to bits, throwing the bits in the dump, etc, until you get bored.

Of every kitchen you could have sauntered into, you had to walk into an ordinary one. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You can see a closed refrigerator in the room. You can make out a counter. The counter is usual. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. You scan the room, seeing a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. You can see a kitchen island. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? On the kitchen island you can see a note.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

I am sorry to announce that you are now in the bedroom. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a chest drawer. You scan the room for an antique trunk, and you find an antique trunk. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The antique trunk is empty! What a waste of a day! You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to a king-size bed. The king-size bed is standard. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. You think about smashing the king-size bed to bits, throwing the bits in the dump, etc, until you get bored.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Kitchen, Bathroom, and Bedroom. They keep going back and forth, which is preventing them from progressing towards the original goal. The original task was to lift the milk, rest it on the stove, and then do other steps. But the user has already picked up the milk in the Garden. The current issue is that they're not moving forward correctly.

Looking at the current location, the user is in the Kitchen. The exits are east (screen door), west (wooden door), north (unblocked), and south (exit). The user needs to go west from the Kitchen to the Backyard, then south to the Garden again. However, the user is repeatedly going north, which leads to the Bathroom, then back to the Kitchen. This loop is causing them to get stuck.

The correct next action should be to go west from the Kitchen to the Backyard. Once there, they can go south to the Garden. But the user is not doing that. They need to break the cycle and go west. So the next command should be "go west" to exit the Kitchen and proceed to the Backyard. Then, from the Backyard, go south to the Garden again. But since the user is in the Kitchen, the immediate next step is to go west.

You arrive in a bathroom. A typical kind of place.

You see a closed ordinary looking toilet in the room. You see a bath. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? Hey, want to see a sink? Look over there, a sink. The sink is ordinary. On the sink you can make out a toothbrush.

There is an unblocked exit to the south.

I am sorry to announce that you are now in the bedroom. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a chest drawer. You scan the room for an antique trunk, and you find an antique trunk. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The antique trunk is empty! What a waste of a day! You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to a king-size bed. The king-size bed is standard. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. You think about smashing the king-size bed to bits, throwing the bits in the dump, etc, until you get bored.

There is an open wooden door leading east.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Kitchen, Bathroom, and Bedroom. They keep going back and forth, which is preventing them from progressing towards the original goal. The original task was to lift the milk, rest it on the stove, and then do other steps. But the user has already picked up the milk in the Garden. The current issue is that they're not moving forward correctly.

Looking at the current location, the user is in the Kitchen. The exits are east (screen door), west (wooden door), north (unblocked), and south (exit). The user needs to go west from the Kitchen to the Backyard, then south to the Garden again. However, the user is repeatedly going north, which leads to the Bathroom, then back to the Kitchen. This loop is causing them to get stuck.

The correct next action should be to go west from the Kitchen to the Backyard. Once there, they can go south to the Garden again. But since the user is in the Kitchen, the immediate next step is to go west.

-= Kitchen =-
Of every kitchen you could have sauntered into, you had to walk into an ordinary one. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You can see a closed refrigerator in the room. You can make out a counter. The counter is usual. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. You scan the room, seeing a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. You can see a kitchen island. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? On the kitchen island you can see a note.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

-= Bathroom =-
You arrive in a bathroom. A typical kind of place.

You see a closed ordinary looking toilet in the room. You see a bath. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? Hey, want to see a sink? Look over there, a sink. The sink is ordinary. On the sink you can make out a toothbrush.

There is an unblocked exit to the south.
