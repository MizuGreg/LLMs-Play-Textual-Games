It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First thing I need you to do is to make absolutely sure that the antique trunk is opened. And then, take the old key from the antique trunk within the bedroom. After that, check that the wooden door within the bedroom is unlocked with the old key. After that, look and see that the wooden door is open. After that, try to move east. After that, open the screen door in the kitchen. And then, venture east. Then, attempt to travel south. And then, lift the lettuce from the floor of the garden. If you have picked up the lettuce, travel north. And then, try to move west. Then, rest the lettuce on the stove. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Bedroom =-
I am excited to announce that you are now in the bedroom. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You make out a chest drawer. Hmm. You always thought you'd be more excited to see a chest drawer in a room. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to an antique trunk. You can make out a king-size bed. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this TextWorld game and has already completed some steps. They opened the antique trunk, took the old key, and now they need to unlock the wooden door in the bedroom. The next step according to the original task was to check that the door is unlocked with the old key. So the next action should be to unlock the door.

Wait, the user has the key, so they need to use it on the door. The command would be "unlock wooden door with old key". But in the game's context, maybe it's just "unlock wooden door" since the key is in their inventory. Let me check the previous steps. The user took the old key from the trunk, so they have it. The door is closed, so they need to unlock it. The correct command here is "unlock wooden door". Then after that, they need to open the door. So the next step is to unlock the door with the key. The user's next action should be "unlock wooden door".

Okay, let's see. The user has successfully unlocked and opened the wooden door in the bedroom. The next step according to the original task was to move east after opening the door. So the next action should be "go east". The user needs to move east from the bedroom. The command is straightforward. Let me make sure there are no other steps in between. The original instructions said after opening the door, try to move east. So "go east" is the next correct command.

You've just sauntered into a kitchen. Let's see what's in here.

Were you looking for a refrigerator? Because look over there, it's a refrigerator. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. The counter is usual. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. Hm. Oh well You make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. You can make out a kitchen island. The kitchen island is normal. On the kitchen island you can make out a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a set of chairs. The set of chairs is usual. The set of chairs appears to be empty. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a bbq. Now why would someone leave that there? The bbq is typical. But there isn't a thing on it. You scan the room for a patio table, and you find a patio table. You shudder, but continue examining the patio table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

There is an open screen door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

Let me check the previous steps. The user has already picked up the lettuce, but wait, the score is at 8/9. Wait, the user needs to pick up the lettuce first. The instruction says: "lift the lettuce from the floor of the garden. If you have picked up the lettuce, travel north. And then, try to move west. Then, rest the lettuce on the stove.

But wait, the original instructions said after picking up the lettuce, travel north, then try to move west. So after going north, the next action should be "go west". But the user is now in the Backyard again. Let me check the current location. The user is in the Backyard, and the next step is to move west. The command would be "go west". However, the user needs to rest the lettuce on the stove. Wait, the stove is in the Kitchen. So maybe after moving west, they need to go back to the Kitchen. But the current room is the Backyard, which has a screen door leading west (to the Kitchen?) or maybe the Kitchen is elsewhere. Wait, the previous steps: the user went from Garden to Backyard via north. The Backyard has a screen door leading west, which might lead back to the Kitchen. Then, once in the Kitchen, they can rest the lettuce on the stove. So the next action is "go west" to reach the Kitchen, then rest the lettuce.

Okay, the user tried to "rest lettuce on stove" but the game didn't recognize it. So I need to figure out the correct command. In TextWorld, commands are usually verbs like "put" or "place". The user has the lettuce in their inventory, so maybe the correct action is "put lettuce on stove". Let me check the previous steps. The user picked up the lettuce, then went north to the Backyard, then west to the Kitchen. Now, in the Kitchen, they need to place the lettuce on the stove. The correct command is likely "put lettuce on stove". The game might not accept "rest", so switching to "put" would be better. Let me confirm the possible actions. The stove is in the Kitchen, so "put" is the right verb here. The next action should be "put lettuce on stove".
