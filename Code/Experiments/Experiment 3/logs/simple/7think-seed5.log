You are now playing a life changing session of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First thing I need you to do is to assure that the chest drawer in the bedroom is open. Then, retrieve the old key from the chest drawer in the bedroom. After that, unlock the wooden door with the old key. And then, ensure that the wooden door in the bedroom is open. After that, make an attempt to move east. Following that, open the refrigerator. And then, pick up the apple from the refrigerator. After that, rest the apple on the stove. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Bedroom =-
You are in a bedroom. A normal one. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You make out a chest drawer. You can make out an antique trunk. You smell a wretched smell, and follow it to a king-size bed. The king-size bed is standard. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

-= Kitchen =-
Ah, the kitchen. This is some kind of kitchen, really great standard vibes in this place, a wonderful standard atmosphere. And now, well, you're in it.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a refrigerator. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. The counter appears to be empty. You see a stove. The stove is usual. But there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is standard. On the kitchen island you see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps in the TextWorld game. They started by opening the chest drawer in the bedroom, retrieving the old key, unlocking and opening the wooden door, then moving east to the kitchen. Now they're in the kitchen, which has a refrigerator and a stove.

The next step according to the original plan was to open the refrigerator. The user just did that and found a milk and an apple. Now, the next task is to pick up the apple from the refrigerator. The user needs to take the apple, so the command should be "take apple from refrigerator". 

But wait, the user's last action was "open refrigerator", and the response showed the apple is inside. So the next logical step is to take the apple. The user's score is now at 6/7, so they need to proceed carefully. The next command should be "take apple from refrigerator" to pick it up. Then, after that, they need to rest the apple on the stove. So after taking the apple, the next step would be moving to the stove and putting it there. But the current prompt is asking for the next action after opening the refrigerator. So the immediate next step is to take the apple.
