It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First step, open the chest drawer within the bedroom. And then, take the old key from the chest drawer in the bedroom. If you can get your hands on the old key, insert the old key into the wooden door's lock to unlock it. Then, ensure that the wooden door is open. After that, travel east. Then, open the screen door. Then, go to the east. Then, attempt to travel south. If you can manage that, lift the lettuce from the floor of the garden. And then, head north. Then, try to travel west. Following that, rest the lettuce on the stove. That's it!

-= Bedroom =-
Okay, so you're in a bedroom, cool, but is it standard? You better believe it is.

Hey, want to see a chest drawer? Look over there, a chest drawer. Oh, great. Here's an antique trunk. You see a king-size bed. The king-size bed is typical. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me figure out what the next step should be. The user has already inserted the old key into the wooden door's lock. The next part of the original instructions was to "ensure that the wooden door is open." So after inserting the key, the logical next action would be to unlock the door. But wait, the user just inserted the key, so maybe the door is now unlocked. The original instructions said to "insert the old key into the wooden door's lock to unlock it." So after inserting the key, the door should be unlocked. Then the next step was to "ensure that the wooden door is open," which might mean opening it if it's locked. But if inserting the key already unlocked it, then maybe the next step is to open the door.

Wait, the user's last action was inserting the key into the lock. The response was a bit confusing, but the user's next thought is to check if they're on the right track. The original plan was: insert key into lock to unlock, then ensure the door is open. So after inserting the key, the door should be unlocked. Then the user needs to open the door. So the next action should be to open the wooden door. Let me check the previous steps again.

The user took the key from the chest, inserted it into the lock. Now, the next step according to the original instructions is to "ensure that the wooden door is open." So the user needs to open the door. Therefore, the next command should be "open wooden door."

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text adventure game. They started in the bedroom, opened the chest drawer, took the old key, inserted it into the door's lock, and then tried to unlock it. The system message said they had to unlock the door first, so they did that. Now they're in the bedroom again, and the next step is to go east.

Wait, the user just tried to go east, but the system said they have to open the wooden door first. So the correct action here is to open the door again. But they already unlocked it, so maybe they need to check if it's open. But the previous action was unlocking, which should open the door. Maybe the system is confused. But according to the last message, the user tried to go east but was told to open the door first. So the next action should be to open the door again. But the user already did that. Hmm, maybe there's a mistake in the system's message. But the user is supposed to follow the instructions. So the next step is to go east after the door is open. But the system is preventing them from going east until the door is open. So the correct action is to open the door again, but since they already unlocked it, maybe the door is open. Wait, the user's last action was unlocking the door, which should open it. So perhaps the system is incorrect, but the user needs to proceed. The next step is to go east. But the system says they have to open the door first. So maybe the user needs to open the door again. But that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check if the door is open. But the system's message is conflicting. The user's next action should be to go east, but the system says they need to open the door first. So the correct action is to open the door again. But the user already did that. This is confusing. However, the user's last action was unlocking the door, so the door should be open. Therefore, the next action is to go east. But the system is preventing that. So maybe the user should proceed to go east despite the message. But the user is supposed to follow the system's instructions. So the next action is to open the door again. But that's redundant. Alternatively, maybe the system's message is a mistake, and the user should go east. But the user is supposed to follow the instructions. So the next action is to go east. But the system says they have to open the door first. So the user needs to open the door again. But that's already done. This is a bit of a loop. However, the user's next action should be to go east, as per the original plan. So the answer is go east.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the steps in the TextWorld game. They started by opening the chest drawer in the bedroom, taking the old key, inserting it into the wooden door's lock, and unlocking the door. Then they tried to go east, but the game keeps reminding them to open the wooden door first.

Wait, maybe there's a confusion here. The user already unlocked the door, right? The previous response said "That's unlocked at the moment." So maybe the door is already open. But the game is prompting them to open it again. That might be a glitch or a misunderstanding in the game's feedback. 

The user's next action should be to proceed east after the door is unlocked. Since the door is already unlocked, the correct step is to go east. The game might be checking if the door is open, but since it's already unlocked, they can move through it. So the next command should be "go east" again, even though the game is nagging them to open it first. Maybe the game's message is incorrect, but the user needs to follow the steps as instructed. 

Alternatively, maybe the door is closed despite being unlocked. But according to the last message, the door is unlocked. So the user should proceed east. The answer should be "go east" again.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in the game because they keep getting told they need to open the wooden door before going east. They've already unlocked the door, but maybe they're not using the correct command. The previous attempts to "go east" were failing because the door wasn't open. The correct action should be to open the door first. The user might be confused between "unlock" and "open". Since the door is already unlocked, the next step is to open it. So the right command here is "open wooden door".

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps in the TextWorld game. They started in the bedroom, opened the chest drawer, took the old key, unlocked the door, and then went east to the kitchen. Then they went north to the bathroom. Now, they're in the bathroom and need to decide their next move.

The original goal was to lift the lettuce from the garden, rest it on the stove, and so on. But so far, the user has only reached the bathroom. The path to the garden probably involves going south from the kitchen, but the user was in the bathroom after going north from the kitchen. Wait, the kitchen had a screen door east and a door west. The user went north from the kitchen to the bathroom. Now, in the bathroom, the only unblocked door is south. So going south would take them back to the kitchen. But the original plan was to go east from the kitchen, then south to the garden. Maybe the user needs to go back to the kitchen, open the screen door, and then proceed to the garden. But the user is in the bathroom now, so the next step should be to go south back to the kitchen. Then from the kitchen, go east through the screen door to the garden. But the user's last action was going north to the bathroom, so the next logical step is to go south back to the kitchen. Then proceed to the garden. But the user hasn't mentioned the garden yet. So the correct next action is to go south from the bathroom back to the kitchen. Then from the kitchen, go east through the screen door to the garden. But the user is in the bathroom, so the immediate next action is to go south.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game where they have to follow a series of steps to reach the goal. So far, they've navigated through the bedroom, unlocked the door, and moved to the kitchen and bathroom, looping back. The current location is the kitchen again.

The original goal mentioned in the initial prompt was to get the old key, unlock the door, go east, open the screen door, go east again, travel south to get the lettuce, then north, west, and rest the lettuce on the stove. But the user has been moving between rooms without completing all the steps. 

In the kitchen, there's a note on the kitchen island. The user hasn't picked up the lettuce yet, which is in the garden. The next steps after getting the lettuce involve moving to the garden, resting it on the stove. But the user is currently in the kitchen, so maybe they need to go south to the garden. However, the previous attempt to go south led back to the kitchen. Wait, the kitchen has an unguarded exit to the south. Maybe that's the garden. But the user hasn't found the lettuce yet. 

The user's current score is 5/18, which suggests they've completed some steps but not all. The key steps remaining are getting the lettuce from the garden and placing it on the stove. Since the user is in the kitchen, they need to go south to the garden, pick up the lettuce, then return north to the kitchen and place it on the stove. 

But the user has been looping between kitchen and bathroom, so they might need to find the correct path. The screen door east in the kitchen might lead to the garden. Alternatively, the unguarded exit to the south could be the garden. The user needs to check those options. 

The next action should be to go south from the kitchen to reach the garden where the lettuce is. So the correct command would be "go south" again to proceed to the garden and pick up the lettuce.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game where they have to follow a series of steps to complete a goal. The goal mentioned earlier was to lift the lettuce from the garden and then rest it on the stove. But so far, the user has been moving between rooms: bedroom, kitchen, bathroom, living room, and back and forth.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the bathroom again. The previous actions involved moving north and south between rooms, but they haven't encountered the garden or the lettuce yet. The original plan was to go east after opening the door, then travel south to the garden, pick up the lettuce, and then head north and west to rest it on the stove.

Wait, the user has been stuck in a loop between the kitchen and bathroom. They need to get to the garden. The garden is probably east of the kitchen, since there's a screen door leading east in the kitchen. The user hasn't tried going east from the kitchen yet. The screen door is closed, so they might need to open it. But the current location is the bathroom, so they need to go back to the kitchen, open the screen door, go east to the garden, then proceed with the lettuce task.

But the user's last action was going north from the kitchen to the bathroom. Now they're in the bathroom again. The next step should be to go south back to the kitchen, then open the screen door east, move to the garden, pick up the lettuce, and then proceed to the stove. However, the user hasn't yet reached the garden, so they need to follow the correct path. The key is to avoid getting stuck in loops and instead move towards the garden and then the stove.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Kitchen again, moving between rooms. The goal was to get the lettuce from the garden. So far, they've navigated through Bedroom, Bathroom, Kitchen, Living Room, and back. They need to get to the garden.

The current location is the Kitchen. The note on the kitchen island might have clues. The user needs to find the lettuce in the garden. The next step is probably to go east through the screen door. But the user has been going back and forth between Kitchen and Bathroom. Maybe they need to go east from the Kitchen. The screen door is closed, so they need to open it. But the user hasn't done that yet. Alternatively, maybe the lettuce is in the garden, which is south of the Kitchen. But the user hasn't gone south yet. Wait, the Kitchen has an unguarded exit to the south. So maybe go south to the garden. But the user hasn't tried that yet. Let me check the previous steps. The user was told to go east after opening the door, then travel south to the garden. So maybe the garden is south of the Kitchen. So the next action should be to go south. But the user is stuck in a loop between Kitchen and Bathroom. So the correct next step is to go south from the Kitchen to reach the garden where the lettuce is. So the answer is go south.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game where they have to follow a series of steps to reach the goal. The current scenario is in the Bathroom, and they need to go south. The user has been repeatedly moving between rooms, but they might be stuck in a loop.

Looking at the history, the user has been going back and forth between the Kitchen, Bathroom, and Living Room. The goal mentioned earlier was to lift the lettuce from the garden, but the current path doesn't seem to involve that. Maybe the user hasn't found the garden yet.

Wait, the original instructions said after opening the wooden door and going east, they should open the screen door, then go east again, travel south, lift the lettuce, then head north, west, and rest the lettuce on the stove. But the user hasn't reached the garden part yet. They're stuck in a loop between rooms without progressing towards the garden.

The user's score is at 5, which might indicate they haven't completed enough steps. The key steps missing are moving to the garden, lifting the lettuce, and then proceeding to the stove. Since the current location is the Bathroom, the next logical step would be to go south to the Living Room, then maybe find a way to the garden. But the Living Room exit is north, which leads back to the Kitchen. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the screen door in the Kitchen (east) is the way to go. The user hasn't opened that yet. So perhaps the next action should be to open the screen door east in the Kitchen. But the user's last action was going south to the Bathroom. So maybe they need to go back to the Kitchen, open the screen door, then proceed east to the garden.

But the user's last command was "go south" again, which leads back to the Bathroom. It seems like they're not making progress towards the garden. The correct path would be from the Kitchen, go east through the screen door to reach the garden. So the user needs to go back to the Kitchen, open the screen door, then go east. But in the current state, they're in the Bathroom, so they need to go south to the Living Room, then north back to the Kitchen, then east through the screen door.

But the user might not be aware of the need to open the screen door. The original instructions said to open the screen door after going east. So maybe the user needs to go east from the Kitchen, but the screen door is closed. So the next step should be to open the screen door in the Kitchen, then go east to the garden.

But in the current state, the user is in the Bathroom. So the correct sequence is: go south to Living Room, then north to Kitchen, then east to open the screen door, then proceed east to the garden. Then lift the lettuce, etc.

However, the user's last action was "go south" again, which is leading them back to the Bathroom. They might need to navigate back to the Kitchen and then proceed east. The key is to get to the garden, which is likely east of the Kitchen via the screen door. So the next step should be to go back to the Kitchen, open the screen door, then go east. But the user is in the Bathroom, so they need to go south to the Living Room, then north to the Kitchen. Then open the screen door and go east.

Okay, let's see. The user has been moving between rooms in the TextWorld game. They started in the bedroom, opened the chest drawer, took the old key, unlocked the door, and then kept going back and forth between the kitchen, bathroom, and living room. The goal mentioned earlier was to lift the lettuce from the garden, but so far, the user hasn't found any lettuce.

Looking at the current room, which is the kitchen, the description mentions a kitchen island with a note. The user hasn't interacted with the note yet. The previous actions were mostly moving between rooms, but maybe the note on the kitchen island is part of the next step. However, the user's score hasn't increased since the kitchen was visited, so maybe there's something else to do here.

Wait, the original plan was to go east, open the screen door, go east again, travel south to the garden, lift the lettuce, then north, west, and rest the lettuce on the stove. But the user is stuck in a loop between kitchen and bathroom. Maybe they need to check the kitchen island for the note, which might be a clue. Alternatively, maybe the screen door in the kitchen (east) is the way to go. The user tried going east but got stuck again. Maybe they need to open the screen door first. But the screen door is closed. So the next logical step would be to open the screen door leading east in the kitchen. Let me check the previous interactions.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Garden room. The description mentions there's a milk, lettuce, a half bag of chips, and a shovel on the floor. The original goal was to lift the lettuce from the floor of the garden and then rest it on the stove. 

Wait, the user had previously gone through several rooms, unlocked doors, and now is in the Garden. The next step according to the initial instructions was to lift the lettuce after traveling south. So the user needs to pick up the lettuce here.

But the current room is the Garden, and the user is supposed to lift the lettuce. The command should be "take lettuce". But the user might have missed that step earlier. Let me check the previous actions. The user was told to "lift the lettuce from the floor of the garden" after traveling south. So in the Garden room, the lettuce is on the floor. The correct action here is to take the lettuce. Then, after that, they need to go north to the stove. But the user's next action should be to take the lettuce. However, the user's last action was "go south", which led them to the Garden. Now, the next step is to pick up the lettuce. So the correct command is "take lettuce".

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Garden room, and the goal is to lift the lettuce from the floor. The previous attempts to take or lift the lettuce didn't work. The message says "You can't see any such thing" when trying to take it, and "That's not a verb I recognise" when trying to lift it.

So, maybe the correct action is to first pick up the lettuce. But the user tried "take lettuce from floor" and it didn't work. Then they tried "lift lettuce from floor", which also didn't work. The problem might be that the lettuce is on the floor, so the correct command is "take lettuce" without specifying the floor, or maybe "get lettuce".

Wait, in some text adventures, you have to use "take" or "get" followed by the item. Since the lettuce is on the floor, maybe the correct command is just "take lettuce". Let me check the previous messages. The user tried "take lettuce from floor" which failed. Then "lift lettuce from floor" also failed. The system message says there's a lettuce on the floor. So maybe the correct command is "take lettuce" without the "from floor" part. Alternatively, maybe "get lettuce".

But the user's last attempt was "lift lettuce from floor", which the system rejected. So the next step is to try "take lettuce" or "get lettuce". Since the user previously tried "take lettuce from floor" and it didn't work, maybe the correct command is just "take lettuce". Let me try that.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user has been navigating through different rooms in the TextWorld game. Their goal seems to be to collect items and move through the areas as per the initial instructions. They started in the bedroom, found the old key, unlocked the door, and moved through various rooms like the kitchen, bathroom, living room, backyard, and garden.

In the garden, they picked up the lettuce, which was part of the original goal. Now, they need to rest the lettuce on the stove. The current location is the kitchen, where there's a stove mentioned. The user has the lettuce, so the next logical step is to go to the stove and place the lettuce there. The previous action was going west back to the kitchen. Now, they should proceed to the stove and put the lettuce down. The correct command would be "put lettuce on stove" or similar. But since the game might require specific verbs, "rest lettuce on stove" could be the right command. Let me check the previous interactions. The user was told to "rest the lettuce on the stove" in the original instructions. So the correct action here is to do that.

That's not a verb I recognise.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to rest the lettuce on the stove. The previous attempt to use "rest lettuce on stove" was rejected because it's not a recognized verb. So, I need to figure out the correct command.

In text adventures, common verbs for placing items are "put" or "place". The user has the lettuce in hand, so maybe the correct command is "put lettuce on stove". Let me check the game's context. The user was told to "rest the lettuce on the stove" after picking it up. But the game might expect "put" instead of "rest". 

Also, the user has been using commands like "take lettuce from floor" which worked. So maybe "put lettuce on stove" is the right verb here. The game's response was that "rest" isn't a valid verb, so the correct action is to use "put". 

Therefore, the next action should be "put lettuce on stove".
