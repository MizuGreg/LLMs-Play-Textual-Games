I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, open the antique trunk. And then, retrieve the old key from the antique trunk. With the old key, unlock the wooden door inside the bedroom with the old key. Then, ensure that the wooden door is open. And then, head east. After that, ensure that the screen door is open. And then, head east. And then, try to move south. And then, pick-up the bell pepper from the floor of the garden. With the bell pepper, attempt to head north. With that accomplished, go to the west. And then, place the bell pepper on the stove. Alright, thanks!

-= Bedroom =-
Ah, the bedroom. This is some kind of bedroom, really great normal vibes in this place, a wonderful normal atmosphere. You can barely contain your excitement.

You can make out a closed chest drawer in the room. You can see a closed antique trunk nearby. You make out a king-size bed. The king-size bed is normal. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

You are in a kitchen. It seems to be pretty usual here.

Were you looking for a refrigerator? Because look over there, it's a refrigerator. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. The counter appears to be empty. You scan the room, seeing a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is typical. On the kitchen island you make out a note. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game called TextWorld, and they've been following a set of instructions to complete various tasks. The current situation is in the Garden, where they need to pick up the bell pepper from the floor. The user tried "pick up the bell pepper from the floor" but got a response saying they can't see any such thing. Then they tried "take the bell pepper from the floor" and got a similar response.

Hmm, maybe the correct command is just "take the bell pepper" without specifying "from the floor" since the game might automatically recognize that the bell pepper is on the floor. Alternatively, maybe the game expects a different phrasing. Let me check the previous interactions. The user first tried "pick up the bell pepper from the floor," which the game didn't recognize. Then they tried "take the bell pepper from the floor," which also didn't work. The game's response was "You can't see any such thing." So perhaps the bell pepper isn't actually on the floor, or the command is incorrect.

Wait, looking back at the Garden description: "There is a milk, a half of a bag of chips, a bell pepper and a shovel on the floor." So the bell pepper is indeed on the floor. The user needs to pick it up. The correct command might be "take the bell pepper" or "pick up the bell pepper." The previous attempts used "pick up" and "take" with "from the floor," but the game didn't recognize it. Maybe the game doesn't require specifying "from the floor" because the bell pepper is on the floor by default. So the correct command is just "take the bell pepper" or "pick up the bell pepper."

But the user tried "take the bell pepper from the floor" and got a negative response. Maybe the game expects the command without the "from the floor" part. Let me try that. The next action should be "take the bell pepper" or "pick up the bell pepper." Since the user previously tried "pick up the bell pepper from the floor" and got a response that the game didn't recognize, maybe the correct command is just "take the bell pepper."

Alternatively, maybe the game is case-sensitive or has specific syntax. Let me check the previous commands. The user used "take the old key from the antique trunk" which worked. So maybe the correct command here is "take the bell pepper from the floor," but the game didn't recognize it. Wait, the game's response was "You can't see any such thing." That suggests that the game doesn't see the bell pepper, but according to the description, it's on the floor. Maybe there's a typo or misunderstanding. Alternatively, maybe the game requires the player to use the correct verb. Since "take" is a valid verb, perhaps the correct command is "take the bell pepper."

But the user tried "take the bell pepper from the floor" and it didn't work. Maybe the game doesn't require the "from the floor" part. Let me try "take the bell pepper" without the "from the floor." That might be the correct command. So the next action should be "take the bell pepper."

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to put the bell pepper on the stove in the Garden. But the game says they can't see any such thing. Wait, earlier in the Garden, the items on the floor were milk, half a bag of chips, a bell pepper, and a shovel. The stove is in the Kitchen, right? The user was in the Garden, then went back to the Backyard, then back to the Garden. But the stove is in the Kitchen. So maybe the stove isn't in the Garden. The user is in the Garden, but the stove is in the Kitchen. So putting the bell pepper on the stove in the Garden is impossible because the stove isn't there. Therefore, the correct action would be to go to the Kitchen where the stove is located. So the next step should be to go north to reach the Kitchen and then put the bell pepper on the stove there. But the user is currently in the Garden, so they need to go north to the Kitchen. Let me check the previous steps. The user was in the Garden, then went south to the Backyard, then back to the Garden. The Garden's description says to try going north. So the correct next action is to go north to the Kitchen, then put the bell pepper on the stove there. But the user is stuck in the Garden, so they need to move to the Kitchen first. Therefore, the next command should be "go north" to reach the Kitchen, then "put the bell pepper on the stove".

-= Backyard =-
You've just shown up in a backyard.

You can see a set of chairs. However, the set of chairs, like an empty set of chairs, has nothing on it. You move on, clearly done caring about TextWorld. You can make out a bbq. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can see a patio table. The patio table is typical. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is an open screen door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, the user is stuck in the Garden, trying to put the bell pepper on the stove. But the stove isn't in the Garden. The stove is in the Kitchen. The user has been moving between the Garden and Backyard, but hasn't gone to the Kitchen yet. The correct path is to go north from the Garden to reach the Kitchen, then put the bell pepper on the stove. However, the user keeps getting stuck in the Garden and Backyard, not moving north to the Kitchen. The previous attempts to go north were unsuccessful because the user was in the Garden and tried to go north again, but the game's descriptions are confusing. The user needs to find the correct path to the Kitchen. The next step should be to go north from the Garden to reach the Kitchen, then put the bell pepper on the stove. But since the user is currently in the Garden, the correct command is "go north" to reach the Kitchen.

Okay, the user is stuck in the Backyard and keeps trying to go north, but the game says they can't. Earlier, they were in the Garden, tried to go north to the Kitchen, but maybe the path is blocked or they need to find another way. Let me check the previous steps.

The user started in the Bedroom, opened the trunk, got the key, unlocked the door, went east to the Kitchen, then east again to the Backyard. Now, in the Backyard, they can't go north. The Kitchen is probably east of the Backyard, but the user is trying to go north instead. Wait, maybe the correct direction to the Kitchen is east, not north. But the user has been going east from the Kitchen to the Backyard. So maybe the user is in the Backyard, and the Kitchen is to the west. But the Backyard's description says to try going south. Hmm, this is confusing. The user needs to find the correct path back to the Kitchen. Maybe they need to go west from the Backyard to the Kitchen. But the Backyard's description says there's an open screen door leading west. So the user should go west instead of north. But the user kept trying to go north. So the correct command is "go west" to return to the Kitchen. Then, once in the Kitchen, they can put the bell pepper on the stove. So the next action should be "go west" to reach the Kitchen.

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. It seems to be pretty usual here.

Were you looking for a refrigerator? Because look over there, it's a refrigerator. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. The counter appears to be empty. You scan the room, seeing a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is typical. On the kitchen island you make out a note. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.
