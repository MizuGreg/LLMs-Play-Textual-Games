I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First off, open the antique trunk. After that, take the old key from the antique trunk inside the bedroom. Once you have picked up the old key, make it so that the wooden door is unlocked. After unlocking the wooden door, assure that the wooden door is opened. And then, make an attempt to go to the east. After that, look and see that the refrigerator is opened. After that, recover the lettuce from the refrigerator. If you can get your hands on the lettuce, put the lettuce on the stove. Got that? Good!

-= Bedroom =-
You arrive in a bedroom. A typical one.

You can make out a closed chest drawer. You scan the room for an antique trunk, and you find an antique trunk. You check the price tag that's still affixed to the antique trunk. Eighty bucks?! That's ridiculous! Do you know my good friend, they work for the government? I'm sure my friend could get you one of those for 45 bucks! You can see a king-size bed. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user has already opened the antique trunk and taken the old key. The next step according to the task was to unlock the wooden door. So I need to use the old key to unlock it. The door is closed, so the command should be to unlock it with the key. Then, after unlocking, they need to open the door. So first, unlock the door, then open it. But the user's next action should be to unlock the door with the key they just picked up. Let me check the previous steps again. The user is in the bedroom, has the key. The wooden door leading east is closed. So the next action is to unlock the door. The correct command would be "unlock wooden door" or "unlock door with old key". But in TextWorld, the commands are usually more direct. Since the key is in hand, the action would be to unlock the door. So the next step is to unlock the wooden door.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps correctly so far. They opened the antique trunk, took the old key, unlocked the wooden door, and opened it. Now they need to go east. The next step in the original task was to attempt to go to the east. So the next action should be "go east". But wait, the user's last action was opening the wooden door, and the current location might have changed. Let me check the previous steps again.

After opening the wooden door, the user would be outside the bedroom, leading to the next room. The next step is to go east from there. The user's next action should be "go east" to proceed. Then, after that, they need to look at the refrigerator, open it, get the lettuce, put it on the stove. But the current prompt is asking for the next action after confirming the steps so far. Since the user has successfully unlocked and opened the door, the next logical step is to move east. So the correct command here is "go east".

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a typical kind of place. That is to say, you're in a kitchen.

If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a refrigerator. You can make out a counter. The counter is standard. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. This always happens, here in TextWorld! What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. Look over there! a kitchen island. On the kitchen island you can see a note. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Kitchen scene now. The task was to open the refrigerator and get the lettuce from it. So far, they've unlocked and opened the wooden door, gone east to the kitchen, and now they need to handle the refrigerator.

The current state is that the refrigerator is closed. The next logical step would be to open it. The user's previous action was looking at the refrigerator, which didn't work because it's closed. So the correct action here is to try opening the refrigerator. The command should be "open refrigerator". That makes sense because the goal is to open it to get the lettuce. Let me make sure there's no other step needed. The user has to open the fridge first, then check inside. So the next command is definitely "open refrigerator".

GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

You open the refrigerator, revealing a lettuce and a tomato plant.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps correctly so far. They opened the antique trunk, took the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, went east to the kitchen, opened the refrigerator, took the lettuce. Now they need to put the lettuce on the stove.

The current location is the kitchen, and the next step is to place the lettuce on the stove. The user has the lettuce in their inventory since they just took it from the refrigerator. The stove is mentioned as being in the kitchen, so the action would be to go to the stove and put the lettuce there. But the command needs to be in the format specified, like "put lettuce on stove". Let me check the previous actions. The user took the lettuce, so they need to put it on the stove. The correct command here is "put lettuce on stove".
