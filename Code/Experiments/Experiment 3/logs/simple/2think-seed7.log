Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an fast paced round of TextWorld? You do! Here is your task for today. First of all, you could, like, make sure that the chest drawer is wide open. After opening the chest drawer, pick up the old key from the chest drawer. Having got the old key, make sure that the wooden door is unlocked with the old key. And then, open the wooden door. After that, travel east. That done, ensure that the refrigerator inside the kitchen is open. And then, recover the apple from the refrigerator. After taking the apple, rest the apple on the stove in the kitchen. Alright, thanks!

-= Bedroom =-
You arrive in a bedroom. An ordinary kind of place. You can barely contain your excitement.

Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a chest drawer. Now why would someone leave that there? If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's an antique trunk. You can see a king-size bed. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The king-size bed is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, let me see. The user has already opened the chest drawer, picked up the old key, and now they're asking if I'm on the right track and what the next action should be.

First, I need to recall the original task. The goal was to open the chest drawer, get the key, unlock the wooden door, open it, go east, open the fridge, get an apple, and put it on the stove. So far, the user has done the first two steps: opened the chest and picked up the key. The next step according to the plan is to use the old key to unlock the wooden door. 

Looking at the current location, the user is in the bedroom, and there's a closed wooden door leading east. The next logical step is to unlock that door with the key they just picked up. The user hasn't tried that yet, so the next command should be to unlock the door. 

Wait, but in the game's context, the action might be "unlock the wooden door" or "use the old key on the wooden door". But the previous actions were "open chest drawer" and "pick up old key". So the next step is to unlock the door with the key. The user's score is at 2/3, so they need to proceed to the next step. 

I should make sure that the command is correct. The wooden door is closed, and the key is in hand. So the next action is to unlock the door. The correct command would be "unlock wooden door" or "use old key on wooden door". But in the game's context, maybe "unlock wooden door" is the right command. Let me check the previous actions. The user was told to "make sure that the wooden door is unlocked with the old key". So the action here is to unlock it. 

Therefore, the next command should be "unlock wooden door".

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps given in the initial task. They started by opening the chest drawer, picking up the old key, unlocking the wooden door, and opening it. Now they're in the next part of the game.

The next step according to the original task was to travel east after opening the wooden door. Since the user just opened the door, the next logical step would be to move east. The current location is the bedroom, and after opening the door, they should go east to the next room, which is likely the kitchen based on the task description.

The user's score is at 4/5, so they need to complete the remaining steps: ensuring the refrigerator is open, recovering the apple, and putting it on the stove. Moving east would take them to the kitchen, where those actions can be performed. Therefore, the correct next action is to go east.

-= Kitchen =-
You've entered a kitchen.

Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a refrigerator. Now why would someone leave that there? You see a counter. The counter is typical. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a stove. The stove is standard. But there isn't a thing on it. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. Oh, great. Here's a kitchen island. The kitchen island is usual. On the kitchen island you can make out a note. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this!

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Okay, let me figure out the next step here. The user's goal was to recover the apple from the refrigerator. So far, they've opened the refrigerator and found both a bell pepper and an apple. The next logical step would be to pick up the apple. The user has to take the apple from the refrigerator. The previous action was opening the refrigerator, so the next command should be to take the apple. Let me check the available actions. The user is in the kitchen, and the refrigerator is open. The correct command would be "take apple" or "take the apple". Since the game might require specifying "the apple", but in previous steps, the user picked up the old key by just saying "pick up old key". Maybe here it's "take apple". But the exact phrasing might matter. Let me see the previous interactions. When they picked up the old key, they said "pick up old key". So maybe here it's "take apple". Alternatively, "get apple". But the correct command based on the game's context would be "take apple". So the next action is to take the apple from the refrigerator.

Okay, the user tried to "rest apple on stove" but the system said that's not a recognized verb. So I need to figure out the correct command. Let me think about the possible actions in the kitchen.

The user has the apple, and the goal is to rest the apple on the stove. The stove is in the kitchen. The correct command should be something like "put apple on stove" or "place apple on stove". Since "rest" isn't a valid verb here, the right action would be "put" or "place". 

Looking at the previous commands, the user used "take apple", which worked. So maybe "put apple on stove" is the correct command. Let me check if there's any other possible way. The stove is described as "standard" but not having anything on it. So the action should be to place the apple there. 

Therefore, the next action should be "put apple on stove".
