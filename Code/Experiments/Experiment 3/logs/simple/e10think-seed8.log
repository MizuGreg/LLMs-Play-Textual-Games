Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, doublecheck that the antique trunk in the bedroom is open. Then, pick up the old key from the antique trunk. Then, make it so that the wooden door within the bedroom is unlocked. Then, open the wooden door. After opening the wooden door, venture east. Then, open the screen door. Then, make an attempt to head east. That done, take a trip south. Then, pick up the milk from the floor of the garden. After getting the milk, try to head north. That done, attempt to take a trip west. Then, sit the milk on the stove in the kitchen. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Bedroom =-
You find yourself in a bedroom. An usual one. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You can see a chest drawer. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's an antique trunk. Were you looking for a king-size bed? Because look over there, it's a king-size bed. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.

You make out a closed refrigerator in the corner. You make out a counter. The counter is normal. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a stove. The stove is ordinary. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can see a kitchen island. Now why would someone leave that there? On the kitchen island you see a note. You shudder, but continue examining the room.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

You've just sauntered into a backyard.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a set of chairs. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Sometimes, just sometimes, TextWorld can just be the worst. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a bbq. But the thing is empty. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a patio table. But the thing is empty.

There is an open screen door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

<think>
Okay, let me figure out what to do next. The user has been following the steps given in the initial instructions. So far, they've opened the antique trunk, picked up the key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, ventured east into the kitchen, opened the screen door, and went east again into the backyard. Now, the next step according to the original plan was to take a trip south from the backyard.

Looking at the current location, which is the backyard, the available exits are west (screen door) and south (unguarded). The user needs to go south. The next step would be to use the 'go south' command. Let me check if there are any obstacles. The description mentions that the south entrance is unguarded, so it should be possible. The user's inventory has the old key, but since they're going south from the backyard, the key might not be needed here. So the correct action is to go south.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to take the milk from the floor in the garden, but the game says they can't see any such thing. Wait, looking back at the garden description, the user mentioned that there's a lettuce, a milk, a half of a bag of chips, and a shovel on the floor. So the milk is actually there. Maybe the problem is that the user is trying to take it from the floor, but the correct command is just "take milk" without specifying "from floor" since it's already on the floor. Let me check the previous attempts. The user tried "take milk from floor" multiple times, but the game keeps saying it can't see any such thing. But according to the room description, the milk is on the floor. So perhaps the correct command is just "take milk". The game might be interpreting "from floor" as an unnecessary part. So the next action should be "take milk" without the "from floor" part. That should work.

You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a lettuce, a half of a bag of chips and a shovel on the floor.

-= Backyard =-
You've just sauntered into a backyard.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a set of chairs. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Sometimes, just sometimes, TextWorld can just be the worst. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a bbq. But the thing is empty. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a patio table. But the thing is empty.

There is an open screen door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Backyard and Garden rooms. They keep going back and forth between them. The original goal was to pick up the milk from the garden, which they did, but now they're just moving around without progress.

Looking at the current situation: The user is in the Backyard, and the Garden is south. They tried going north and south multiple times, but it's not helping. The milk was picked up, but maybe the next step is to go to the kitchen again or another location.

Wait, the original plan after getting the milk was to try to head north, then take a trip west, then sit the milk on the stove in the kitchen. But the user hasn't reached the kitchen yet. Maybe they need to go back to the kitchen through the west door in the Backyard. The Backyard has an open screen door leading west, which might lead back to the Kitchen. So the next step should be to go west from the Backyard to get back to the Kitchen, then proceed to the stove.

But the user is currently in the Backyard, so the correct command would be "go west" to return to the Kitchen. Then, from the Kitchen, they can go north to the stove. But the user's last action was "go north" which led them back to the Backyard. So the next step is to go west instead of north.

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.

You make out a closed refrigerator in the corner. You make out a counter. The counter is normal. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a stove. The stove is ordinary. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can see a kitchen island. Now why would someone leave that there? On the kitchen island you see a note. You shudder, but continue examining the room.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.
