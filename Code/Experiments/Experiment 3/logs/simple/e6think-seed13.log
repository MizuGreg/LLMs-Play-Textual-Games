I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is how to play! First, it would be great if you could ensure that the chest drawer within the bedroom is open. And then, retrieve the old key from the chest drawer. And then, unlock the wooden door with the old key. And then, ensure that the wooden door within the bedroom is open. And then, make an attempt to go east. And then, open the screen door. After opening the screen door, make an effort to go to the east. Then, take a trip south. And then, retrieve the bell pepper from the floor of the garden. If you can get your hands on the bell pepper, head north. Then, travel west. After that, rest the bell pepper on the stove. Got that? Good!

-= Bedroom =-
You're now in the bedroom. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You can make out a chest drawer. You can see a closed antique trunk. You make out a king-size bed. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Hm. Oh well

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this TextWorld game and has followed a series of steps. They started in the bedroom, opened the chest drawer, retrieved the old key, unlocked the wooden door, and then opened it. Now they're at step 4/5.

The next step in the original instructions was to "make an attempt to go east." The user tried that, but maybe they got stuck or didn't proceed correctly. Then they had to open the screen door, go east again, take a trip south, retrieve the bell pepper, head north, travel west, and rest the bell pepper on the stove.

Wait, the current state after opening the wooden door (step 4/5) would be in the bedroom, with the door open. The next action should be to go east. But the user might have tried that already. Let me check the history.

Looking back, after opening the wooden door, the user's next action was to "make an attempt to go east." But the system message says to only output the action. However, the user might have tried "go east" and maybe failed, but in the current state, the wooden door is open. So the next step is to go east. But the user might need to open the screen door first. Wait, the original instructions said after opening the wooden door, make an attempt to go east. But maybe there's a screen door that needs to be opened first.

Wait, the original plan was: after opening the wooden door, go east. Then open the screen door, go east again. So maybe after opening the wooden door (step 4/5), the next action is to go east. But perhaps the user is in a room where going east leads to another door or a screen door. So the next command should be "go east". But the user might have tried that already. Alternatively, maybe the screen door is in the way. But according to the original plan, after opening the wooden door, they need to go east, then open the screen door, then go east again.

So the current step is after opening the wooden door (step 4/5), the next action is to "go east". The user's next command should be "go east".

You've just sauntered into a kitchen.

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a refrigerator. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a counter. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. You make out a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. The stove is ordinary. The stove appears to be empty. You can see a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

You can see a set of chairs. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a set of chairs, go to TextWorld. The set of chairs is usual. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You see a bbq. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You swear loudly. You can see a patio table. Now why would someone leave that there? But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to complete the game's objectives. So far, they've navigated through the bedroom, kitchen, and backyard, and are now in the garden. The goal was to retrieve the bell pepper from the floor of the garden, then head north, travel west, and rest the bell pepper on the stove.

The user tried taking the bell pepper from the floor, but the game said they can't see it. Wait, the garden description mentions a half of a bag of chips, an apple, a bell pepper, and a shovel on the floor. So the bell pepper is there. Maybe the user didn't use the correct command. The previous attempts were "take bell pepper from floor" but the game didn't recognize it. Maybe the correct command is just "take bell pepper" without specifying the floor, since the bell pepper is on the floor. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to first pick up the bell pepper, then go north, then west, then put it on the stove.

Wait, the user's last action was trying to take the bell pepper from the floor, but the game said they can't see it. Maybe the bell pepper is not visible, so they need to look for it. But according to the garden description, it's on the floor. Maybe the correct command is just "take bell pepper" without specifying the floor. Let me check the previous steps. The user was told to "retrieve the bell pepper from the floor of the garden." So the command should be "take bell pepper from floor". But the game said "You can't see any such thing." Maybe the bell pepper is not actually there, or the user needs to use a different command. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to first look around to find it. But in TextWorld, sometimes you have to use the correct syntax. Maybe the correct command is "take bell pepper" without the "from floor" part, since the game might automatically know it's on the floor. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to pick it up directly. Let me think. The user tried "take bell pepper from floor" twice, but it didn't work. Maybe the correct command is just "take bell pepper". Let me try that. If the user says "take bell pepper", the game might recognize it as the correct action. So the next step is to try that command.

Okay, let's recap. The user's goal is to retrieve the bell pepper from the garden, then head north, travel west, and rest the bell pepper on the stove. So far, they've done most of the steps: they picked up the bell pepper in the garden, went back to the backyard, and now they need to go west to the kitchen or another area where the stove is.

Looking at the current room (Backyard), the available exits are west (screen door) and south. The user needs to go west to reach the kitchen where the stove is. The previous steps showed that after going north from the garden, they ended up in the backyard again. So the next logical step is to go west through the screen door to reach the kitchen, then find the stove and put the bell pepper on it.

The user's last action was 'look', which didn't change the room. Now, they need to 'go west' to move towards the kitchen. Once there, they can interact with the stove. So the correct command here is 'go west' to proceed to the kitchen area.
