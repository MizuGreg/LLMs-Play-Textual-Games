I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is how to play! First, it would be great if you could ensure that the chest drawer within the bedroom is open. And then, retrieve the old key from the chest drawer. And then, unlock the wooden door with the old key. And then, ensure that the wooden door within the bedroom is open. And then, make an attempt to go east. And then, open the screen door. After opening the screen door, make an effort to go to the east. Then, take a trip south. And then, retrieve the bell pepper from the floor of the garden. If you can get your hands on the bell pepper, head north. Then, travel west. After that, rest the bell pepper on the stove. Got that? Good!

-= Bedroom =-
You're now in the bedroom. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You can make out a chest drawer. You can see a closed antique trunk. You make out a king-size bed. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Hm. Oh well

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. You make out a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. The stove is ordinary. The stove appears to be empty. You can see a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

You can see a set of chairs. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a set of chairs, go to TextWorld. The set of chairs is usual. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You see a bbq. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You swear loudly. You can see a patio table. Now why would someone leave that there? But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.

There is an open screen door leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a sequence of actions in TextWorld. They've already retrieved the old key, unlocked the door, opened the screen door, and moved to the garden. The next step was to retrieve the bell pepper from the floor. But when they tried "retrieve bell pepper from floor," the game didn't recognize it. Then they tried "take bell pepper from floor," but the game said they can't see any such thing.

Wait, maybe the correct verb is "take" instead of "retrieve"? Or maybe the object is just "bell pepper" without specifying "from floor." Let me check the game's possible commands. In TextWorld, typical verbs are "take," "put," "use," "open," "close," etc. So maybe the correct command is "take bell pepper." But the user tried "take bell pepper from floor" and it didn't work. However, the game might not require specifying the location if the object is already in the current room. Since the user is in the garden, and the bell pepper is on the floor, maybe just "take bell pepper" is sufficient. Let me think: when you're in the garden, the items are on the floor, so the command should be "take bell pepper." The previous attempt included "from floor," which might be redundant or incorrect. So the next action should be "take bell pepper."

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to complete a series of tasks in TextWorld. So far, they've managed to open the chest drawer, get the old key, unlock the door, open the wooden door, go east to the kitchen, open the screen door, go east again to the backyard, then go south to the garden where they retrieved the bell pepper. Now they need to rest the bell pepper on the stove.

But in the backyard, there's no stove mentioned. The user tried to put the bell pepper on the stove but couldn't see it. Wait, earlier in the kitchen, there was a stove. But they went from the garden back to the backyard. Maybe they need to go back to the kitchen where the stove is located. The user is currently in the backyard, so the next step would be to go back to the kitchen, then put the bell pepper on the stove there. But the user's last action was trying to put it in the backyard, which doesn't have a stove. So the correct action is to go north back to the kitchen, then put the bell pepper on the stove. But the user is in the backyard, so the immediate next step is to go north to the kitchen. Then, once there, put the bell pepper on the stove. But the user's current location is the backyard, so the next command should be to go north to the kitchen. Then, in the kitchen, they can put the bell pepper on the stove. But the user hasn't gone north yet. So the next action is to go north to the kitchen.
