It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First stop, open the chest drawer. And then, pick up the old key from the chest drawer within the bedroom. After picking up the old key, make it so that the wooden door is unlocked. After that, ensure that the wooden door within the bedroom is open. After that, move east. With that done, open the screen door. And then, go east. Following that, try to move south. Okay, and then, recover the apple from the floor of the garden. If you can get your hands on the apple, head north. That done, try to head west. And then, put the apple on the stove in the kitchen. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Bedroom =-
You find yourself in a bedroom. A typical kind of place. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You see a chest drawer. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can make out a closed antique trunk here. You see a king-size bed. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You swear loudly.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps in the TextWorld game. They started in the bedroom, opened the chest drawer, picked up the old key, unlocked the wooden door, and opened it. Now they're at the point where they need to move east.

The next step in the original instructions was to move east after opening the door. So the user should now "go east" to proceed. Since the previous actions have been successful and the score is increasing, it's likely that moving east is the correct next step. The user might be approaching the screen door mentioned earlier, which they need to open next. So the next action should be "go east".

-= Kitchen =-
You've just sauntered into a kitchen.

You make out a closed refrigerator. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. But there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the counter. You see a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a kitchen island! The kitchen island is normal. On the kitchen island you can see a note. Huh, weird.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

The patio table is usual. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

There is an open screen door leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps in the game, and they're currently in the Garden. The goal was to recover the apple from the floor of the garden, then head north, then west, and put the apple on the stove in the kitchen.

So, in the Garden, there's an apple on the floor. The user needs to pick it up. The next step after recovering the apple is to go north. Then west, and then put the apple on the stove. But first, they need to get the apple.

Looking at the current state: the user is in the Garden, and the apple is on the floor. The next action should be to pick up the apple. But the user's last action was "go south" which led them to the Garden. Now, they need to pick up the apple. The command would be "pick up apple" or "take apple". But the game's commands might be different. Wait, in the previous steps, the user picked up the old key using "pick up old key". So maybe the correct command here is "pick up apple".

After picking up the apple, the next step is to go north. Then west, then put the apple on the stove. So the immediate next action is to pick up the apple. The user's current location is the Garden, and the apple is there. So the correct command is "pick up apple".

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps in the game, trying to complete various tasks. They started in the bedroom, opened the chest drawer, picked up the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, then moved east to the kitchen, opened the screen door, went east again to the backyard, then south to the garden where they picked up the apple. They then went north back to the backyard, west to the kitchen, and then west again to the bedroom.

Now, they're in the bedroom again, and the next step according to the original plan was to put the apple on the stove in the kitchen. But the current location is the bedroom. The user has the apple, so they need to get back to the kitchen. The bedroom has an open wooden door leading east, which probably leads back to the kitchen. So the next action should be to go east from the bedroom to the kitchen, then proceed to the stove and place the apple there. But the user's last action was going west from the kitchen to the bedroom, so now they need to go east back to the kitchen. The correct command here would be "go east" to reach the kitchen again and then put the apple on the stove.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps in the TextWorld game. Their goal is to recover the apple from the garden, put it on the stove in the kitchen, and then win. So far, they've picked up the apple in the garden and went north to the backyard, then west to the kitchen, then north again to the bathroom, and back to the kitchen.

Now, they're at the kitchen again. The next step according to the original plan was to put the apple on the stove. But in the current scenario, they're in the kitchen, and the stove is mentioned as being there. The user has the apple in their inventory since they picked it up earlier. So the next logical step would be to go to the stove and place the apple there. However, the stove is closed, so maybe they need to open it first. Wait, but in the kitchen description, the stove is described as "you see a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though." So the stove is there, but maybe it's closed. The user needs to interact with it.

But the user's last action was going north to the bathroom, then back to the kitchen. Now, they need to go to the stove. The command would be "go to stove" or "go to stove". But in the game's context, the correct command might be "go to stove" or "go to the stove". However, the game might require using the exact phrase. Alternatively, since the stove is in the kitchen, and the user is already in the kitchen, maybe they need to use "open stove" if it's closed. But the original plan was to put the apple on the stove. So the correct action here is to go to the stove and then put the apple there. But the user is currently in the kitchen, so the next step is to go to the stove. The command would be "go to stove" or "go to the stove". However, in the previous steps, the user has been using commands like "go east" and "open screen door", so maybe the correct command here is "go to stove". But the game might require the exact wording. Alternatively, since the stove is in the kitchen, and the user is already there, maybe the next step is to "put apple on stove". But the user needs to be at the stove first. So the correct action is to go to the stove. Therefore, the next command should be "go to stove".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to complete a series of tasks in this text-based game. They've already picked up the apple in the garden and are now in the kitchen. The goal was to put the apple on the stove in the kitchen. But earlier, when they tried to do that, they were in the bathroom and couldn't see the stove. Now they're back in the kitchen.

Wait, the current location is the kitchen. The user has the apple. The stove is mentioned in the kitchen description. So maybe they need to go to the stove area. But the previous attempt to "put apple on stove" failed because they were in the bathroom. Now, in the kitchen, they should be able to interact with the stove.

But the user's last action was "go south" leading back to the kitchen. The next step is to try putting the apple on the stove. However, the game might require them to first go to the stove's location. Let me check the kitchen description again. The stove is mentioned as being in the kitchen, but the user might need to go to the stove's position. However, the game's current state says "You see a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though." So the stove is present but empty. The user has the apple, so they need to put it on the stove.

But the user tried "put apple on stove" earlier and got an error because they were in the bathroom. Now, in the kitchen, they should be able to do that. So the correct next action is to try putting the apple on the stove again. The game might have a mistake, but according to the current location, the stove is here. So the answer should be "put apple on stove".
