Welcome to another life changing episode of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, you could, like, doublecheck that the chest drawer is opened. Once you have opened the chest drawer, recover the old key from the chest drawer within the bedroom. And then, unlock the wooden door. Then, open the wooden door. Once you have opened the wooden door, attempt to go to the east. With that accomplished, make absolutely sure that the refrigerator within the kitchen is ajar. Then, pick up the milk from the refrigerator. After taking the milk, sit the milk on the stove. Got that? Good!

-= Bedroom =-
You've entered a bedroom. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

You make out a chest drawer. You see a closed antique trunk. You can see a king-size bed. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. This always happens, here in TextWorld!

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, let me figure out what to do next. The user has already opened the chest drawer and taken the old key. The next step was to unlock the wooden door. So, I need to use the key to unlock the door.

Wait, in the previous steps, the user was told to "unlock the wooden door" after getting the key. So the next action should be to unlock the door with the key. The command would be "unlock wooden door" or "use old key on wooden door". But in the game's context, maybe "unlock wooden door" is the correct verb here. Let me check the previous interactions. The user was told to "unlock the wooden door. Then, open the wooden door." So first unlock, then open. The user has the key now, so they need to unlock the door. The correct command would be "unlock wooden door". Then after that, open it. So the next step is to unlock the door with the key. The user has the key in their inventory now, so the action is to unlock the door. The response should be "unlock wooden door".

GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place. The room is well lit.

Oh, great. Here's a refrigerator. You make out a counter. The counter is ordinary. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. You see a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You can see a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island. Huh, weird.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

Okay, let's see. The user has successfully unlocked and opened the wooden door, then went east to the kitchen. The next step in the original task was to make sure the refrigerator in the kitchen is ajar. So, the user needs to check if the refrigerator is open. If it's closed, they might need to open it. But according to the current scene description, the refrigerator is mentioned as "closed" in the kitchen. Wait, the user's task says "make absolutely sure that the refrigerator within the kitchen is ajar." So the user needs to open it if it's closed. The current state says the refrigerator is closed, so the next action should be to open it. The command would be "open refrigerator". Let me check the previous steps again. The user has already done the steps up to going east to the kitchen. Now, the next step is to open the refrigerator. So the correct command is "open refrigerator".
