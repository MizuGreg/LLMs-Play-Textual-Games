I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First off, ensure that the antique trunk within the bedroom is open. After that, recover the old key from the antique trunk. After that, make it so that the wooden door in the bedroom is unlocked with the old key. And then, make absolutely sure that the wooden door inside the bedroom is ajar. After opening the wooden door, go east. Then, doublecheck that the screen door is wide open. And then, attempt to travel east. And then, try to travel south. With that done, lift the milk from the floor of the garden. After stealing the milk, head north. And then, attempt to travel west. With that done, rest the milk on the stove. That's it!

-= Bedroom =-
I am sorry to announce that you are now in the bedroom. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a chest drawer. You scan the room for an antique trunk, and you find an antique trunk. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to a king-size bed. The king-size bed is standard. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. You think about smashing the king-size bed to bits, throwing the bits in the dump, etc, until you get bored.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in the TextWorld game. They've already opened the antique trunk, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door, opened it, and moved east to the kitchen. Now they need to double-check that the screen door is wide open and then try to travel east again. 

The user tried "doublecheck screen door is wide open" but got an error because "doublecheck" isn't a recognized verb. The correct action here would be to "open" the screen door if it's closed. But the prompt says to "doublecheck that the screen door is wide open," so maybe the intended action is to verify its state. However, since the game might not recognize "doublecheck," the user might need to use "open" if it's closed or "check" if that's a valid verb.

Looking at the previous steps, the user had to "open" the wooden door. So maybe the correct action here is "open screen door" to ensure it's open. Alternatively, if the screen door is already open, the user might just need to "check" it, but the game might not accept that. The user's next action should be to open the screen door if it's closed. But the user's instruction says to "doublecheck," so perhaps the correct command is "open screen door" to confirm it's open. 

Wait, in the kitchen description, the screen door is listed as "closed," so the user needs to open it. The previous action was moving east into the kitchen, and the screen door is closed. So the next step is to open the screen door. Then, after that, try to travel east again. So the correct command here is "open screen door."

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to take the milk from the floor in the garden, but the game says they can't see any such thing. Wait, earlier when they were in the garden, the description mentioned "There is a milk, a half of a bag of chips, a lettuce and a shovel on the floor." So why can't they take the milk now?

Maybe the milk is not visible because the user hasn't looked properly. Or perhaps the command needs to be more specific. The user tried "take milk from floor" multiple times, but it's not working. Maybe the correct command is just "take milk" without specifying the floor, since the milk is on the floor. Alternatively, maybe the game requires the user to check the floor first or use a different verb.

Wait, in the garden description, the milk is on the floor, so the correct action should be "take milk" or "take milk from floor". But the game says "You can't see any such thing." That's confusing because the description explicitly states the milk is there. Maybe there's a typo or a mistake in the game's response. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use "pick up" instead of "take". But the game might only accept "take".

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to look around again. But the user has already been in the garden. Hmm. Since the game's response is inconsistent with the description, perhaps the correct action is to try "take milk" again, even though the game says it's not there. Or maybe the user needs to check the floor more carefully. But the user has already tried that. Maybe the game is broken, but the user has to proceed with the available commands. The next step after taking the milk is to head north and then rest the milk on the stove. So even if the milk isn't visible, the user might need to proceed with the next steps. But according to the game's feedback, the user can't take the milk. So maybe the correct command is "take milk" without specifying the floor, even though the game says it's not there. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use "look" to confirm the milk's presence. But the user hasn't done that. However, the user is supposed to only output the command, not additional text. So the next action should be "take milk" again, even though the game says it's not there. Or maybe the user needs to "pick up milk" instead. But the game might not recognize that. So the best possible command here is "take milk".

Okay, the user is trying to rest the milk on the stove in the kitchen. They've tried "rest milk on stove" but got an error. The game doesn't recognize "rest" as a verb here. So, what's the correct command?

In the game, previous actions involved verbs like "take", "open", "go", "unlock", etc. "Rest" isn't a standard verb in TextWorld. The user probably needs to use "put" instead. The correct command would be "put milk on stove".

Let me check the previous steps. The user was supposed to "rest the milk on the stove" after stealing it. Since "rest" isn't valid, "put" is the right verb here. So the next action should be "put milk on stove".
