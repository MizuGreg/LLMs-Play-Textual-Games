Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an fast paced round of TextWorld? You do! Here is your task for today. First of all, you could, like, make sure that the chest drawer is wide open. After opening the chest drawer, pick up the old key from the chest drawer. Having got the old key, make sure that the wooden door is unlocked with the old key. And then, open the wooden door. After that, travel east. That done, ensure that the refrigerator inside the kitchen is open. And then, recover the apple from the refrigerator. After taking the apple, rest the apple on the stove in the kitchen. Alright, thanks!

-= Bedroom =-
You arrive in a bedroom. An ordinary kind of place. You can barely contain your excitement.

Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a chest drawer. Now why would someone leave that there? If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's an antique trunk. You can see a king-size bed. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The king-size bed is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?

Okay, let me see. The user has been following the steps correctly so far. They opened the chest drawer, picked up the old key, unlocked the wooden door, and opened it. Now they're in the next room, which I assume is the kitchen since the next task is to ensure the refrigerator is open.

The next step mentioned in the original task was to go east after opening the wooden door. Wait, the user just opened the door, so maybe they're now in the kitchen. The next action should be to check the refrigerator. The instruction says to make sure the refrigerator is open. So the next command should be to open the refrigerator. Then, after that, recover the apple from it. But the user's last action was opening the door, so the next step is to go into the kitchen and open the refrigerator. But the user is already in the kitchen, so the next command is to open the refrigerator. Let me confirm the steps again.

Original task: After opening the wooden door, travel east. Then, ensure the refrigerator inside the kitchen is open. So after opening the door, they must be in the kitchen. So the next action is to open the refrigerator. The user is in the kitchen now, so the correct next command is "open refrigerator".

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this TextWorld game and has followed some steps. They started in the bedroom, opened the chest drawer, picked up the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door. Now they're in the next room, but the problem is that they need to find the refrigerator in the kitchen, which is part of the original goal.

Wait, after opening the wooden door, they should have moved into the next room. The user tried to open the refrigerator but couldn't because they weren't in the kitchen. So maybe the door leads to the kitchen. Let me check the previous steps again.

The initial task was: after opening the wooden door, travel east. Then ensure the refrigerator inside the kitchen is open and recover the apple. So after opening the wooden door, the next step is to go east. But the user might have already done that. Wait, the user's last action was opening the wooden door, and the next step should be to go east. But in the current state, they're in the bedroom, so maybe they need to move east to reach the kitchen.

Wait, the initial description said that there's a closed wooden door leading east. So when they opened the door, they should have moved into the next room, which is probably the kitchen. But the user tried to open the refrigerator and couldn't, which suggests they're still in the bedroom. That might mean that the door leads to the kitchen, but maybe the user hasn't moved into it yet. So the next step should be to go east to enter the kitchen. Then, once in the kitchen, they can open the refrigerator.

So the user's current location is the bedroom, and after opening the wooden door, they need to move east to the kitchen. Then, in the kitchen, they can open the refrigerator. The user tried to open the refrigerator directly, but since they're not in the kitchen, it's not possible. So the correct next step is to go east to the kitchen. Then, once there, open the refrigerator.

So the next action should be "go east" to move into the kitchen. Then, in the kitchen, they can open the refrigerator. That makes sense. The user might have made a mistake by trying to open the refrigerator without first moving to the kitchen. Therefore, the correct next command is "go east".

-= Kitchen =-
You've entered a kitchen.

Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a refrigerator. Now why would someone leave that there? You see a counter. The counter is typical. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a stove. The stove is standard. But there isn't a thing on it. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. Oh, great. Here's a kitchen island. The kitchen island is usual. On the kitchen island you can make out a note. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this!

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to rest the apple on the stove. The previous command "rest apple on stove" didn't work because the game didn't recognize "rest" as a valid verb. So, I need to figure out the correct action to take here.

In TextWorld games, actions are usually verbs that match the objects in the environment. The user has the apple, and they need to place it on the stove. The correct verb here might be "put" instead of "rest." Let me check the possible actions in the kitchen. The stove is mentioned as being standard, so putting the apple on it makes sense. 

The user tried "rest," which isn't a valid command. The correct action should be "put apple on stove." That should work because "put" is a common verb used for placing objects. Let me confirm that the stove is the right object. The kitchen has a stove, so that's the right place. 

So the next action should be "put apple on stove" to place the apple on the stove. That should complete the task of resting the apple there. I need to make sure there are no typos or incorrect verbs. Yes, "put" is the right verb here. Alright, that's the command to use.
