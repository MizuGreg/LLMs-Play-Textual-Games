You are now playing a exciting game of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First stop, assure that the chest drawer in the bedroom is wide open. And then, pick up the old key from the chest drawer inside the bedroom. Then, check that the wooden door is unlocked with the old key. After unlocking the wooden door, assure that the wooden door is wide open. After that, head east. Then, ensure that the screen door in the kitchen is open. Then, make an attempt to move east. With that accomplished, make an attempt to head south. Then, pick-up the lettuce from the floor of the garden. Then, travel north. Then, try to take a trip west. Then, rest the lettuce on the stove inside the kitchen. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Bedroom =-
You arrive in a bedroom. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You make out a chest drawer. What's that over there? It looks like it's an antique trunk. Were you looking for a king-size bed? Because look over there, it's a king-size bed. The king-size bed is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.

You see a closed refrigerator. What's that over there? It looks like it's a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is ordinary. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. What's the point of an empty counter? You can see a stove. The stove is usual. The stove appears to be empty. You see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is standard. On the kitchen island you make out a note. Hmmm... what else, what else?

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

-= Backyard =-
You're now in the backyard. You begin looking for stuff.

You make out a set of chairs. The set of chairs is ordinary. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? Oh, great. Here's a bbq. The bbq appears to be empty. Hm. Oh well Look over there! a patio table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the patio table.

There is an open screen door leading west. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what the next step should be. The user has been following the instructions step by step. So far, they've opened the chest drawer, picked up the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, went east to the kitchen, opened the screen door, went east again to the backyard, then went south to the garden where they picked up the lettuce. Then they went north back to the backyard.

The original task was to pick up the lettuce from the garden, then travel north, then try to take a trip west, then rest the lettuce on the stove in the kitchen. So after picking up the lettuce in the garden, the next steps according to the instructions are: travel north (which they did, back to the backyard), then try to go west. But in the current location (backyard), there's an open screen door leading west. So the next action should be to go west. That would take them back to the kitchen. Then, once in the kitchen, they can rest the lettuce on the stove.

But wait, the user is in the backyard now, after going north from the garden. The next step in the task is to "try to take a trip west" after picking up the lettuce. So from the garden, after going north to the backyard, they need to go west. The screen door in the backyard is open west, so "go west" should be the next command. Then, once in the kitchen, they can put the lettuce on the stove.

So the correct next action is to go west from the backyard. The user's last action was going north to the backyard, and now they need to go west. The system message says to only output the action, so the answer should be "go west".
</think>go west
