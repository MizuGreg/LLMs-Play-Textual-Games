Welcome to TextWorld! First off, ensure that the antique trunk within the bedroom is open. After pulling open the antique trunk, recover the old key from the antique trunk within the bedroom. Then, insert the old key into the wooden door's lock to unlock it. And then, ensure that the wooden door is open. And then, make an effort to head east. After that, doublecheck that the screen door is wide open. After that, go to the east. And then, make an attempt to take a trip south. Following that, lift the milk from the floor of the garden. If you have picked up the milk, venture north. And then, go west. And then, sit the milk on the stove. Got that? Good!

-= Bedroom =-
You find yourself in a bedroom. The room is well lit.

You can make out a chest drawer. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an antique trunk. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a king-size bed. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Hm. Oh well

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me figure out what the next step should be. The user has already opened the antique trunk and taken the old key. Then they tried to insert the key into the wooden door's lock. But the response was a bit confusing, maybe because the user didn't use the exact command format.

Wait, the previous action was "insert old key into wooden door's lock". The system response was a bit unclear, but the user is now asking if they're on the right track. The original goal was to unlock the door, so inserting the key into the lock is the next logical step. But maybe the correct command is "use old key on wooden door" or "unlock wooden door with old key". However, the user's previous command was "insert old key into wooden door's lock", which might not be the exact syntax expected by the game. 

Alternatively, maybe after inserting the key, the door should automatically unlock. But the user's last action was inserting the key, and the system didn't confirm it. So the next step would be to try to open the door. The user needs to make sure the door is unlocked. So the next action should be to open the wooden door. Let me check the original instructions again. The user was told to "insert the old key into the wooden door's lock to unlock it. And then, ensure that the wooden door is open." So after inserting the key, the door should be unlocked, then open it. But maybe the game requires the exact command. So after inserting the key, the next step is to open the door. So the next action should be "open wooden door".

Okay, let me figure out what the user needs here. They're playing a text-based game where they have to follow a series of steps to reach a goal. The current situation is that they've unlocked the wooden door, and the next step was to go east. But the game's response says they have to open the wooden door first, which is confusing because they just unlocked it.

Wait, maybe there's a misunderstanding. The user tried to go east before the door was fully open. The game might be requiring them to ensure the door is open before proceeding. So even though they unlocked it, they need to open it completely. The previous action was unlocking, but maybe "open" is different from "unlock" in the game's context. So the next step should be to open the door again to make sure it's fully open, then go east. The user's next action should be to open the wooden door again, then go east. But the user's last command was "go east", which the game rejected. So the correct sequence is: unlock the door, then open it, then go east. The user might have missed the "open" step after unlocking. So the next action should be to open the door again.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this TextWorld game, and they've been following a set of instructions to progress through the rooms. So far, they've opened the antique trunk, taken the key, unlocked the wooden door, went east into the kitchen, then south into the living room. The current location is the Living Room, and the next step according to the original instructions was to "make an effort to head east" after checking the screen door. But in the current state, they're in the Living Room, and the possible directions are north or maybe other doors.

Wait, the user's last action was "go south" from the kitchen to the living room. Now, in the living room, the description mentions a couch, a lettuce, a low table with a remote, a TV, and the option to go north. The original plan after the kitchen was to check the screen door (which was open), go east, then try to go south again. But in the current room, the user is in the Living Room. The next step in the original instructions was after going east from the kitchen, then going south. But maybe the user needs to check if the screen door is open again, but in the kitchen, the screen door was already open. Wait, the original steps said: after unlocking the door and going east (into kitchen), then check screen door is open, then go east again, then try to go south. But in the current state, the user is in the Living Room, which is south of the kitchen. So perhaps the next step is to go north back to the kitchen, but the original instructions said after the kitchen, go south. Hmm, maybe I need to retrace the steps.

Wait, the original instructions said: after unlocking the door and going east (into kitchen), then check screen door is open, then go east again (maybe to another room?), then try to go south. But in the current scenario, the user is in the Living Room, which is south of the kitchen. So maybe the next step is to go north back to the kitchen, but the original plan was to go south from the kitchen. Wait, maybe there's confusion here. Let me check the original steps again.

Original steps: After unlocking the door and going east (into kitchen), then check screen door is open, then go east again (maybe to a garden?), then go south. But in the current state, the user is in the Living Room, which is south of the kitchen. So perhaps the next step is to go north back to the kitchen, but the original instructions said after the kitchen, go south. Maybe the user is supposed to go south from the kitchen to the living room, then from there, go north again? Or perhaps there's a different path. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east from the living room, but the description says the living room has a north exit. Wait, the living room's description says "You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked." So the user can go north from the living room back to the kitchen. But according to the original plan, after the kitchen, the user was supposed to go south. But maybe the user is now in the living room, and the next step is to go north back to the kitchen, then proceed as per the original plan. However, the original instructions said after the kitchen, go south. But the user is in the living room, which is south of the kitchen. So maybe the user needs to go north back to the kitchen, then go south again? That seems redundant. Alternatively, perhaps the user is supposed to go east from the living room, but the living room's description doesn't mention an east door. The living room's description says there's a north exit. So maybe the next step is to go north back to the kitchen, then proceed as per the original plan. But the user's current location is the living room, and the next action should be to go north. However, the original instructions said after the kitchen, go south. But the user is in the living room, which is south of the kitchen. So maybe the user is supposed to go north back to the kitchen, then go south again? That seems like a loop. Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go east from the living room, but there's no east door. The living room's description doesn't mention an east door. The only doors mentioned are north and possibly others. Wait, the living room's description says "You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked." So the only door mentioned is north. Therefore, the next step is to go north back to the kitchen. But according to the original plan, after the kitchen, the user was supposed to go south. But the user is now in the living room, so perhaps the next step is to go north back to the kitchen, then proceed as per the original plan. However, the user's score is at 5/9, and the original plan had steps after the kitchen. Maybe the user is supposed to go east from the kitchen, but the kitchen's description mentions a screen door leading east and an open wooden door leading west. So after the kitchen, the user was supposed to check the screen door (which is open), then go east. But in the current state, the user is in the living room, which is south of the kitchen. Therefore, the user needs to go north back to the kitchen, then go east. But the user's last action was going south from the kitchen to the living room. So the next step is to go north back to the kitchen, then proceed as per the original plan. However, the user's current location is the living room, so the next action is to go north. But the user's previous action was going south, so going north would return to the kitchen. Then, from the kitchen, the user would check the screen door (which is open), then go east. But the user is now in the living room, so the next action is to go north. However, the user's instructions said after the kitchen, go south. But the user is in the living room, so maybe the next step is to go north back to the kitchen, then proceed. Therefore, the correct next action is to go north.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a text adventure game. Their goal is to follow a series of steps to reach the original goal, which I assume is escaping or completing the game. So far, they've opened the antique trunk, taken the key, unlocked the door, and moved east to the kitchen. Then they went south to the living room and back north again.

The current location is the kitchen again. The user has a score of 5 out of 12. The original instructions mentioned lifting the milk from the garden, then going north, west, and putting it on the stove. But in the current scenario, the user is in the kitchen, which is a loop between kitchen, living room, and back to kitchen.

Wait, the user hasn't found the milk yet. The next step in the original plan was after unlocking the door and going east, then checking the screen door, going east again, then trying to go south. Then lift the milk from the garden, go north, west, and put it on the stove.

But in the current state, the user is in the kitchen, and the kitchen has a note, but no milk. The garden isn't mentioned here. Maybe the milk is in the garden, which is east of the kitchen? The user has a screen door leading east in the kitchen. So maybe they need to go east through the screen door to the garden, find the milk, then return.

But the user's last action was going north from the living room back to the kitchen. So the next step would be to check the screen door east in the kitchen. The original plan said after going east, check the screen door, then go east again. So maybe the user needs to go east through the screen door to the garden, find the milk, then return.

But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action should be to go east through the screen door. The current location is the kitchen, and the screen door is closed. Wait, in the kitchen description, the screen door is closed. So the user needs to open it first. But the original plan said to double-check the screen door is open. Wait, the original steps said: after going east, double-check screen door is open, then go east again. But in the current state, the screen door is closed. So the user needs to open it first.

Wait, the user is in the kitchen, and the screen door is closed. So the next action should be to open the screen door. Then go east to the garden. Then lift the milk. Then go north, west, and put it on the stove. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next step is to open the screen door.

Okay, the user tried to "lift milk from floor of garden" but the game didn't recognize it. Let me check the current location. They're in the Backyard. The previous steps involved opening the screen door and going east to the backyard. The task was to lift the milk from the garden's floor.

Wait, in the Backyard description, there's a patio table and chairs, but no mention of milk. The user might have confused the garden with the backyard. Maybe the milk is in the garden area, which is separate from the backyard. Alternatively, perhaps the correct action is to "take milk from floor" or "pick up milk". Since "lift" isn't a valid verb here, the correct command might be "take milk" or "pick up milk from floor". The user needs to use the correct verb that the game accepts. Let me check the possible commands. The game might expect "take milk" or "pick up milk". Since the user was instructed to "lift the milk from the floor of the garden", maybe the correct command is "take milk from floor" or "pick up milk". The previous action was in the backyard, so maybe the milk is there. But the description didn't mention milk. Wait, maybe the garden is a different location. The user might need to go to the garden first. But the current location is the backyard. Maybe the correct action is "take milk" without specifying the location, but the game might require "from floor of garden". Alternatively, the user might have made a mistake in the location. But the user is in the backyard. Hmm. The correct command should be "take milk" or "pick up milk". Since "lift" wasn't accepted, the user should try "take milk" or "pick up milk from floor of garden". The game might accept "take milk" even if the location isn't specified. Let me go with "take milk" as the next action.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the instructions in the game. The original goal was to lift the milk from the floor of the garden. But in the current Backyard scene, there's no mention of milk. The user tried "lift milk from floor of garden" which didn't work. Then they tried "look around" and "look under patio table", but found nothing.

So, maybe the milk is somewhere else. The user needs to check other areas. The Backyard has a screen door leading west, which was previously opened. Maybe the milk is in another room. The previous rooms included the Kitchen, Living Room, Bedroom, etc. Wait, the user was in the Backyard after going east from the Kitchen. The exit to the south is unguarded. Maybe the milk is in the Garden, but the user is in the Backyard. Alternatively, maybe the milk was picked up earlier but not yet carried. Wait, the original steps said: after picking up the milk, venture north, then go west, then sit the milk on the stove. But the user hasn't picked up the milk yet. So maybe the milk is in the Garden, but the user hasn't found it. The user is in the Backyard now. The patio table is empty. Maybe the milk is on the floor, but the user didn't see it. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check the Kitchen again. But the user is in the Backyard. The next step would be to check the Garden, but how? The Backyard has an exit to the south. Maybe the user should go south to the Garden. But the user is already in the Backyard. Wait, the Backyard's description says "floor of the garden" but maybe the Garden is a separate area. The user needs to go south from the Backyard to reach the Garden. So the next action should be to go south. That makes sense. So the correct command is "go south".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the instructions in the TextWorld game. They've already opened the antique trunk, taken the key, unlocked the door, and gone east to the kitchen. Then they went south to the living room, north back to the kitchen, opened the screen door, went east to the backyard. Now they're in the garden, where there's a milk on the floor.

The next step according to the original plan was to "lift the milk from the floor of the garden." But when they tried "lift milk from floor of garden," the game said that's not a recognized verb. Then they tried "take milk from floor," which also didn't work. The user then tried "look around" and "look under patio table," but those didn't find the milk.

Wait, in the Garden room description, it says: "There is a half of a bag of chips, a milk, a bell pepper and a shovel on the floor." So the milk is there. The problem is that the user is using the wrong command. The correct command should be "take milk" or "get milk" instead of "lift" or "take milk from floor." Since the game doesn't recognize "lift," maybe "take" is the right verb here. But when they tried "take milk from floor," it didn't work. Maybe the correct command is just "take milk" without specifying the floor, since the milk is on the floor. Alternatively, maybe the game expects "pick up milk" or "pick milk up."

But the user's last action was "look around," which didn't find anything. Then they tried "look under patio table," but the patio table is in the backyard, not the garden. Wait, the current location is the garden. The patio table was in the backyard. So maybe the user is confused between the backyard and the garden. But the game says in the garden there's a milk on the floor. So the correct action is to take the milk. The previous attempts to take it from the floor might have been incorrect because the game might not require specifying the floor if it's the only place the milk is. So the next step should be "take milk" or "get milk."

-= Backyard =-
You find yourself in a backyard. A normal kind of place. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a set of chairs. There's something about an object in a room that's just so... TextWorld. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a set of chairs in a room. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a bbq. The bbq is normal. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You make out a patio table. The patio table is ordinary. The patio table appears to be empty.

There is an open screen door leading west. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

You have walked into the most ordinary of all possible kitchens. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You see a refrigerator. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You can make out a counter. The counter appears to be empty. Look over there! a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a kitchen island. The kitchen island is ordinary. On the kitchen island you can see a note. Classic TextWorld.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in this text adventure game. They started in the bedroom, opened the trunk, took the key, unlocked the door, and moved east to the kitchen. Then they went south to the living room, north back to the kitchen, opened the screen door, went east to the backyard, and finally found the milk in the garden. Now they've picked up the milk and gone back to the kitchen.

The next step according to the original instructions was to "sit the milk on the stove." But in the current scenario, the user is in the kitchen again. The stove is mentioned as being empty. So the logical next action would be to place the milk on the stove. However, the user has to use the correct command. Since they have the milk in hand, the command should be "put milk on stove." But I need to check if that's the correct verb here. Alternatively, maybe "put milk on stove" is the right command. The previous action was "go west," leading back to the kitchen. Now, the next step is to put the milk on the stove. So the answer should be "put milk on stove."
