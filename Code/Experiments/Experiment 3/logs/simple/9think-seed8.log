Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, doublecheck that the antique trunk in the bedroom is open. Then, pick up the old key from the antique trunk. Then, make it so that the wooden door within the bedroom is unlocked. Then, open the wooden door. After opening the wooden door, venture east. Then, open the screen door. Then, make an attempt to head east. That done, take a trip south. Then, pick up the milk from the floor of the garden. After getting the milk, try to head north. That done, attempt to take a trip west. Then, sit the milk on the stove in the kitchen. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Bedroom =-
You find yourself in a bedroom. An usual one. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You can see a chest drawer. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's an antique trunk. Were you looking for a king-size bed? Because look over there, it's a king-size bed. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.

You make out a closed refrigerator in the corner. You make out a counter. The counter is normal. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a stove. The stove is ordinary. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can see a kitchen island. Now why would someone leave that there? On the kitchen island you see a note. You shudder, but continue examining the room.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in the TextWorld game. They've already opened the antique trunk, picked up the key, unlocked and opened the wooden door leading east, which took them to the kitchen. Then they tried to go east again but couldn't because the screen door was closed. They opened the screen door, and now they're in the kitchen.

The next step in their original plan was to "attempt to head east" after opening the screen door. So, after opening the screen door, they should try to go east again. The available commands include 'go east', which they tried earlier but maybe got a message about needing to open the screen door first. But since they've already opened it, they can proceed.

Looking at the current room description, there's a closed screen door leading east, but they just opened it. So the next logical step is to go east again. The user's last action was opening the screen door, so the next command should be 'go east' to move into the next room. The response should be straightforward, just the command without any extra text.

-= Backyard =-
You've just sauntered into a backyard.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a set of chairs. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Sometimes, just sometimes, TextWorld can just be the worst. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a bbq. But the thing is empty. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a patio table. But the thing is empty.

There is an open screen door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a loop between the Garden and Backyard, going back and forth. The original goal was to pick up the milk and then take a trip west after getting it. But the user has already picked up the milk in the Garden and went north to Backyard, then south again. Now they're stuck in a cycle.

Wait, the user's last action was going south from Backyard to Garden again. The goal was to take the milk and then go west. But in the Garden, after picking up the milk, the next step was to try to head west. However, the user is currently in the Garden, having picked up the milk. The next step should be to go west from the Garden. But the Garden's description says there's a lettuce, half a bag of chips, and a shovel on the floor. The user hasn't tried to go west from the Garden yet. 

Looking at the previous steps, after picking up the milk, the user went north to Backyard, then south back to Garden. Now, the user needs to go west from the Garden. But the Garden's description doesn't mention a west direction. Wait, the Garden's description says "You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded." So maybe the Garden has a west exit? Or perhaps the user needs to go west from the Backyard. 

Wait, in the Backyard, there's an open screen door leading west. But the user is in the Garden now. The Garden's description doesn't mention a west door. So maybe the user needs to go north from the Garden to Backyard again, then west through the screen door. But the user is stuck in a loop. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west from the Garden. But according to the current room description, the Garden doesn't have a west exit. The user might have to go north to Backyard, then west through the screen door. But the user has already done that before. 

Wait, the original plan was: after getting the milk, try to head north, then attempt to take a trip west. But the user is in the Garden, having picked up the milk. The next step should be to go north to Backyard, then west. But the user is going back and forth between Garden and Backyard. 

So the correct next step is to go west from the Backyard. But the user is in the Garden. So the user needs to go north to Backyard, then west. But the user is currently in the Garden, so the next command should be 'go north' to reach Backyard again, then 'go west' through the screen door. However, the user's last action was 'go south' to return to Garden. So the next step is to 'go north' again to Backyard, then 'go west'. But the user is in the Garden, so the next command is 'go north' to Backyard. Then, from Backyard, 'go west' through the screen door. 

But the user's last action was 'go south' to Garden, so the next command should be 'go north' to get back to Backyard. Then, from Backyard, 'go west' to proceed. However, the user's current location is Garden, so the next action is 'go north' to Backyard. Then, from Backyard, 'go west' through the screen door. 

But the user is in the Garden, so the next step is 'go north' to Backyard. Then, from Backyard, 'go west' to continue. However, the user might have already done that. But according to the current state, the user is in the Garden again. So the correct next action is 'go north' to Backyard, then 'go west'. But the user needs to proceed to the next step. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go west from the Garden. But the Garden's description doesn't mention a west exit. So the user must go north to Backyard, then west. Therefore, the next command is 'go north' to reach Backyard again, then 'go west'. But the user is in the Garden, so the next action is 'go north'.

There is an open screen door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

You find yourself in a garden. A typical kind of place. You begin looking for stuff.

There is a lettuce, a half of a bag of chips and a shovel on the floor.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Garden and Backyard areas. They've been going back and forth between north and south, but they haven't made progress towards the original goal. The goal was to pick up the milk and then take it to the stove in the kitchen. But the user hasn't reached the kitchen yet.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Garden, which has the milk on the floor. They picked up the milk earlier, but then they started wandering around again. The problem is that after picking up the milk, they need to go back to the kitchen to put it on the stove. However, the path back to the kitchen seems to be blocked by the screen door in the Backyard, which they need to open again. But the user hasn't tried going west from the Backyard to get back to the kitchen.

Wait, in the Backyard, there's an open screen door leading west. So maybe the user needs to go west from the Backyard to return to the kitchen. But the user has been going south and north repeatedly, not trying to go west. So the next step should be to go west from the Backyard to get back to the kitchen, then put the milk on the stove. But the user hasn't done that yet. They need to go west from the Backyard to reach the kitchen again. So the correct command here is "go west" to return to the kitchen and then put the milk on the stove.

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.

You make out a closed refrigerator in the corner. You make out a counter. The counter is normal. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a stove. The stove is ordinary. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can see a kitchen island. Now why would someone leave that there? On the kitchen island you see a note. You shudder, but continue examining the room.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.
