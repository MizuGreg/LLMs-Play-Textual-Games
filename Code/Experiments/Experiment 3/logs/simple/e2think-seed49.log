I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, you could, like, ensure that the antique trunk in the bedroom is open. Then, take the old key from the antique trunk inside the bedroom. After taking the old key, unlock the wooden door in the bedroom. And then, assure that the wooden door is wide open. After that, move east. Okay, and then, doublecheck that the screen door in the kitchen is opened. After that, travel east. That done, make an attempt to move south. After that, recover the tomato plant from the floor of the garden. Then, make an attempt to take a trip north. With that over with, go to the west. After that, sit the tomato plant on the stove inside the kitchen. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Bedroom =-
You've just walked into a bedroom.

You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to a chest drawer. What's that over there? It looks like it's an antique trunk. You can see a king-size bed. The king-size bed is usual. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps given in the task. So far, they've opened the antique trunk, taken the old key, and then they need to unlock the wooden door in the bedroom. The next step after taking the key is to unlock the door. The user mentioned that after taking the key, they should unlock the wooden door and then make sure it's wide open. So the next action should be to unlock the door with the key they just took. The command would be "unlock wooden door". Let me check the previous steps again to make sure. Yes, the current state is after taking the key, so the next logical step is to unlock the door. Then, after unlocking, they need to open it fully. But the immediate next action is to unlock it. So the correct command here is "unlock wooden door".

-= Kitchen =-
I never took you for the sort of person who would show up in a kitchen, but I guess I was wrong.

You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a refrigerator. Hmmm... what else, what else? Oh, great. Here's a counter. The counter is usual. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You can see a stove. The stove is ordinary. But the thing is empty. You see a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the garden and tried to take the tomato plant from the floor. The game responded that they can't see any such thing. Wait, but the description mentioned a tomato plant on the floor. Maybe the command needs to be more specific. The correct command should be "take tomato plant from floor" but maybe the game expects "take tomato plant" without specifying the floor? Or perhaps the plant is not visible, so they need to examine it first? Wait, the user's previous action was "take tomato plant from floor", but the game said it can't see it. Maybe the tomato plant is actually on the stove in the kitchen, but the user is in the garden now. Wait, no, the task said to recover the tomato plant from the floor of the garden. So maybe the user needs to check again. Alternatively, maybe the command should be "take tomato plant" without specifying the floor. Let me check the available commands. The user can use "take ... from ...", so perhaps the correct command is "take tomato plant from floor". But the game said it can't see it. Maybe the tomato plant is not there? Wait, the room description says: "There is a bell pepper, a tomato plant, a milk and a shovel on the floor." So the tomato plant is indeed there. Maybe the user needs to use "take tomato plant" without the "from floor" part? Or maybe the game requires the exact phrasing. Let me think. The user tried "take tomato plant from floor" and it failed. Maybe the correct command is just "take tomato plant". Let me try that. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to examine the tomato plant first. But the task says to take it from the floor. Hmm. Maybe the game is expecting "take tomato plant" without the "from floor" part. Let me try that.
