Welcome to another life changing episode of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, you could, like, doublecheck that the chest drawer is opened. Once you have opened the chest drawer, recover the old key from the chest drawer within the bedroom. And then, unlock the wooden door. Then, open the wooden door. Once you have opened the wooden door, attempt to go to the east. With that accomplished, make absolutely sure that the refrigerator within the kitchen is ajar. Then, pick up the milk from the refrigerator. After taking the milk, sit the milk on the stove. Got that? Good!

-= Bedroom =-
You've entered a bedroom. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

You make out a chest drawer. You see a closed antique trunk. You can see a king-size bed. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. This always happens, here in TextWorld!

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place. The room is well lit.

Oh, great. Here's a refrigerator. You make out a counter. The counter is ordinary. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. You see a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You can see a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island. Huh, weird.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in the kitchen after opening the refrigerator. They found milk and lettuce inside. The next step according to the original task was to pick up the milk from the refrigerator. But the user just opened the refrigerator, so maybe they need to take the milk now.

Wait, the previous action was opening the refrigerator, which revealed the milk. So the next logical step is to pick up the milk. But the user's last input was "make sure refrigerator is ajar", which wasn't a valid command. Then the assistant suggested "open refrigerator", which worked. Now, the user is at the kitchen, and the refrigerator is open. The next step is to take the milk from the refrigerator. But the correct command would be "take milk from refrigerator" or "pick up milk". However, in TextWorld, the exact phrasing matters. The original task said "pick up the milk from the refrigerator", so the correct command is "take milk from refrigerator" or "pick up milk". But the user might have to use "take" as the verb. Let me check the previous interactions. Earlier, the user was told to "recover the old key from the chest drawer", and the correct command was "take old key from chest drawer". So following that pattern, the correct command here would be "take milk from refrigerator". But the user might have to use "pick up" instead. However, in TextWorld, the verbs are usually "take" or "get". So the correct command is "take milk from refrigerator". But the user's last action was opening the refrigerator, so now they need to take the milk. The next step is to take the milk. So the answer should be "take milk from refrigerator".
