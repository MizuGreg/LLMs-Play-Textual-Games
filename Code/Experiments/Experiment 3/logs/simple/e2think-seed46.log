Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First, it would be great if you could make sure that the antique trunk is opened. After that, pick up the old key from the antique trunk inside the bedroom. After picking up the old key, assure that the wooden door in the bedroom is unlocked. After unlocking the wooden door, doublecheck that the wooden door is wide open. Then, try to go to the east. With that accomplished, ensure that the refrigerator within the kitchen is open. And then, retrieve the milk from the refrigerator inside the kitchen. And then, rest the milk on the stove. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Bedroom =-
You are in a bedroom. A normal kind of place.

What's that over there? It looks like it's a chest drawer. You can see a closed antique trunk. You scan the room for a king-size bed, and you find a king-size bed. The king-size bed is standard. But the thing is empty.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me see. The user has already opened the antique trunk and picked up the old key. The next step according to the instructions was to unlock the wooden door in the bedroom. So after picking up the key, the next logical step is to use the key to unlock the door. The user mentioned that after unlocking, they need to check if the door is wide open and then go east. So the next action should be to unlock the door with the key. The current location is the bedroom, and the door is leading east. So the command should be to unlock the wooden door. Let me make sure that's the correct next step. Yes, that's right. The user has the key, so they can unlock the door now.

Okay, the user is in the bedroom, has the old key, just unlocked the wooden door, and now needs to check if the door is wide open. The next step after unlocking is to ensure it's fully open. But the user might not know the exact command for that. The original goal was to go east after the door is open. So after checking the door is open, the next action is to go east. But the user's last action was checking the door, and the system responded with a message. Now the user is asking if they're on the right track and needs the next command. Since the door is unlocked, the next step is to open it fully and then go east. But the correct command here is probably "open wooden door" or "push wooden door". However, the game might require a specific command. Alternatively, after unlocking, the door might automatically open, so the next step is to go east. But the user needs to confirm the door is open. The previous step was checking if it's wide open, but the system didn't respond. So maybe the next action is to go east. But the user needs to make sure the door is open. The correct next command would be "go east" once the door is open. But since the user just unlocked it, maybe the door is now open, so they can proceed.

You have to open the wooden door first.

Okay, the user has opened the wooden door leading east. Now they need to move to the east side. The next step in the original instructions was to go to the east. So after opening the door, the next action should be to go east. The user is in the bedroom, and the door is now open. So the command is "go east". That makes sense. Let me make sure there's no other step in between. The original goal after going east is to ensure the refrigerator in the kitchen is open and retrieve the milk. So after going east, they'll enter the kitchen. But the current step is to go east. So the next command is "go east".

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. A typical kind of place.

What's that over there? It looks like it's a refrigerator. You see a counter. The counter is typical. But the thing is empty. Sometimes, just sometimes, TextWorld can just be the worst. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You see a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island. Now that's what I call TextWorld!

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an unguarded exit to the north. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

Okay, the user tried to "rest milk on stove" but the game didn't recognize it. So I need to find the correct command for putting the milk on the stove. Maybe the correct verb is "put" instead of "rest". Let me check the possible actions. The user has the milk in hand, so the next step is to place it on the stove. The correct command would be "put milk on stove". That makes sense. Let me make sure that's the right phrasing. Yes, "put" is the standard verb for placing items. So the next action should be "put milk on stove".
