Welcome to TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, you could, like, open the chest drawer. Then, pick up the old key from the chest drawer. After picking up the old key, assure that the wooden door is unlocked. Then, ensure that the wooden door is open. After pulling open the wooden door, take a trip east. And then, make sure that the screen door is wide open. After that, make an effort to move east. With that done, attempt to take a trip south. Then, pick-up the bell pepper from the floor of the garden. And then, attempt to go to the north. If you can succeed at that, make an effort to take a trip west. And then, rest the bell pepper on the stove. Got that? Good!

-= Bedroom =-
You are in a bedroom. A standard kind of place.

You can make out a chest drawer. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You see a closed antique trunk close by. Look over there! a king-size bed. The king-size bed appears to be empty.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps given in the initial task. They started by opening the chest drawer, picking up the old key, unlocking the wooden door, and then opening it. Now they're at the fifth step, which was to move east after opening the door.

The current location is the bedroom, and the wooden door leading east is now open. The next step mentioned in the task was to "make sure that the screen door is wide open." Wait, the user hasn't encountered a screen door yet. Maybe after moving east, they'll find it. But the user's last action was opening the wooden door, so the next logical step is to move east. 

But the user's next action should be moving east. However, the user's previous action was opening the wooden door, which is east. So maybe after opening the door, they need to go through it. The instruction says "after pulling open the wooden door, take a trip east." So perhaps the next step is to move east. 

But the user is in the bedroom, and the wooden door is open. So the next command should be "go east" or "move east." The user's previous action was "open the wooden door," so the next step is to go through it. The game's current state shows the bedroom with the open door. So the correct next action is to go east. 

The user's next action should be "go east." That's the next step in the task. The user has completed up to step 4 (opening the door), and the next step is moving east. So the answer is "go east."

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. A standard one.

You see a refrigerator. You check the price tag that's still affixed to the refrigerator. 100 bucks? What a deal! You'll have to ask where they got this! You see a counter. The counter is typical. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. Look over there! a kitchen island. You wonder idly who left that here. The kitchen island is usual. On the kitchen island you see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Backyard =-
You've entered a backyard. You can barely contain your excitement.

You scan the room for a set of chairs, and you find a set of chairs! The set of chairs is typical. But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? What's that over there? It looks like it's a bbq. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a bbq, go to TextWorld. However, the bbq, like an empty bbq, has nothing on it. You can see a patio table. The patio table is normal. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

There is an open screen door leading west. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

I am so happy to announce that you are now in the garden. You begin to take stock of what's here.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked.

There is a half of a bag of chips, a bell pepper, an apple and a shovel on the floor.

Okay, let's see. The user has been progressing through the game according to the initial plan. They've opened the chest drawer, picked up the key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, moved east to the kitchen, opened the screen door, went east again to the backyard, and then south to the garden. Now, in the garden, they need to pick up the bell pepper from the floor as per the task.

The current location is the garden, and the items on the floor include a half-bag of chips, a bell pepper, an apple, and a shovel. The next step in the original goal was to "pick-up the bell pepper from the floor of the garden." So the user needs to pick up the bell pepper here. The command should be "pick up bell pepper." After that, they need to attempt to go north, then west, and rest the bell pepper on the stove. But the next immediate action is picking up the bell pepper. So the correct command here is to pick it up.

Okay, let's recap the user's progress. They started in the bedroom, opened the chest drawer, picked up the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door east. Then they went through the door to the kitchen, opened the screen door, went east to the backyard, then south to the garden where they picked up the bell pepper. Then they went north back to the backyard, west to the kitchen, and then west again back to the bedroom.

The original goal was to eventually rest the bell pepper on the stove. The user has the bell pepper in their inventory now. The next step would be to go back to the kitchen where the stove is. From the bedroom, the open wooden door leads east back to the kitchen. So the next action should be to go east again. But wait, the user is in the bedroom now. The current location is the bedroom, and the open door is east. So the correct command is "go east" to return to the kitchen, then proceed to the stove. But the user's last action was "go west" from the kitchen to the bedroom. Now, in the bedroom, the next step is to go east back to the kitchen. Then, once in the kitchen, they can go to the stove and rest the bell pepper there. So the next command should be "go east" from the bedroom.
