Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an fast paced round of TextWorld? You do! Here is your task for today. First of all, you could, like, make sure that the chest drawer is wide open. After opening the chest drawer, pick up the old key from the chest drawer. Having got the old key, make sure that the wooden door is unlocked with the old key. And then, open the wooden door. After that, travel east. That done, ensure that the refrigerator inside the kitchen is open. And then, recover the apple from the refrigerator. After taking the apple, rest the apple on the stove in the kitchen. Alright, thanks!

-= Bedroom =-
You arrive in a bedroom. An ordinary kind of place. You can barely contain your excitement.

Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a chest drawer. Now why would someone leave that there? If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's an antique trunk. You can see a king-size bed. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The king-size bed is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

<think>
Okay, let me see. The user has already opened the chest drawer, picked up the old key, and now they're asking if I'm on the right track and what the next action should be.

First, I need to recall the original task. The goal was to open the chest drawer, get the key, unlock the wooden door, open it, go east, open the fridge, get an apple, and put it on the stove. So far, the user has done the first two steps: opened the chest and picked up the key. The next step according to the plan is to use the old key to unlock the wooden door. 

Looking at the current location, the user is in the bedroom, and there's a closed wooden door leading east. The next logical step is to unlock that door with the key they just picked up. The user hasn't tried that yet, so the next command should be to unlock the door. 

Wait, but in the game's context, the action might be "unlock the wooden door" or "use the old key on the wooden door". But the previous actions were "open chest drawer" and "pick up old key". So the next step is to unlock the door with the key. The user's score is at 2/3, so they need to proceed to the next step. 

I should make sure that the command is correct. The wooden door is closed, and the key is in hand. So the next action is to unlock the door. The correct command would be "unlock wooden door" or "use old key on wooden door". But in the game's context, maybe "unlock wooden door" is the right command. Let me check the previous actions. The user was told to "make sure that the wooden door is unlocked with the old key". So the action here is to unlock it. 

Therefore, the next command should be "unlock wooden door".

Okay, let's see. The user has successfully unlocked and opened the wooden door leading east. The next step according to the original task was to travel east. So after opening the door, the next action should be to go east. The user is now in the bedroom, having opened the door, so the next command is "go east".

Wait, the current location is the bedroom, and the door leads east. After opening the door, the user should move into the next room, which is likely the kitchen based on the later tasks mentioned. So the next step is to go east. The user's score is at 4/5, so they need to proceed to the kitchen. The next action is "go east".

-= Kitchen =-
You've entered a kitchen.

Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a refrigerator. Now why would someone leave that there? You see a counter. The counter is typical. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a stove. The stove is standard. But there isn't a thing on it. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. Oh, great. Here's a kitchen island. The kitchen island is usual. On the kitchen island you can make out a note. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this!

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Okay, the user has opened the refrigerator and found a bell pepper and an apple. The next step according to the original task was to recover the apple from the refrigerator. Since the apple is already there, the next action would be to pick up the apple. But wait, the user's score is at 5/7, so they need to proceed. After getting the apple, they need to rest it on the stove. So first, take the apple, then put it on the stove. But the current location is the kitchen, and the user just opened the fridge. The next command should be to take the apple.

Wait, the task says "recover the apple from the refrigerator." So the user needs to pick it up. The correct command would be "take apple" or "pick up apple". Then, after that, put it on the stove. So the next action is to take the apple.
