Welcome to another life changing episode of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, you could, like, doublecheck that the chest drawer is opened. Once you have opened the chest drawer, recover the old key from the chest drawer within the bedroom. And then, unlock the wooden door. Then, open the wooden door. Once you have opened the wooden door, attempt to go to the east. With that accomplished, make absolutely sure that the refrigerator within the kitchen is ajar. Then, pick up the milk from the refrigerator. After taking the milk, sit the milk on the stove. Got that? Good!

-= Bedroom =-
You've entered a bedroom. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

You make out a chest drawer. You see a closed antique trunk. You can see a king-size bed. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. This always happens, here in TextWorld!

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

You are in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place. The room is well lit.

Oh, great. Here's a refrigerator. You make out a counter. The counter is ordinary. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. You see a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You can see a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island. Huh, weird.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an unblocked exit to the south.
