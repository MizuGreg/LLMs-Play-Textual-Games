Welcome to another exciting round of TextWorld! First of all, ensure that the antique trunk is open. After opening the antique trunk, take the old key from the antique trunk. And then, unlock the wooden door in the bedroom with the old key. And then, open the wooden door. Then, make an attempt to travel east. Okay, and then, doublecheck that the refrigerator is wide open. Once you have opened the refrigerator, take the bell pepper from the refrigerator. After that, rest the bell pepper on the stove inside the kitchen. That's it!

-= Bedroom =-
Look around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a bedroom.

You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a chest drawer. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You see an antique trunk. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out a king-size bed. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hm. Oh well

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps to open the antique trunk, take the old key, and then use it to unlock the wooden door in the bedroom. So far, they've successfully opened the trunk and taken the key. The next step mentioned in the original instructions was to unlock the wooden door with the old key.

Looking at the current environment description, there's a closed wooden door leading east. The user has the old key, so the logical next step is to use the key to unlock the door. The command should be "unlock wooden door with old key" or something similar. But in the game's context, maybe the exact phrasing is "unlock wooden door" since the key is already taken. Wait, the previous action was taking the key, so now they need to unlock the door. The game might require the command "unlock wooden door" or "use old key on wooden door". But the user's previous commands were "open antique trunk" and "take old key from antique trunk". The next step is to unlock the door, so the correct command would be "unlock wooden door". Let me check the previous interactions. The user was told to "unlock the wooden door in the bedroom with the old key". So the command should be "unlock wooden door" after taking the key. The system message says to only output the action, so the next command is "unlock wooden door".

Okay, the user has unlocked and opened the wooden door. The next step according to the original instructions was to "make an attempt to travel east." So after opening the door, they should try to go east. The current location is the bedroom, and after opening the door, the next command would be "go east." Let me check the previous steps. The user was in the bedroom, opened the wooden door, and now they're probably in the next room. The next action is to travel east, so the command is "go east."

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen.

You make out a closed refrigerator. You can see a counter. The counter is typical. The counter appears to be empty. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is typical. On the kitchen island you see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Okay, the user tried to "rest bell pepper on stove" but the game didn't recognize it. So I need to figure out the correct command. The original instruction was to "rest the bell pepper on the stove inside the kitchen." Maybe the correct verb is "put" instead of "rest." So the command should be "put bell pepper on stove." Let me check previous commands. The user took the bell pepper from the refrigerator, so now they need to place it on the stove. The correct command is likely "put bell pepper on stove."
