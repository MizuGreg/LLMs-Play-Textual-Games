-= Bedroom =-
You've entered a bedroom.

You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a chest drawer! You make out a closed antique trunk in the room. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a king-size bed. The king-size bed is normal. But there isn't a thing on it.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps to open the chest drawer, take the old key, and then needs to unlock the wooden door. So far, they've completed the first two steps. The next step according to the instructions is to check that the wooden door is unlocked with the old key. So the next action should be to use the key on the door.

Wait, the user has the old key now. The wooden door is closed. So the correct action is to unlock it. The command would be "unlock wooden door" or "use old key on wooden door". But in the game's context, maybe the exact phrasing matters. Let me check the previous commands. The user was told to "check that the wooden door inside the bedroom is unlocked with the old key." So the action would be to unlock the door using the key. The correct command here is likely "unlock wooden door" or "use old key on wooden door". But in the game's terminology, maybe it's "unlock" or "open". But since the key is needed, the correct action is to unlock the door. So the next step is to unlock the wooden door with the old key. The user has taken the key, so now they need to use it on the door. The next command should be "unlock wooden door".

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text adventure game. They've been following the steps given in the initial instructions. Let me recap what's been done so far.

First, they had to make the chest drawer in the bedroom ajar. They did that by opening it. Then they recovered the old key from the chest drawer. Next, they unlocked the wooden door using the key and opened it. So far, they've completed the first few steps mentioned in the original plan.

Now, the next step according to the initial instructions was to "look and see that the wooden door inside the bedroom is ajar." Wait, but they just opened the door. So maybe they need to check if it's ajar. But in the game, after opening the door, perhaps the door is considered ajar. However, the user might need to explicitly check it. But the game's feedback after opening the door says the score increased, so maybe that's considered done.

Then the next step was to "try to head east." So after opening the door, they should move east. But the current location is the bedroom, and the door leads east. So after opening the door, the next action would be to go east into the next room. However, the user's last action was opening the door, and the next prompt is asking for the next action. The user is supposed to head east now. But the game might have a specific command for that. The command would be "go east" or "move east." But in the game's context, the correct command would be "go east" since that's the direction the door leads.

But wait, the user is in the bedroom, and the door is leading east. So after opening the door, they need to move into the east room. So the next action should be "go east." However, the user might need to check if the door is ajar first. But the initial instructions said to check that the door is ajar after unlocking and opening it. But in the game, after opening the door, it's already ajar, so maybe that's done. So the next step is to go east.

Then, after going east, the next steps are to open the refrigerator, recover the tomato plant, rest it on the stove, and win. So the current step is to go east. The user's next action should be "go east." But the user's last action was opening the door, so the next command is "go east." The user is supposed to output only the command, so the answer is "go east."

-= Kitchen =-
You're now in the kitchen.

You make out a refrigerator. You make out a counter. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a stove. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You make out a kitchen island. The kitchen island is standard. On the kitchen island you make out a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

Okay, let me see. The user has been following the steps to solve the text adventure game. So far, they've opened the chest drawer, taken the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door to go east into the kitchen. Now, in the kitchen, they opened the refrigerator and found a bell pepper and a tomato plant.

The next step according to the original plan was to recover the tomato plant from the refrigerator. Since they just did that by opening the fridge, the next action should be to take the tomato plant. Then, they need to rest it on the stove. So after taking the tomato plant, they should go to the stove and place it there. Once that's done, they win.

But the user's last action was opening the refrigerator, which revealed the tomato plant. So the next command should be to take the tomato plant. Then, they need to go to the stove, which is in the kitchen. So after taking the plant, they would go to the stove and put it there. But the current prompt is asking for the next action after opening the fridge. So the immediate next step is to take the tomato plant. Then, after that, move to the stove and put it there. So the answer here is "take tomato plant".

Okay, the user tried to "rest tomato plant on stove" but the system said that's not a recognized verb. So I need to figure out the correct command. Let me think about possible actions in the kitchen. The user has the tomato plant and is in the kitchen. The goal is to rest the tomato plant on the stove.

Possible correct commands could be "put tomato plant on stove" or "place tomato plant on stove". Since "rest" isn't a valid verb here, the correct action would be "put" or "place". The user might have used "rest" instead of "put". So the next action should be "put tomato plant on stove". Let me check if that's the right command. Yes, "put" is a common verb for placing items. So the answer should be "put tomato plant on stove".
