Welcome to TextWorld! Here is how to play! First thing I need you to do is to doublecheck that the antique trunk is opened. Then, recover the old key from the antique trunk inside the bedroom. Having taken the old key, insert the old key into the wooden door inside the bedroom's lock to unlock it. After that, look and see that the wooden door is ajar. And then, travel east. With that over with, ensure that the screen door is open. And then, attempt to move east. After that, make an attempt to go south. With that accomplished, lift the apple from the floor of the garden. After that, make an attempt to take a trip north. Then, go to the west. With that over with, put the apple on the stove. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Bedroom =-
You find yourself in a bedroom. An ordinary one.

Oh, great. Here's a chest drawer. You make out an antique trunk. Huh, weird. You make out a king-size bed. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing a text adventure game called TextWorld. The goal is to follow a series of steps to reach the final objective. So far, the player has opened the antique trunk, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door, but couldn't go east because the door was still closed. Wait, no—wait, the user just tried to go east, but the game said they had to open the wooden door first. But earlier, they unlocked the door. Maybe there's a confusion here.

Wait, let me check the previous steps. The user first opened the antique trunk, took the old key, then inserted the key into the wooden door lock. Then they tried to unlock it. The game responded with "You unlock the wooden door." So the door is now open. Then the user tried to go east, but the game said "You have to open the wooden door first." That doesn't make sense because the door was just unlocked. Maybe there's a mistake in the game's response, or perhaps the user is supposed to open the door again? Or maybe the door is not actually open yet.

Wait, maybe the game's response is a trick. When you unlock a door, it's supposed to be open. But maybe the game is designed so that after unlocking, you need to open it again? That seems odd. Alternatively, maybe the user is in the bedroom, and the wooden door leading east is now open, but the game is prompting them to open it again. That might be a bug, but the user has to follow the game's instructions.

So the user's next action should be to go east, but the game says they need to open the door first. But the door was just unlocked. Maybe the game is expecting them to open it again. Alternatively, maybe the door is locked again. But according to the previous steps, the user used the key to unlock it. So perhaps the game is in a state where the door is unlocked but not open yet. So the user needs to open it. But how? The command would be "open wooden door".

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go east, and the game is just confused. But the user's last action was "go east", and the game said they need to open the door first. So the correct next step is to open the door again. But that seems redundant. Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to open the door, then go east. But the door was already unlocked. Hmm.

Wait, the user's last action was "go east", and the game responded with "You have to open the wooden door first." So the door is closed again. That suggests that unlocking the door doesn't open it. Maybe the game uses "unlock" and "open" as separate actions. So perhaps the user needs to first unlock the door, then open it. But that's not standard. Usually, unlocking a door allows you to open it. But maybe in this game, you have to use "open" after unlocking.

So the correct next step would be to open the wooden door. Then, after that, go east. So the user should first open the door, then go east. But the user tried to go east and was told to open the door first. So the next action should be to open the door. Therefore, the correct command is "open wooden door".

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this TextWorld game, and they've been following the steps given. The original goal was to complete a series of tasks, like opening the trunk, getting the key, unlocking the door, moving east, then later going to the garden, picking up an apple, putting it on the stove, etc.

So far, the user has gone through the bedroom, unlocked the door, opened the wooden door, went east to the kitchen, then north to the bathroom. The current location is the bathroom. The next step in the original instructions was to "attempt to move east" after ensuring the screen door is open. But in the bathroom, the user can't go east because the screen door is closed. Wait, the bathroom's description says there's a closed toilet, a bath, a sink, and the user is told to try going south since that's unguarded. But the original plan was to go east after opening the screen door. However, in the kitchen, the user was told to go north, which led to the bathroom. Now, in the bathroom, the user needs to figure out the next move.

Looking at the available commands, the user can try going south, which is unguarded. But the original plan was to go east after opening the screen door. However, in the kitchen, the screen door was closed, but the user opened it. Wait, no—the user was in the kitchen, then went north to the bathroom. The screen door was in the kitchen, leading east. The user opened the screen door in the kitchen, then went east to the kitchen. Wait, maybe there's confusion here. Let me check the history again.

Wait, the user's previous action was "go north" from the kitchen to the bathroom. The kitchen had a closed screen door leading east. The user had opened the wooden door (the one leading west) and then went east to the kitchen. Then, from the kitchen, they went north to the bathroom. Now, in the bathroom, the user is told to try going south. But the original plan was to go east after opening the screen door. However, the screen door was in the kitchen. So maybe the user needs to go back to the kitchen, open the screen door, then go east again. But the user is currently in the bathroom. So the next step would be to go south back to the kitchen, then check the screen door again. But the user might not have the key anymore. Wait, the key was used to unlock the door in the bedroom. The key was taken from the trunk, used to unlock the door, and then the user has it in their inventory. So the key is still with the user.

But in the current location (bathroom), the user can't go east. The screen door is in the kitchen. So the user needs to go back to the kitchen, then open the screen door again, then go east. But the user is in the bathroom, so the next step is to go south back to the kitchen. Then, from the kitchen, check the screen door. But the screen door was already opened earlier? Wait, the user had opened the wooden door (leading west) and then went east to the kitchen. Then, from the kitchen, they went north to the bathroom. So the screen door in the kitchen is closed. Wait, the kitchen's description says there's a closed screen door leading east. So the user needs to open it again. But the user has the key. Wait, the key was used to unlock the door in the bedroom. The key is for the door, not for the screen door. So maybe the screen door can be opened without the key. Or perhaps the user needs to find another way. Alternatively, maybe the user can just go east from the kitchen again once the screen door is open.

But the user is in the bathroom. The only way back is south to the kitchen. So the next action should be to go south to the kitchen. Then, from the kitchen, open the screen door (if it's closed), then go east. But the user might have already opened the screen door. Wait, in the kitchen's description, it says the screen door is closed. So the user needs to open it. But how? The user has the key, but the key was used for the wooden door. Maybe the screen door can be opened without the key. Or perhaps the user needs to use the key again. But the key is for the wooden door. Maybe the screen door is a different type. So the user needs to open the screen door, then go east. But the user is in the bathroom, so the next step is to go south to the kitchen, then open the screen door, then go east. But the user's next action is to go south from the bathroom. So the correct command is "go south".

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game, and they've been moving through different rooms. The goal seems to involve opening the antique trunk, getting the old key, unlocking the door, and then proceeding to the garden where they need to pick up an apple and put it on the stove.

So far, the user has opened the antique trunk, taken the key, unlocked the wooden door, and gone east into the kitchen. They've been moving back and forth between the kitchen, bathroom, and kitchen again. The score is at 5/12, which suggests there are more steps to reach the goal.

The next step mentioned in the original instructions was to "lift the apple from the floor of the garden." But the user hasn't reached the garden yet. They're currently in the kitchen. So the next logical step would be to find the garden. Since the kitchen has a screen door leading east, maybe that's the way to go. But the screen door is closed. The user needs to open it. Alternatively, maybe there's another path.

Wait, in the kitchen description, there's a closed screen door east and an open wooden door west. The user has been going back and forth between kitchen and bathroom. To get to the garden, perhaps they need to go east from the kitchen through the screen door. But the screen door is closed. So the user needs to open it. However, the original instructions didn't mention a key for the screen door. Maybe the old key isn't needed there. Alternatively, maybe the screen door opens without a key.

But in the current state, the user is in the kitchen, and the screen door is closed. So the next action should be to open the screen door. But the user hasn't done that yet. However, the user's last action was going south, which brought them back to the kitchen. So the next step would be to try opening the screen door east. But the user might not have the key for that. Alternatively, maybe the screen door can be opened without a key. Let me check the previous steps.

The user has the old key, which was used to unlock the wooden door. The screen door might be a different type. So perhaps the user can just open the screen door. But in the game's description, the screen door is closed. So the command would be "open screen door". But the available commands include "open ...", so maybe that's the next step. However, the user's previous actions have been moving between rooms, and the score hasn't increased yet. Wait, the score was at 5/12, but after moving between rooms, the score didn't change. So maybe the next step is to open the screen door east to get to the garden.

Alternatively, maybe the garden is accessible from another direction. But according to the current room description, the kitchen has a screen door east and a west door. The user needs to go east to the garden. So the next action should be to open the screen door. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the correct command would be "open screen door".

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps in the game as instructed. They started in the bedroom, opened the antique trunk, took the old key, unlocked the door, and moved east to the kitchen. Then they went north to the bathroom, south back to the kitchen, opened the screen door, went east to the backyard, and then south to the garden.

Now, in the garden, the prompt mentions there's a tomato plant, milk, an apple, and a shovel on the floor. The user's previous action was going south to the garden. The next step according to the original instructions was to lift the apple from the floor of the garden. So the correct action here would be to pick up the apple. The user needs to take the apple from the floor. The command should be "take apple from floor" or similar. But looking at the available commands, the exact command would be "take apple from floor" or maybe "take apple". But in the game's context, since the apple is on the floor, the correct command is "take apple from floor". However, sometimes games accept "take apple" if it's clear. But given the previous steps, the user was told to "lift the apple from the floor of the garden", so the precise command would be "take apple from floor". But let me check the available commands again. The available commands include "take ... from ...", so the correct command is "take apple from floor".

Okay, the user is trying to take the apple from the floor in the garden, but the game keeps saying they can't see any such thing. Let me check the previous messages.

Looking back, when the user was in the Garden, the description mentioned: "There is a tomato plant, a milk, an apple and a shovel on the floor." So the apple is definitely there. But the user's command "take apple from floor" isn't working. Maybe the correct syntax is "take apple" without specifying "from floor" since the apple is on the floor by default. Alternatively, maybe the game expects "take apple from floor" even though it's not necessary. But the game's response says "You can't see any such thing," which is confusing because the apple is listed.

Wait, maybe the apple is not visible? But the description explicitly states it's on the floor. Perhaps the game's parser isn't recognizing the apple as a takeable item. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to examine the floor first to see the apple. But the user hasn't done that yet. Or maybe the correct command is just "take apple" without the "from floor" part. Let me think about the available commands. The user has access to "take ... from ...", so maybe the correct command is "take apple from floor". But the game is saying it can't see the apple. That's conflicting with the description. Maybe there's a typo in the game's response, but the user has to follow the game's feedback. Since the game says the apple isn't visible, perhaps the user needs to look around again. But the user can't look, only command actions. Alternatively, maybe the apple is hidden under something else. Wait, the garden has a tomato plant, milk, apple, and shovel. The apple is listed, so it should be takeable. Maybe the user needs to use "take apple" without the "from floor" part. Let me try that. If the user says "take apple", maybe the game will accept it. But the previous attempts with "take apple from floor" failed. So perhaps the correct command is just "take apple".

-= Backyard =-
You find yourself in a backyard. A normal kind of place.

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a set of chairs. The set of chairs is usual. But the thing is empty. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a bbq. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You can make out a patio table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The patio table is typical. The patio table appears to be empty.

There is an open screen door leading west. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the game's instructions. They have the apple from the garden and now they're in the backyard. The goal was to put the apple on the stove. But in the current room, which is the backyard, there's no stove mentioned. The kitchen was earlier, but they moved to the backyard. So the stove isn't here. The user tried to put the apple on the stove, but it's not possible here. So the next step should be to go back to the kitchen where the stove is. The backyard has an open screen door leading west, which would take them back to the kitchen. Then they can go north to the kitchen and put the apple on the stove. So the correct action now is to go west through the screen door to return to the kitchen.

-= Kitchen =-
You've just sauntered into a kitchen.

Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a refrigerator. You make out a counter. The counter is ordinary. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You make out a stove. The stove appears to be empty. Sometimes, just sometimes, TextWorld can just be the worst. You can see a kitchen island. On the kitchen island you can see a note.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an unblocked exit to the south.
