Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, you could, like, look and see that the antique trunk inside the bedroom is opened. Then, recover the old key from the antique trunk. Then, make absolutely sure that the wooden door inside the bedroom is unlocked. After unlocking the wooden door, open the wooden door in the bedroom. Then, try to head east. After that, try to travel south. Once you get through with that, take the milk from the couch within the living room. Having taken the milk, attempt to travel north. That done, rest the milk on the stove inside the kitchen. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Bedroom =-
You make a grand eccentric entrance into a bedroom.

You see a closed normal looking chest drawer right there by you. You can see an antique trunk. You see a king-size bed. But the thing is empty.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game where they need to follow a series of steps to win. So far, they've opened the antique trunk and found an old key. The next steps involve unlocking and opening the wooden door in the bedroom. But every time they try to push or pull the door, it's fixed in place.

Hmm, the user is stuck on the door. They've tried pushing and pulling multiple times, but it's not working. Maybe there's another way to unlock the door. Since they have the old key, perhaps they need to use it on the door. The key might be the solution to unlock the door. Let me check the previous steps again. The key was found in the antique trunk, so maybe the key is for the wooden door. The user hasn't tried using the key on the door yet. 

Wait, the user's last action was trying to push the door again, but it didn't work. The next logical step would be to use the key to unlock the door. The key is an item they have now, so they should try using it on the door. The command would be to "use old key on wooden door" or something similar. But in the game's context, the exact command might be "unlock wooden door with key" or "use key on door". Since the game's previous interactions used "unlock" and "open", maybe the correct command is "unlock wooden door" again, but since the door is fixed, maybe the key is needed. Alternatively, the user might need to "use key on door".

But the user hasn't tried using the key yet. So the next action should be to use the key on the door. Let me make sure that's the right move. The key was found in the trunk, and the door is locked, so using the key should unlock it. Therefore, the next command should be to use the key on the door. The correct command would be "use old key on wooden door" or "unlock wooden door with key". But in the game's context, maybe it's just "unlock wooden door" again, but since the door is fixed, the key is necessary. So the user needs to try using the key on the door.

-= Kitchen =-
Well how about that, you are in a place we're calling a kitchen. The room is well lit.

You make out a closed refrigerator nearby. You can see a counter. The counter is normal. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove. You see a kitchen island. On the kitchen island you can see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

Well I'll be, you are in the place we're calling the living room.

You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a couch. You see a milk on the couch. You see a low table. The low table is standard. On the low table you see a remote. You scan the room for a tv, and you find a tv. The tv is ordinary. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Okay, the user is trying to rest the milk on the stove. The previous command "rest milk on stove" was invalid. The correct action should be "put milk on stove". Let me check the game's context. The user took the milk from the couch and now needs to put it on the stove in the kitchen. The correct verb here is "put", not "rest". So the next action should be "put milk on stove".
