Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, doublecheck that the antique trunk in the bedroom is open. Then, pick up the old key from the antique trunk. Then, make it so that the wooden door within the bedroom is unlocked. Then, open the wooden door. After opening the wooden door, venture east. Then, open the screen door. Then, make an attempt to head east. That done, take a trip south. Then, pick up the milk from the floor of the garden. After getting the milk, try to head north. That done, attempt to take a trip west. Then, sit the milk on the stove in the kitchen. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Bedroom =-
You find yourself in a bedroom. An usual one. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You can see a chest drawer. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's an antique trunk. Were you looking for a king-size bed? Because look over there, it's a king-size bed. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.

You make out a closed refrigerator in the corner. You make out a counter. The counter is normal. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a stove. The stove is ordinary. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can see a kitchen island. Now why would someone leave that there? On the kitchen island you see a note. You shudder, but continue examining the room.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

You've just sauntered into a backyard.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a set of chairs. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Sometimes, just sometimes, TextWorld can just be the worst. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a bbq. But the thing is empty. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a patio table. But the thing is empty.

There is an open screen door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in the TextWorld game. They've already completed several tasks: opening the antique trunk, picking up the key, unlocking and opening the bedroom door, moving east to the kitchen, opening the screen door, going east again to the backyard, then south to the garden. Now they're in the garden, where they need to pick up the milk from the floor.

But the user is having trouble. They tried "take milk from floor" three times, and each time it says "You can't see any such thing." Wait, looking back at the Garden description, it says: "There is a lettuce, a milk, a half of a bag of chips and a shovel on the floor." So the milk is there. Maybe the command needs to be "take milk" without specifying "from floor" since it's already on the floor. Or maybe "take milk from floor" is correct. But the game is saying it's not there. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the milk is not visible? Or perhaps the user needs to check the inventory. Wait, the user hasn't picked up the milk yet. The problem is that the game's response says "You can't see any such thing," but according to the description, the milk is on the floor. Maybe there's a typo or a misunderstanding. Alternatively, maybe the correct command is just "take milk" because it's on the floor. Let me check the available commands. The available commands include "take ... from ...", so maybe the correct command is "take milk from floor". But the game is saying it's not there. That's confusing.

Wait, maybe the user is supposed to pick up the milk first before moving north. The next step after getting the milk is to try to head north. So the user is in the garden, needs to take the milk, then go north. But the game is not allowing them to take the milk. Maybe the milk is not actually there? Or maybe the user needs to look again. But the description says it's there. Maybe the game is malfunctioning, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the correct command. Let me check the previous steps. The user tried "take milk from floor" three times, and each time it's rejected. But according to the room description, the milk is on the floor. So perhaps the correct command is just "take milk", without specifying "from floor", since it's already on the floor. Let me try that. So the next action should be "take milk".

<think>
Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is in the Garden, and they have the milk in their inventory. The goal is to put the milk on the stove in the kitchen. But when they try to "put milk on stove", the game says "You can't see any such thing." 

Wait, maybe the stove is in a different room. The user was in the Garden, then went back to the Backyard, then back to the Garden. The stove is in the Kitchen. So the user needs to go back to the Kitchen to put the milk on the stove. But how do they get back to the Kitchen?

Looking at the previous steps: After picking up the milk in the Garden, the user tried to go north, which took them back to the Backyard. Then they tried going south again to the Garden. But the stove is in the Kitchen, which is east of the Backyard? Or maybe the Kitchen is accessible from the Backyard?

Wait, in the Backyard description, there's an open screen door leading west, and a south entranceway. The Kitchen was previously accessed from the Bedroom, then the Kitchen, then the Backyard, then the Garden. So maybe the user needs to go back through the screen door west from the Backyard to the Kitchen. But in the Backyard, the screen door is leading west, which would take them back to the Kitchen. Then, once in the Kitchen, they can put the milk on the stove.

But the user is currently in the Garden. They need to go back to the Backyard, then west to the Kitchen. Then, in the Kitchen, put the milk on the stove. So the next steps would be: go south (from Garden to Backyard), then go west (from Backyard to Kitchen), then put milk on stove.

But the user is in the Garden, and the last action was trying to put milk on stove, which failed. So the correct next step is to go back to the Kitchen. So the command should be "go south" to get back to the Backyard, then "go west" to the Kitchen. Then, in the Kitchen, "put milk on stove".

But the user is in the Garden, so first, they need to go south to Backyard, then west to Kitchen. Then, in the Kitchen, put the milk on the stove. So the next command should be "go south" to move back to the Backyard.

-= Backyard =-
You've just sauntered into a backyard.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a set of chairs. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Sometimes, just sometimes, TextWorld can just be the worst. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a bbq. But the thing is empty. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a patio table. But the thing is empty.

There is an open screen door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.

You make out a closed refrigerator in the corner. You make out a counter. The counter is normal. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a stove. The stove is ordinary. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can see a kitchen island. Now why would someone leave that there? On the kitchen island you see a note. You shudder, but continue examining the room.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.
