It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First stop, open the chest drawer. And then, pick up the old key from the chest drawer within the bedroom. After picking up the old key, make it so that the wooden door is unlocked. After that, ensure that the wooden door within the bedroom is open. After that, move east. With that done, open the screen door. And then, go east. Following that, try to move south. Okay, and then, recover the apple from the floor of the garden. If you can get your hands on the apple, head north. That done, try to head west. And then, put the apple on the stove in the kitchen. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Bedroom =-
You find yourself in a bedroom. A typical kind of place. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You see a chest drawer. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can make out a closed antique trunk here. You see a king-size bed. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You swear loudly.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

-= Kitchen =-
You've just sauntered into a kitchen.

You make out a closed refrigerator. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. But there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the counter. You see a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a kitchen island! The kitchen island is normal. On the kitchen island you can see a note. Huh, weird.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

However, the bbq, like an empty bbq, has nothing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a patio table! The patio table is usual. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

There is an open screen door leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in the Garden scene. They need to recover the apple from the floor. The previous attempts to "take apple from floor" didn't work. The game message says there's an apple on the floor, but the player can't see it. Maybe the issue is that the apple is hidden or not directly visible.

Wait, the user tried "recover apple" but that's not a valid command. Then they tried "take apple from floor," which also didn't work. The game says "You can't see any such thing." So maybe the apple is not in the floor but somewhere else? Let me check the description again.

In the Garden scene, the message says: "There is a milk, an apple, a lettuce and a shovel on the floor." So the apple is indeed on the floor. But the player can't see it. Maybe the command should be "take apple" without specifying the floor, or perhaps "pick up apple." Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "take apple from floor," but the game isn't recognizing it. Or maybe the apple is hidden under something else.

Alternatively, maybe the player needs to look around again, but the previous "look around" didn't help. Wait, the user tried "look around" and got "You can't see any such thing." That's confusing because the game says the apple is on the floor. Maybe there's a typo or a miscommunication. The correct command might be "take apple" or "pick up apple." Let me check the available commands. The user is in the Garden, and the possible actions are moving directions or interacting with objects. Since the apple is on the floor, the correct command should be "take apple" or "pick up apple." But the game might require the exact phrasing. Maybe "take apple from floor" is correct, but the game is not recognizing it. Alternatively, maybe the apple is not visible, so the player needs to look again. But the user tried that already. Hmm. The next step would be to try "take apple" without specifying the floor, or maybe "pick up apple." Let's try that.

Okay, the user is stuck in the Garden scene where they need to recover the apple. They've tried "take apple from floor" multiple times, but the game keeps saying "You can't see any such thing." The description mentions that there's an apple on the floor, so why isn't the player able to pick it up?

Wait, maybe the apple is hidden or not directly visible. The game might require a different command. Let me check the possible actions again. The user has already tried "take apple from floor," which didn't work. Maybe the correct command is just "take apple" without specifying the floor. Alternatively, perhaps the apple is in a different location than described. But the game message clearly states that the apple is on the floor.

Another possibility is that the player needs to look around again, but they've already done that. Maybe the game is expecting a different verb, like "pick up" instead of "take." Let me try "pick up apple from floor." But the user has tried "take" multiple times. Maybe the game is case-sensitive, so "Take apple from floor" with a capital T? But the user has been using lowercase.

Alternatively, maybe the apple is not on the floor but somewhere else. Wait, the game says "on the floor," so that's not it. Maybe the player needs to interact with another object first. But the only other objects are milk, lettuce, shovel. Maybe the apple is under the shovel? But the user hasn't checked that.

Alternatively, maybe the game is broken, but that's unlikely. The user needs to find the correct command. Since "take apple from floor" isn't working, perhaps the correct command is just "take apple." Let me try that. If that doesn't work, maybe "pick up apple." But the user has to follow the game's expected syntax. Since the game says the apple is on the floor, the correct command should be "take apple from floor," but the game isn't recognizing it. Maybe the user needs to try a different approach. Maybe the apple is hidden, so the player needs to look again. But the user tried that. Hmm. Maybe the next step is to try "take apple" without the floor part. Let's try that.

However, the bbq, like an empty bbq, has nothing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a patio table! The patio table is usual. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

There is an open screen door leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

You've just sauntered into a kitchen.

You make out a closed refrigerator. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. But there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the counter. You see a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a kitchen island! The kitchen island is normal. On the kitchen island you can see a note. Huh, weird.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user has been stuck in the Garden for a while, trying to take the apple from the floor. They tried "take apple from floor" multiple times, but it didn't work. Then they managed to pick up the apple by just typing "take apple," which worked. After that, they started moving around again, going back and forth between the Kitchen, Bathroom, and Kitchen again. Now they're in the Bathroom again, and the system is asking if they're on the right track.

So, the user's current goal is to put the apple on the stove in the kitchen. They have the apple in their inventory now. The last action was going north to the Bathroom, then south back to the Kitchen. Now, they need to get back to the Kitchen where the stove is. Since they're in the Bathroom again, they need to go south to return to the Kitchen. Once there, they can go to the stove and put the apple on it. The correct command would be "go south" to get back to the Kitchen, then "put apple on stove." But since the user is currently in the Bathroom, the next step is to go south again. The system's last response was "go south" leading them back to the Kitchen. Then, from the Kitchen, they can proceed to put the apple on the stove. So the next action should be "put apple on stove" once they're in the Kitchen.
