Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First, it would be great if you could assure that the chest drawer is ajar. Then, take the old key from the chest drawer. If you can get your hands on the old key, unlock the wooden door. And then, make it so that the wooden door is ajar. And then, move east. With that over with, ensure that the screen door is open. And then, make an attempt to move east. Next, go to the south. After that, lift the lettuce from the floor of the garden. After that, go north. Okay, and then, venture west. That done, rest the lettuce on the stove. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Bedroom =-
You're now in the bedroom. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You can make out a closed chest drawer. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than an antique trunk, so there's that. You scan the room, seeing a king-size bed. The king-size bed is typical. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps given in the initial instructions. They started by opening the chest drawer, taking the old key, then the next step was to unlock the wooden door. The user hasn't done that yet. So the next logical step after taking the key would be to use it to unlock the door. The goal was to unlock the door and then move east. So the next action should be to unlock the wooden door with the key. Then, after that, move east as instructed. The user's current score is 2/3, so they need to proceed with the remaining steps. The answer should be "unlock wooden door" since that's the next step in the sequence.

Okay, the user tried to move east but the game responded with "You must name something more substantial." That suggests that the command "move east" wasn't recognized. Maybe the game expects a different phrase, like "go east" instead of "move east." Let me check the previous interactions. The user had to use "go north" in the beginning, so perhaps "go east" is the correct command here. The next step after unlocking the door is to move east, so the correct command should be "go east." The user's score is 3/5, so they need to proceed with the right command.

Okay, the user is trying to follow the steps to solve the game. They started by opening the chest drawer, taking the key, unlocking the door, but the game is prompting them again. The previous attempt to "go east" was rejected because the door wasn't open. Wait, but they just unlocked the door. Maybe the game considers the door as unlocked but not open yet? Or maybe the command is different. The user tried "unlock wooden door" again, and the response was "That's unlocked at the moment." So maybe the door is unlocked but not open. The next step should be to open the door. But the initial instruction said to "make it so that the wooden door is ajar" after unlocking. So perhaps the correct command is "open wooden door" instead of "unlock." But the user already used the key to unlock it. Maybe the game requires them to open it after unlocking. Alternatively, maybe the door is locked and needs to be opened with the key. Wait, the user has the key, so they need to use it to open the door. But the game might have specific commands. The user's last action was "unlock wooden door," which the game said was already unlocked. So maybe the next step is to "open wooden door" to make it ajar. Then, after that, move east. So the next command should be "open wooden door."

You've come into an ordinary room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be ordinary. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the kitchen. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You make out a refrigerator. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a counter, go to TextWorld. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Were you looking for a stove? Because look over there, it's a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? The stove appears to be empty. You move on, clearly infuriated by TextWorld. You scan the room for a kitchen island, and you find a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the kitchen now. The original goal was to go through several steps: open the chest drawer, take the key, unlock the door, make it ajar, move east, then go south, pick up lettuce, go north, venture west, rest the lettuce on the stove. Then they'd win.

So far, they've opened the chest drawer, taken the key, unlocked the door, opened it, and moved east to the kitchen. The current location is the kitchen. The next steps from here would be to ensure the screen door is open (as per the initial instructions), then try to move east again. But the user just moved east into the kitchen, so maybe the screen door is leading to another area. Wait, the kitchen has a closed screen door east, open door west, and exits north and south. The user's next task was to "ensure that the screen door is open." So they need to open the screen door. Then, after that, attempt to move east again. But the user's last action was "go east" which led them to the kitchen. Now, in the kitchen, the screen door is closed. So the next step should be to open the screen door. Then, after opening it, move east again. But the user's current score is 5/9, so they need to proceed with opening the screen door. The correct command would be "open screen door."

Okay, the user is in the kitchen and tried to "go east" again, but the game didn't recognize it. Let me check the previous steps. The user opened the screen door east in the kitchen, which is now open. The next step according to the original plan was to move east again. But the game might be expecting a different command. Earlier, when in the bedroom, the user used "go north" and "move east". Maybe "move east" is the correct command here. Alternatively, since the screen door is open, maybe the user needs to "enter screen door" or "go through screen door". But the game might accept "move east" again. Let me try "move east" as the next command.
