You are now playing a profound game of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to open the antique trunk in the bedroom. After that, pick up the old key from the antique trunk. After picking up the old key, assure that the wooden door is unlocked. And then, open the wooden door inside the bedroom. And then, attempt to go east. Following that, go to the south. Then, recover the apple from the couch in the living room. After that, try to venture north. After that, put the apple on the stove. Got that? Good!

-= Bedroom =-
Well, here we are in a bedroom.

You see a closed chest drawer. You see a closed antique trunk in the room. You can see a king-size bed. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hopefully, this discovery doesn't ruin your TextWorld experience!

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, let me see. The user has been following the steps to open the antique trunk, pick up the key, and now they need to unlock the wooden door. The next step in the instructions was to "assure that the wooden door is unlocked." So, after picking up the key, the next logical action would be to use the key to unlock the door.

Wait, but the user just picked up the key, so they need to go to the wooden door and unlock it. The current location is the bedroom, and the wooden door leading east is closed. The user has to unlock it. Since they have the key, they should try to unlock the door. The command would be "unlock wooden door" or something similar. But in TextWorld, the exact phrasing might matter. Let me check the previous commands. The user was told to "assure that the wooden door is unlocked," so maybe the correct action is to unlock it. But the user has the key, so they need to use it on the door. The correct command would be "unlock wooden door" or "use key on wooden door." But in the game's context, maybe "unlock wooden door" is the right command. Let me make sure. The previous actions were "open antique trunk" and "pick up old key," so the next step is to unlock the door. The user is in the bedroom, and the door is leading east. So the next action should be to unlock the door. The command would be "unlock wooden door." But the user might need to first go to the door. Wait, the door is in the room, so maybe they can unlock it directly. But the game might require the user to be near the door. However, the user is in the bedroom, and the door is part of the room. So the correct action is to unlock the wooden door. Let me confirm. The user has the key, so they can unlock the door. The next step is to unlock the door. So the command is "unlock wooden door."

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps correctly. They opened the antique trunk, picked up the old key, unlocked the wooden door, and opened it. Now they need to go east. The next step in the original goal was to attempt to go east after opening the door. So the next action should be "go east". But wait, the user is in the bedroom, and after opening the wooden door leading east, they would move into the next room. The instruction says after opening the door, go east. But maybe the door is the only way to go east. So the correct command here is "go east". The user has to make sure they are in the right location. Since the wooden door was opened, moving east would be the next step. Then, after going east, they need to go south, recover the apple, etc. So the next action is "go east".

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. An usual one. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You can make out a refrigerator. You see a counter. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the counter. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove! The stove is ordinary. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a kitchen island. You shudder, but continue examining the kitchen island. The kitchen island is normal. On the kitchen island you can make out a note. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this!

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an unguarded exit to the north. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

-= Living Room =-
You are in a living room. An ordinary kind of place.

You can see a couch. The couch is standard. On the couch you can see an apple. You smell a great smell, and follow it to a low table. On the low table you see a remote. You can make out a tv. The tv is typical. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps given in the original task. They started in the bedroom, opened the antique trunk, picked up the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, then went east to the kitchen, south to the living room. Now, in the living room, they need to recover the apple from the couch and then put it on the stove.

The current location is the Living Room. The user just arrived here after going south from the kitchen. The next step according to the original plan is to recover the apple from the couch. So the next action should be to pick up the apple. Then, after that, they need to go north to the kitchen, but first, the apple must be picked up. The user's last action was "go south", leading them to the living room. Now, the immediate next step is to pick up the apple from the couch. So the correct command here is "pick up apple".

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps given in the original task. They started in the bedroom, opened the antique trunk, picked up the key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, then went east to the kitchen, south to the living room, picked up the apple, and then went north back to the kitchen.

Now, the current location is the kitchen again, with the score at 7/9. The next step according to the original plan was to put the apple on the stove. The user has the apple in their inventory since they picked it up in the living room. The stove is in the kitchen, so the next logical step is to go to the stove and place the apple there. The command should be "put apple on stove". But I need to check if the stove is accessible. The kitchen description mentions the stove is ordinary and there's nothing on it. Since the user is in the kitchen, they can interact with the stove. So the correct action is to put the apple on the stove.
