You are now playing a life changing round of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First off, make absolutely sure that the antique trunk is ajar. Then, retrieve the old key from the antique trunk. And then, make absolutely sure that the wooden door in the bedroom is unlocked. And then, look and see that the wooden door is open. And then, make an attempt to head east. And then, open the refrigerator inside the kitchen. If you have opened the refrigerator, pick up the lettuce from the refrigerator. And then, sit the lettuce on the stove inside the kitchen. Alright, thanks!

-= Bedroom =-
You are in a bedroom. A normal kind of place. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You can see a chest drawer. You can see a closed antique trunk, which looks usual, right there by you. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a king-size bed. The king-size bed is normal. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me try to figure out what to do next. The user is in a bedroom, and the goal is to open the wooden door in the bedroom. But the game says they have to unlock it with the old key first. So far, they tried going east, but the door is closed. Then they tried opening the door, but it's locked. The next step is to get the old key.

Wait, the user mentioned that the antique trunk is closed. The first step was to make sure the trunk is ajar. So maybe they need to open the trunk first. Then retrieve the old key from there. Once they have the key, they can unlock the wooden door. But in the current state, they haven't opened the trunk yet. So the next action should be to open the antique trunk. Let me check the previous steps again.

The user's initial instructions said: make sure the antique trunk is ajar, retrieve the old key from the trunk, then unlock the wooden door, then open the door, then go east. Then go to the kitchen, open the fridge, get lettuce, put it on the stove. But the current problem is that the wooden door is locked. So the key is probably in the trunk. So the next step is to open the trunk. Let me confirm the current state.

In the bedroom, the user sees a closed antique trunk. So the first thing to do is open that trunk. Then look inside for the old key. Once they have the key, they can unlock the door. So the next action should be to open the antique trunk. That makes sense. The user hasn't done that yet. So the answer is to open the antique trunk.

Okay, let me see. The user has already opened the antique trunk and taken the old key. The next step according to the initial instructions was to make sure the wooden door in the bedroom is unlocked. Since they have the key, they need to use it to unlock the door. The game previously mentioned that the door is locked, so using the key to unlock it makes sense. After unlocking, they need to open the door and then go east. So the next action should be to unlock the wooden door with the old key. Let me check the current state again.

The user is in the bedroom, has the key. The wooden door is closed and locked. So the correct action is to unlock it. The command would be "unlock the wooden door" or "use the old key on the wooden door". But the game might expect a specific command. Looking back at previous interactions, when the user tried to open the door, it said they needed to unlock it with the key. So the next step is to unlock the door. Therefore, the next action is to unlock the wooden door using the key. The correct command here is "unlock the wooden door".

Okay, let's see. The user has successfully unlocked and opened the wooden door leading east. The next step in the original plan was to "make an attempt to head east." So after opening the door, they should try going east. The previous action was opening the door, so the next command should be "go east." That makes sense. Let me check if there are any other steps needed. The initial instructions also mentioned going to the kitchen, opening the fridge, getting lettuce, and putting it on the stove. But the current focus is on the bedroom door. So after going east, they'll enter the next room, probably the kitchen. So the next action is definitely "go east."

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. An ordinary one.

You make out a refrigerator, so there's that. What's that over there? It looks like it's a counter. The counter is normal. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What's the point of an empty counter? You can see a stove. The stove is normal. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You make out a kitchen island. On the kitchen island you see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the kitchen and just opened the refrigerator, finding lettuce and a half-bag of chips. The next step according to the original plan was to pick up the lettuce from the refrigerator. So after opening it, they should take the lettuce. The command would be "take lettuce". But wait, the game might require specifying the item. Let me check the previous steps. The user said "open the refrigerator" and found the lettuce. Now, the next action is to pick it up. So the correct command is "take lettuce" or "pick up lettuce". The game's previous interactions used "take" for picking items up. So the next action should be "take lettuce".

Okay, the user tried to "sit the lettuce on the stove" but the game didn't understand that. Let me think about the correct command. In text-based games, actions are usually straightforward. The user has the lettuce in hand. To place it on the stove, the correct command is likely "put lettuce on stove" or "put the lettuce on the stove". The game might expect the exact phrasing. Since the user said "sit the lettuce on the stove", maybe the game doesn't recognize "sit" as a valid verb here. The correct action is to "put" the lettuce on the stove. So the next command should be "put lettuce on stove".
