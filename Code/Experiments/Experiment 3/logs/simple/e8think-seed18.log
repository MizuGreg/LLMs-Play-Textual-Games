Welcome to TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, you could, like, open the chest drawer. Then, pick up the old key from the chest drawer. After picking up the old key, assure that the wooden door is unlocked. Then, ensure that the wooden door is open. After pulling open the wooden door, take a trip east. And then, make sure that the screen door is wide open. After that, make an effort to move east. With that done, attempt to take a trip south. Then, pick-up the bell pepper from the floor of the garden. And then, attempt to go to the north. If you can succeed at that, make an effort to take a trip west. And then, rest the bell pepper on the stove. Got that? Good!

-= Bedroom =-
You are in a bedroom. A standard kind of place.

You can make out a chest drawer. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You see a closed antique trunk close by. Look over there! a king-size bed. The king-size bed appears to be empty.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. A standard one.

You see a refrigerator. You check the price tag that's still affixed to the refrigerator. 100 bucks? What a deal! You'll have to ask where they got this! You see a counter. The counter is typical. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. Look over there! a kitchen island. You wonder idly who left that here. The kitchen island is usual. On the kitchen island you see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Backyard =-
You've entered a backyard. You can barely contain your excitement.

You scan the room for a set of chairs, and you find a set of chairs! The set of chairs is typical. But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? What's that over there? It looks like it's a bbq. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a bbq, go to TextWorld. However, the bbq, like an empty bbq, has nothing on it. You can see a patio table. The patio table is normal. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

There is an open screen door leading west. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

-= Garden =-
I am so happy to announce that you are now in the garden. You begin to take stock of what's here.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked.

There is a half of a bag of chips, a bell pepper, an apple and a shovel on the floor.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in the Garden now, and they have to pick up the bell pepper from the floor. The next step after that is to attempt to go north, and if successful, then go west. Then rest the bell pepper on the stove.

So the current location is the Garden. The user has already picked up the bell pepper, right? Wait, no. The prompt says: "pick-up the bell pepper from the floor of the garden." So the user needs to pick it up. The current description says there's a bell pepper on the floor. So the next action should be to pick up the bell pepper.

Wait, but the user's last action was going south to the Garden, and the score is 8/9. The next step in the original task was after picking up the bell pepper, attempt to go north. So first, pick up the bell pepper. Then go north. Then go west. Then rest the bell pepper on the stove.

So in the Garden, the user needs to pick up the bell pepper. The command would be "pick up bell pepper". But in TextWorld, sometimes you have to use specific commands. Let me check the previous actions. The user has been using commands like "open the chest drawer", "pick up the old key", etc. So probably, the correct command here is "pick up bell pepper".

After that, the next step is to attempt to go north. So after picking up the bell pepper, the user should try "go north". Then, if that works, go west. Then rest the bell pepper on the stove.

So the current step is to pick up the bell pepper. The user is in the Garden, and the bell pepper is on the floor. So the next command is "pick up bell pepper".
