Welcome to TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, you could, like, open the chest drawer. Then, pick up the old key from the chest drawer. After picking up the old key, assure that the wooden door is unlocked. Then, ensure that the wooden door is open. After pulling open the wooden door, take a trip east. And then, make sure that the screen door is wide open. After that, make an effort to move east. With that done, attempt to take a trip south. Then, pick-up the bell pepper from the floor of the garden. And then, attempt to go to the north. If you can succeed at that, make an effort to take a trip west. And then, rest the bell pepper on the stove. Got that? Good!

-= Bedroom =-
You are in a bedroom. A standard kind of place.

You can make out a chest drawer. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You see a closed antique trunk close by. Look over there! a king-size bed. The king-size bed appears to be empty.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

You arrive in a kitchen. A standard one.

You see a refrigerator. You check the price tag that's still affixed to the refrigerator. 100 bucks? What a deal! You'll have to ask where they got this! You see a counter. The counter is typical. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. Look over there! a kitchen island. You wonder idly who left that here. The kitchen island is usual. On the kitchen island you see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Backyard =-
You've entered a backyard. You can barely contain your excitement.

You scan the room for a set of chairs, and you find a set of chairs! The set of chairs is typical. But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? What's that over there? It looks like it's a bbq. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a bbq, go to TextWorld. However, the bbq, like an empty bbq, has nothing on it. You can see a patio table. The patio table is normal. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

There is an open screen door leading west. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me see. The user has been following the steps given in the initial task. They started in the bedroom, opened the chest drawer, picked up the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, then went east to the kitchen. They opened the screen door, went east again to the backyard, then south to the garden. In the garden, they picked up the bell pepper. Now they're at the garden, and the next step according to the original task was to attempt to go north. The user is asking if they're on the right track and if they're close to the goal.

Looking at the current location, the garden has a north exit that's unblocked. The next step mentioned in the task was to go north, then west, and then rest the bell pepper on the stove. So the next action should be to go north. The user needs to move north from the garden. The previous steps have been followed correctly, so the next command should be "go north".

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user has been moving between the kitchen, bathroom, and backyard, but they're stuck in a loop between the kitchen and bathroom. The original goal was to eventually rest the bell pepper on the stove. But right now, they're at the bathroom again after trying to go north from the kitchen.

Wait, the last action was going north from the kitchen, which led to the bathroom. Then, going south back to the kitchen. This back-and-forth suggests they might be stuck in a cycle. The user is asking if they're on the right track. 

Looking back at the steps: They picked up the bell pepper in the garden. The next step was to go north from the garden, which they did, leading to the backyard. Then west to the kitchen, then north to the bathroom, then south back to kitchen. But the original plan was to go north from the garden, then west, then rest the bell pepper on the stove. 

Wait, maybe they didn't proceed correctly after the garden. After picking up the bell pepper in the garden, the next step was to go north, which they did, but that took them to the backyard again. Then they went west to the kitchen. But the original task said after going east from the garden, they needed to attempt to go south, then west, then rest the bell pepper on the stove. 

Hmm, perhaps the user is confused about the directions. The garden's north exit leads to the backyard, but the stove is in the kitchen. So after getting the bell pepper, they need to go back to the kitchen. But they kept going north and south between kitchen and bathroom, missing the path back to the kitchen. 

Wait, in the garden, after picking up the bell pepper, the next step was to go north. But going north from the garden leads to the backyard, not the kitchen. The kitchen is accessible from the backyard via the screen door leading east. So maybe the user went west from the backyard to the kitchen, but then got stuck in the loop. 

The user needs to rest the bell pepper on the stove. The stove is in the kitchen. So after getting the bell pepper, they should go back to the kitchen. But they went north to the backyard, then west to the kitchen. Then tried going north again, which led to the bathroom. 

So the correct path after the garden is: go north to backyard, then east through the screen door back to the kitchen, then rest the bell pepper on the stove. But the user is stuck in the kitchen-bathroom loop. 

Therefore, the next action should be to go east from the kitchen (since the screen door is open east) to return to the backyard, then proceed to the kitchen again to place the bell pepper on the stove. But the user is currently in the kitchen, so maybe they need to go east again to the backyard, then back to the kitchen. Alternatively, maybe the stove is in the kitchen, so once in the kitchen, they can rest the bell pepper there. 

Wait, the user has the bell pepper. They are in the kitchen. The stove is in the kitchen. So the next step is to rest the bell pepper on the stove. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the correct action is to rest the bell pepper on the stove. But the previous steps didn't include that. 

Wait, the original task said: after moving east, attempt to go south, then west, then rest the bell pepper on the stove. So after getting the bell pepper in the garden, they need to go north to backyard, then east to kitchen, then rest the bell pepper on the stove. 

But the user is in the kitchen, so the next step is to rest the bell pepper on the stove. However, the user hasn't done that yet. So the correct action is to rest the bell pepper on the stove. But the user is in the kitchen, so they can do that. 

But in the current state, the user is in the kitchen, and the previous action was going north to the bathroom. So they need to go south back to the kitchen, then rest the bell pepper. But the user is already in the kitchen. Wait, the last action was going north from the kitchen to the bathroom, then south back to the kitchen. So now they are in the kitchen again. 

Therefore, the next step is to rest the bell pepper on the stove. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the correct action is to rest the bell pepper on the stove. However, the user might not have the bell pepper in hand. Wait, they picked it up in the garden. So they should have it. 

So the next action should be to rest the bell pepper on the stove. But the user is in the kitchen, so that's possible. Therefore, the next command is "rest the bell pepper on the stove".

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the kitchen and bathroom. They've been trying to go north and south repeatedly. The original goal was to rest the bell pepper on the stove. The user has the bell pepper, but they're in the bathroom now. The stove is in the kitchen. So the correct action is to go back to the kitchen, then rest the bell pepper on the stove. But the user is in the bathroom, so they need to go south to the kitchen. Then, once in the kitchen, they can rest the bell pepper. The previous attempts to "rest the bell pepper on the stove" were unsuccessful because they were in the bathroom. So the next step is to go south to the kitchen, then rest the bell pepper.
</think>go south

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. A standard one.

You see a refrigerator. You check the price tag that's still affixed to the refrigerator. 100 bucks? What a deal! You'll have to ask where they got this! You see a counter. The counter is typical. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. Look over there! a kitchen island. You wonder idly who left that here. The kitchen island is usual. On the kitchen island you see a note.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

Okay, the user is stuck in the kitchen again, trying to rest the bell pepper on the stove. The problem is that "rest the bell pepper on the stove" isn't a valid command. The correct action should be to place the bell pepper on the stove. But since the user can't use that phrase, maybe they need to use a different verb. In text adventures, common verbs for putting items down are "put" or "place". So the correct command should be "put the bell pepper on the stove" or "place the bell pepper on the stove". The user has been trying "rest", which isn't recognized. So the next step is to use the correct verb. The user is in the kitchen, which has a stove, so the action is possible. The answer should be to use "put" or "place" instead of "rest".
</think>put the bell pepper on the stove
