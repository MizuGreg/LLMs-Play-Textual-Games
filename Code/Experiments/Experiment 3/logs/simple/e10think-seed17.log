Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, you could, like, ensure that the chest drawer is open. And then, take the old key from the chest drawer inside the bedroom. With the old key, doublecheck that the wooden door is unlocked. And then, open the wooden door within the bedroom. Then, attempt to go east. Then, make absolutely sure that the screen door inside the kitchen is opened. And then, attempt to venture east. Next, travel south. And then, lift the half of a bag of chips from the floor of the garden. Then, make an effort to move north. If you can finish that, venture west. And then, rest the half of a bag of chips on the stove. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Bedroom =-
You've just sauntered into a bedroom. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

You can see a chest drawer. You can see an antique trunk. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You see a king-size bed. The king-size bed is usual. The king-size bed appears to be empty.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You see a stove. The stove is ordinary. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is ordinary. On the kitchen island you see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text adventure game called TextWorld, and they've followed a set of instructions to complete tasks. The goal is to pick up items and place them in specific locations to win.

So far, the user has done the following steps:
1. Opened the chest drawer in the bedroom and took the old key.
2. Unlocked and opened the wooden door in the bedroom, then went east to the kitchen.
3. Opened the screen door in the kitchen and went east to the backyard.
4. Went south to the garden, where they saw a half of a bag of chips on the floor.

The user tried to take the half of a bag of chips from the floor, but the game said they can't see any such thing. That's confusing because the description mentioned the half of a bag of chips was on the floor. Maybe there's a typo or a misunderstanding in the game's response. But according to the game's message, the user can't see it, so perhaps they need to check again or find another way.

The next step in the original task was to lift the half of a bag of chips from the floor of the garden. Since the user tried that and failed, maybe they need to try a different action. The user is now asking if they're on the right track and what their next action should be.

Looking at the current location (garden), the user needs to take the half of a bag of chips. The game's response said they can't see it, but the description says it's there. Maybe the user needs to look more carefully or use a different command. Alternatively, maybe the game is expecting a specific command like "pick up" instead of "take".

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to move to a different part of the garden or check another location. But according to the garden description, the half of a bag of chips is on the floor. So the correct action should be to take it. The game's response might be a glitch, but the user should try again.

The next step would be to try taking the half of a bag of chips again, or perhaps use a different verb. The user's previous attempt was "take half of a bag of chips from floor", which the game rejected. Maybe the correct command is "take half of a bag of chips" without specifying the floor, or "pick up half of a bag of chips".

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to move to the north or another direction to find it. But according to the garden description, the item is on the floor. So the correct action is to take it. The game's response might be incorrect, but the user should proceed with the command again.

Okay, the user is stuck in the Garden scene trying to pick up the half of a bag of chips. They've tried "take half of a bag of chips from floor" multiple times, but the game keeps saying it can't see it. The description in the Garden says there's an apple, lettuce, the half of a bag of chips, and a shovel on the floor. So the item is definitely there.

Maybe the issue is with the command structure. The game might expect a different verb or phrasing. Instead of "take from floor," perhaps it's just "take half of a bag of chips" since the location is the floor. Or maybe "pick up" instead of "take." The user has been using "take" but maybe the game wants "pick up."

Alternatively, the game might have a typo or misunderstanding. The user's previous attempt was "take half of a bag of chips from floor," which the game rejected. But the description says the item is on the floor, so the correct command should be to take it without specifying the floor, as the floor is the current location.

So the next action should be to "pick up half of a bag of chips" or "take half of a bag of chips." The user needs to try a different command. Since the game is not accepting "take from floor," maybe just "take" is sufficient. Let's try that.

Okay, the user is trying to rest the half of a bag of chips on the stove in the Garden. But the game says "That's not a verb I recognise." So the command "rest half of a bag of chips on stove" is invalid.

Wait, maybe the correct verb is "put" instead of "rest"? In text adventures, "put" is a common verb for placing items. The user might have used "rest" which isn't recognized. So the correct command should be "put half of a bag of chips on stove".

Let me check the previous steps. The user picked up the half of a bag of chips, so now they need to place it on the stove. The stove is in the kitchen, but the user is in the garden. Wait, no, the current location is the garden. The stove is in the kitchen, which is east of the backyard. But the user is in the garden, so maybe they need to move to the kitchen first?

Wait, the user's last action was in the garden. The stove is in the kitchen. So the user needs to go back to the kitchen. But the original task said after picking up the chips in the garden, they need to move north, then west, and rest the chips on the stove. But the user is stuck in the garden trying to rest the chips. Maybe the stove is in the garden? No, the garden description doesn't mention a stove. The stove is in the kitchen.

So the user is in the garden, has the chips, needs to go to the kitchen, then put the chips on the stove. But the current prompt is in the garden, so the user needs to move to the kitchen first. But the user's last action was in the garden, so maybe they need to go north to the kitchen. But the garden's description says there's an exit to the north. So the next step should be to go north to the kitchen, then put the chips on the stove.

But the user is trying to rest the chips in the garden, which isn't possible. So the correct action is to go north to the kitchen, then put the chips on the stove. But the user is in the garden, so the next command should be "go north" to reach the kitchen. Then, once in the kitchen, use "put half of a bag of chips on stove".

But the user's current location is the garden, so the correct next step is to go north. However, the user's last action was in the garden, and the game is in the garden scene. So the user needs to move to the kitchen first. Therefore, the next command should be "go north" to reach the kitchen, then "put half of a bag of chips on stove".

-= Backyard =-
You find yourself in a backyard. A typical one. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

You see a set of chairs. The set of chairs appears to be empty. You move on, clearly depressed by your TextWorld experience. You see a bbq. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a patio table. The patio table is normal. But the thing is empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the patio table.

There is an open screen door leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. An usual kind of place.

You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a refrigerator. Hmmm... what else, what else? You smell an intriguing smell, and follow it to a counter. The counter is standard. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You see a stove. The stove is ordinary. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is ordinary. On the kitchen island you see a note.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.
