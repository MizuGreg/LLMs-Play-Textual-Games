I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First off, ensure that the antique trunk within the bedroom is open. After that, recover the old key from the antique trunk. After that, make it so that the wooden door in the bedroom is unlocked with the old key. And then, make absolutely sure that the wooden door inside the bedroom is ajar. After opening the wooden door, go east. Then, doublecheck that the screen door is wide open. And then, attempt to travel east. And then, try to travel south. With that done, lift the milk from the floor of the garden. After stealing the milk, head north. And then, attempt to travel west. With that done, rest the milk on the stove. That's it!

-= Bedroom =-
I am sorry to announce that you are now in the bedroom. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a chest drawer. You scan the room for an antique trunk, and you find an antique trunk. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to a king-size bed. The king-size bed is standard. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. You think about smashing the king-size bed to bits, throwing the bits in the dump, etc, until you get bored.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

But there isn't a thing on it. You can see a kitchen island. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? On the kitchen island you can see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what the next step should be. The user has been following a series of tasks in the TextWorld game. So far, they've opened the antique trunk, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door, opened it, and then went east into the kitchen. The current location is the kitchen, and the user is asked to decide the next action.

Looking back at the original task list, after opening the wooden door and going east to the kitchen, the next steps mentioned were: double-check that the screen door is wide open, then travel east, then try to travel south. Then, in the garden, lift the milk, head north, go west, and rest the milk on the stove.

In the kitchen, the user now sees a closed refrigerator, a counter, a stove, a kitchen island with a note, a closed screen door east, an open wooden door west, and exits north and south. The next task after entering the kitchen was to double-check the screen door is open. But in the current state, the screen door is closed. So the user needs to open it.

Wait, the user's last action was going east into the kitchen. The prompt says to double-check the screen door is wide open. So the next action should be to open the screen door. But the user might not have done that yet. Let me check the previous steps again.

The original instructions said: After opening the wooden door, go east. Then, doublecheck that the screen door is wide open. So after going east into the kitchen, the screen door (leading east) is closed. So the user needs to open it. Then, after that, travel east again. But in the current state, the screen door is closed. So the next action should be to open the screen door.

But the user is in the kitchen now. The screen door is leading east. So the command would be "open screen door" or "open door east". However, in the game's context, the screen door is described as closed. So the correct action here is to open it. Then, after that, the user can go east again.

So the next command should be "open screen door".

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Garden, and they need to lift the milk from the floor. Previous attempts to pick up the milk didn't work. The game says "You can't see any such thing." So maybe the milk isn't on the floor anymore or the command is incorrect.

Wait, the user tried "lift milk from floor", then "pick up milk from floor", then "take milk from floor". Each time, the game didn't recognize it. The correct command might be "take milk" or "pick up milk" without specifying the floor. But the game's response says the milk is on the floor. Maybe the correct command is "take milk" or "pick up milk".

Alternatively, maybe the milk is in a different location. Let me check the game description again. The garden has a milk, half a bag of chips, lettuce, and a shovel on the floor. So the milk is indeed on the floor. The user needs to pick it up. The previous commands didn't work, so maybe the correct verb is "take" or "pick up". Since "take milk" is a possible command, maybe that's the right one. Let's try "take milk".

<think>
Okay, let's recap the user's progress so far. The main goal was to follow a series of steps to reach the original goal, which seems to involve navigating through different rooms, opening doors, retrieving items, and interacting with objects.

Starting in the bedroom, the user opened the antique trunk, took the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, then went east to the kitchen. In the kitchen, they opened the screen door, went east to the backyard, then tried to go east again but couldn't, so they went south to the garden. In the garden, they picked up the milk, then tried to go north but got redirected back to the backyard. Then they went west to the kitchen again, and now they're in the bathroom.

The next step according to the original task was after picking up the milk, head north, then go west. But in the current scenario, after picking up the milk, the user went north from the garden, which led them to the backyard, then west to the kitchen, and now to the bathroom. The user is now in the bathroom, and the next action should be to go south back to the kitchen. But the original task mentioned after stealing the milk, head north, then attempt to travel west. However, the user might have deviated from the path. 

But considering the current location in the bathroom, the exit to the south is unblocked. So the correct next step would be to go south back to the kitchen. However, the user's last action was going north from the garden, which led to the backyard, then west to the kitchen, then to the bathroom. Now, in the bathroom, the exit to the south is available. So the user should go south to return to the kitchen. But the original task might have a different sequence. However, based on the current game state, the next logical step is to go south from the bathroom back to the kitchen. But the user's goal was to rest the milk on the stove. The stove is in the kitchen. So after getting the milk, they need to go back to the kitchen, then put the milk on the stove. 

But the user is currently in the bathroom. So the next action should be to go south to the kitchen. However, the user's last command was "go north" which led them to the bathroom. So the next step is to go south from the bathroom. But the user's task was to head north after picking up the milk, but that led them away. Maybe there's a mistake in the path. However, the game's current state requires the user to proceed from the bathroom. The correct next action would be to go south back to the kitchen. But the user's original task might have a different sequence. However, based on the game's current state, the next action is to go south. But the user's last action was "go north" which led them to the bathroom. So the next step is to go south from the bathroom. But the user's task was to head north after picking up the milk, which might have been a misstep. However, the game's current state requires the user to proceed from the bathroom. Therefore, the correct next action is to go south to the kitchen. But the user's previous steps might have led them away from the original path. However, the game's current state is in the bathroom, and the exit to the south is available. So the next action is to go south.
