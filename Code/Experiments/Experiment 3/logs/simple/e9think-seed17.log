Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, you could, like, ensure that the chest drawer is open. And then, take the old key from the chest drawer inside the bedroom. With the old key, doublecheck that the wooden door is unlocked. And then, open the wooden door within the bedroom. Then, attempt to go east. Then, make absolutely sure that the screen door inside the kitchen is opened. And then, attempt to venture east. Next, travel south. And then, lift the half of a bag of chips from the floor of the garden. Then, make an effort to move north. If you can finish that, venture west. And then, rest the half of a bag of chips on the stove. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Bedroom =-
You've just sauntered into a bedroom. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

You can see a chest drawer. You can see an antique trunk. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You see a king-size bed. The king-size bed is usual. The king-size bed appears to be empty.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

You see a set of chairs. The set of chairs appears to be empty. You move on, clearly depressed by your TextWorld experience. You see a bbq. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a patio table. The patio table is normal. But the thing is empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the patio table.

There is an open screen door leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

There is an apple, a lettuce, a half of a bag of chips and a shovel on the floor.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in the Garden scene. The goal is to lift the half of a bag of chips from the floor and put it on the stove. So far, they've made it to the garden. The current items on the floor are an apple, lettuce, half a bag of chips, and a shovel.

The next step according to the task is to lift the half of the bag of chips. So the user needs to pick it up. Then, they have to move north and then west to reach the kitchen or another area where the stove is. Wait, the previous steps were going south from the backyard to the garden. Now, in the garden, the user needs to take the chips. Once they have it, they need to move north (which would take them back to the backyard or kitchen?), then west to the kitchen, and then put the chips on the stove.

But the current location is the garden. The user's next action should be to take the half of the bag of chips. So the command would be "take half of a bag of chips from floor" or something similar. But in the game's context, the correct command is "take half of a bag of chips". The game might require the exact phrasing. Let me check the previous interactions. The user was told to "lift the half of a bag of chips from the floor of the garden." So the correct command is "take half of a bag of chips".

After taking it, the user needs to move north to get back to the backyard, then west to the kitchen, and then put the chips on the stove. But the user's next action is to take the chips. So the answer should be "take half of a bag of chips".
