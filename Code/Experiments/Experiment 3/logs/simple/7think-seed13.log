I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is how to play! First, it would be great if you could ensure that the chest drawer within the bedroom is open. And then, retrieve the old key from the chest drawer. And then, unlock the wooden door with the old key. And then, ensure that the wooden door within the bedroom is open. And then, make an attempt to go east. And then, open the screen door. After opening the screen door, make an effort to go to the east. Then, take a trip south. And then, retrieve the bell pepper from the floor of the garden. If you can get your hands on the bell pepper, head north. Then, travel west. After that, rest the bell pepper on the stove. Got that? Good!

-= Bedroom =-
You're now in the bedroom. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You can make out a chest drawer. You can see a closed antique trunk. You make out a king-size bed. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Hm. Oh well

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

You can see a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this TextWorld game and has followed a set of instructions. They've opened the chest drawer, retrieved the old key, unlocked the wooden door, opened it, and then went east into the kitchen. The current location is the kitchen, and they've just made it to step 5 out of 6. The next step in their original plan was to open the screen door, then go east again, then south, retrieve the bell pepper from the garden, head north, travel west, and rest the bell pepper on the stove.

But in the kitchen, there's a screen door leading east that's closed. The user's next action should be to open that screen door. The previous steps had them open the wooden door in the bedroom, so following the same pattern, opening the screen door makes sense. After opening it, they can try going east again. The user's next command should be "open screen door" to proceed.

But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You swear loudly. You can see a patio table. Now why would someone leave that there? But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in the TextWorld game. They've successfully opened the chest drawer, retrieved the key, unlocked the door, and moved through the kitchen and backyard. Now they're in the garden, where they need to retrieve the bell pepper from the floor, put it on the stove, and then proceed.

The problem is that the user tried to take the bell pepper from the floor multiple times, but the game keeps saying it can't see the bell pepper. Then they tried to put it on the stove, but that also didn't work. The user is confused and needs to figure out what's wrong.

First, I need to check the current state of the garden. The description says there's a half of a bag of chips, an apple, a bell pepper, and a shovel on the floor. So the bell pepper is indeed there. But when the user tried to take it, the game didn't recognize it. Maybe the correct command is different. Instead of "take bell pepper from floor," maybe it's just "take bell pepper" since the bell pepper is on the floor. The game might automatically assume that if you take the bell pepper, it's from the floor.

Then, after taking the bell pepper, the next step is to put it on the stove. The user tried "put bell pepper on stove," but the stove is in the kitchen, and they're in the garden. Wait, the user moved south from the backyard to the garden. The stove is in the kitchen, which is north of the garden. So maybe they need to go back to the kitchen first, take the bell pepper, and then put it on the stove. But the user's previous actions were in the garden. So perhaps the correct sequence is: take the bell pepper from the floor (but the game doesn't recognize it), then go north to the kitchen, then put it on the stove.

Alternatively, maybe the user is in the garden, and the stove is not present here. The description of the garden says there's a half of a bag of chips, an apple, a bell pepper, and a shovel on the floor. The stove is in the kitchen. So the user needs to go back to the kitchen to put the bell pepper on the stove. But the user is in the garden, so they need to go north to the kitchen. Then, once in the kitchen, they can put the bell pepper on the stove.

But the user's last action was in the garden, trying to take the bell pepper. Since the game didn't recognize it, maybe the correct command is just "take bell pepper" without specifying the floor. Then, after taking it, go north to the kitchen, then "put bell pepper on stove."

So the next step would be to take the bell pepper, then go north to the kitchen, then put it on the stove. But the user is currently in the garden, so the next action should be to take the bell pepper. If that fails, maybe the user needs to check if the bell pepper is actually there. But according to the description, it is. So the correct command is "take bell pepper," then proceed to the kitchen.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they need to follow a series of steps to complete objectives. So far, they've managed to open the chest drawer, get the old key, unlock the door, open the wooden door, go east, open the screen door, go east again, go south, retrieve the bell pepper, and then go north. But they're stuck in a loop between the Kitchen and Bathroom, going back and forth.

The original goal was to retrieve the bell pepper, put it on the stove, and maybe other steps. But the user has already taken the bell pepper and put it on the stove? Wait, no, in the Garden, they tried to take the bell pepper but couldn't see it. Then they tried putting it on the stove, but the stove was in the Kitchen. So maybe the user needs to go back to the Kitchen and use the stove.

But the current state is that they're in the Kitchen again, and the stove is there. The user has the bell pepper. So the next step should be to use the stove. But in the Garden, after taking the bell pepper, they went north to Backyard, then west to Kitchen. Now they're in the Kitchen again. The stove is in the Kitchen. So the user needs to put the bell pepper on the stove. But in the Garden, they tried to put it on the stove but couldn't see it. Maybe the stove is in the Kitchen, so they need to go to the Kitchen and put it there.

Wait, the user is currently in the Kitchen. They have the bell pepper. So the next action should be to put the bell pepper on the stove. But the previous attempt to put it on the stove failed because they were in the Garden. Now they're in the Kitchen, so they can do that. So the correct command is "put bell pepper on stove".
