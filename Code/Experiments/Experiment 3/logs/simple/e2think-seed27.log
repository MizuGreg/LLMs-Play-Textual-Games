Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. Your first objective is to look and see that the antique trunk is open. After that, pick up the old key from the antique trunk in the bedroom. After that, insert the old key into the wooden door inside the bedroom's lock to unlock it. And then, ensure that the wooden door in the bedroom is open. After that, travel east. Okay, and then, doublecheck that the refrigerator is ajar. Then, take the milk from the refrigerator. Then, place the milk on the stove inside the kitchen. That's it!

-= Bedroom =-
You arrive in a bedroom. A standard kind of place.

You can make out a closed chest drawer. You can see an antique trunk. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a king-size bed. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me see. The user is in a text-based game where they need to follow a series of steps. So far, they've opened the antique trunk and found an old key. The next step according to the initial instructions was to pick up the key. But wait, the user just opened the trunk and the key was revealed. The next logical step would be to take the key from the trunk.

Wait, the user's last action was opening the trunk, and the game responded that the key was inside. Now, the user needs to pick up the key. But the prompt says to only output the action, like "go north". So the correct next command here would be to take the old key from the trunk. Let me check the previous steps again. The original plan was: open the trunk, pick up the key, then insert it into the door. So after opening the trunk and finding the key, the next step is to pick it up. The user hasn't done that yet. So the next action should be "take old key" or "pick up old key". But in the game's context, the exact command might be "take old key from antique trunk". However, the user's previous actions were "look at antique trunk" and "open antique trunk". The game's response after opening showed the key is there. So the next step is to take the key. The correct command here would be "take old key". But I need to make sure that's the right syntax. Since the user is in the bedroom, and the key is in the trunk, the command would be "take old key from antique trunk". But maybe the game expects just "take old key". Alternatively, maybe "pick up old key". But the user's previous actions were "look at antique trunk" and "open antique trunk", so perhaps the next step is to take the key. The user's last message was the game's response after opening the trunk, and the user is expected to input the next action. So the correct next command is "take old key".

Okay, let me figure this out. The user tried to insert the old key into the wooden door, but the game said "That can't contain things." So maybe the key isn't meant to be inserted into the door directly. Let me check the previous steps again.

The original plan was: after picking up the key, insert it into the wooden door inside the bedroom's lock to unlock it. But the user tried to insert it into the door, which might not be the right place. Maybe the door has a lock, and the key needs to be in the lock. Alternatively, perhaps the key is for a different lock. Wait, the user is in the bedroom, and there's a closed wooden door leading east. Maybe the door is locked, and the key needs to be in the lock to open it. But the game's response said "That can't contain things," which suggests that inserting the key into the door isn't the correct action. Maybe the key should be placed in the lock of the door. Alternatively, maybe the door is a separate object. Let me think again.

The user has the key, and the next step was to insert it into the door's lock. But the game's response indicates that the action is invalid. Perhaps the correct action is to use the key on the door, like "use old key on wooden door" or "unlock wooden door with old key". Alternatively, maybe the door is locked, and the key needs to be in the lock. Since the user can't insert it into the door, maybe they need to find the lock mechanism. But the game's message says "That can't contain things," which might mean that the key can't be inserted into the door as a whole. So perhaps the correct action is to try to open the door with the key. Alternatively, maybe the key is for a different object. Wait, the original instruction said to insert the key into the wooden door inside the bedroom's lock. So maybe the door has a lock, and the key needs to be in the lock. But the user tried to insert it into the door, which might not be the right place. The correct action might be to "unlock wooden door" using the key. But the game's response indicates that the previous action was invalid. So the next step should be to try a different command, like "unlock wooden door" or "open wooden door with old key". However, the user's previous action was "insert old key into wooden door", which failed. So the next possible action is to try using the key on the door's lock. Maybe the correct command is "use old key on wooden door" or "unlock wooden door". Since the game's response was "That can't contain things," perhaps the key needs to be placed in the lock. So the next action should be to try to unlock the door with the key. Therefore, the correct command would be "unlock wooden door" or "use old key on wooden door". But the user needs to input the exact command. Since the previous action was "insert old key into wooden door", which didn't work, the next step is to try a different action. Maybe "unlock wooden door" is the correct command. Alternatively, "open wooden door with old key". But the game might expect "use old key on wooden door". However, the user's previous action was "insert old key into wooden door", which was invalid. So the next action should be to try "unlock wooden door" or "use old key on wooden door". Given the game's context, the correct next action is likely "unlock wooden door".

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me figure this out. The user tried to go east but the game said they have to open the wooden door first. So the previous action was "go east", which wasn't allowed because the door was still closed. The user already unlocked the door with the key, so now the door should be open. Wait, maybe the game's message is confusing. The user unlocked the door, so they should be able to go east. But the game says they have to open the door first. Maybe the door is locked again? Or maybe the command to open it wasn't successful. Let me check the previous steps.

The user inserted the key into the door, which worked, and the game said "You unlock wooden door." So the door should be open. Then the next step was to go east. But the game says "You have to open the wooden door first." That's contradictory. Maybe the game considers the door as closed even after unlocking? Or maybe the user needs to open it again. Alternatively, maybe the door is locked from the other side. Wait, the user is in the bedroom, and the door leads east. After unlocking, the door should be open. So the correct action is to go east. But the game is preventing it. Maybe the user needs to open the door again. But why? Maybe the game's message is a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the door is not open yet. Let me think again. The user unlocked the door, so it should be open. The next step is to go east. The game's message is confusing. But according to the game's response, the user has to open the door first, which is already unlocked. Maybe the user needs to open it again. So the correct action is to open the door again. But the user already did that. Hmm. Maybe the game is expecting the user to go east after opening the door. So the next action is "go east".

Okay, let me see. The user is in a text-based game where they need to follow specific steps. So far, they've opened the antique trunk, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door, and tried to go east but were told they had to open the door first. Then they opened the door again, and now the score is up.

The next step according to the original plan was to travel east after ensuring the door is open. The user just opened the door again, so the next logical action is to go east. The game might have been confused before, but now the door is open. So the correct command is "go east".

Okay, the user tried to type "thouse south" but the game said that's not a recognized verb. Let me figure out what the correct command should be. The user is in the kitchen, and the previous action was going east from the bedroom, which led them to the kitchen. Now, in the kitchen, the description mentions an exit to the north and a note on the kitchen island. The user's goal was to double-check the refrigerator is ajar, take the milk, place it on the stove. But the current prompt says "You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south." Wait, the kitchen has a closed screen door leading east, an open wooden door west, and an exit to the north. The user might have been trying to go south, but that's not listed. Maybe the correct direction is north. The user's previous command was "go east", which worked, but now they need to go north. The game's message says "You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south." But maybe that's a mistake. The available exits are north and west. The user might have meant "go north" instead of "thouse south". So the correct command is "go north".

Okay, let's see. The user is in the kitchen again after going south from the bathroom. The goal was to double-check the refrigerator is ajar, take the milk, and place it on the stove. The user hasn't done those steps yet. The current location is the kitchen, which is part of the house. The previous actions involved opening the trunk, getting the key, unlocking the door, and navigating through the house. Now, the user needs to focus on the refrigerator and the milk. The game's message mentions the refrigerator is in the corner, so the next step should be to check if it's open. The user needs to "doublecheck that the refrigerator is ajar" as per the original instructions. So the correct command here is to look at the refrigerator or open it. Since the user hasn't checked it yet, the next action should be to check the refrigerator's status. The command would be "look at refrigerator" or "open refrigerator". But the game might expect "check refrigerator" or "examine refrigerator". However, the user's previous actions used commands like "look at antique trunk" and "open antique trunk", so maybe "look at refrigerator" is the right command here. Alternatively, since the user needs to double-check if it's ajar, maybe "open refrigerator" if it's closed. But the game might have the refrigerator already open or closed. The user needs to confirm its state. So the next action is to look at the refrigerator to check if it's open.
