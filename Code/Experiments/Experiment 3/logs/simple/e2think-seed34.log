It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First step, open the chest drawer within the bedroom. And then, take the old key from the chest drawer in the bedroom. If you can get your hands on the old key, insert the old key into the wooden door's lock to unlock it. Then, ensure that the wooden door is open. After that, travel east. Then, open the screen door. Then, go to the east. Then, attempt to travel south. If you can manage that, lift the lettuce from the floor of the garden. And then, head north. Then, try to travel west. Following that, rest the lettuce on the stove. That's it!

-= Bedroom =-
Okay, so you're in a bedroom, cool, but is it standard? You better believe it is.

Hey, want to see a chest drawer? Look over there, a chest drawer. Oh, great. Here's an antique trunk. You see a king-size bed. The king-size bed is typical. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps in the TextWorld game. They started in the bedroom, opened the chest drawer, took the old key, and now they're at the bedroom again with a score of 2/3. The next step according to the initial instructions was to insert the old key into the wooden door's lock to unlock it. 

Wait, the user hasn't done that yet. The current location is the bedroom, and there's a closed wooden door leading east. So the next logical step would be to use the old key on the door. The user has the key, so they should try to unlock the door.

But the user's last action was taking the key, and the next prompt is asking if they're on the right track. The user is supposed to respond with the next command. The correct next action would be to go to the wooden door and unlock it. But in the game's context, maybe the command is "use old key on wooden door" or "unlock wooden door". However, the game's commands might be more straightforward. Since the door is closed and the key is in hand, the player needs to try to unlock it. 

Looking back at the initial instructions, after taking the key, the next step was to "insert the old key into the wooden door's lock to unlock it." So the action here would be to unlock the door. But the exact command might be "unlock wooden door" or "use key on door". However, in TextWorld, the correct command might be "unlock door" if the door is the only one nearby. Alternatively, since the door is described as leading east, maybe the player needs to go to the door first. But the player is already in the bedroom, so the door is in the same room. 

So the next action should be to unlock the wooden door. The user has the key, so they should try to unlock it. The correct command would be "unlock wooden door" or "unlock door". Since the door is closed, the player needs to use the key on it. Therefore, the next step is to unlock the door with the old key.

Okay, let's see. The user tried to go east but the game said they have to open the wooden door first. So the previous action was unlocking the door, which increased the score to 3/4. Now, the user is in the bedroom again, and the next step is to open the wooden door. Wait, but they just unlocked it. Maybe the game considers the door as closed until opened. Wait, the user had the key, unlocked the door, but maybe the door is still closed and needs to be opened. Or maybe the action "unlock" is different from "open". Let me check the previous steps.

Initially, the door was closed. The user had the key, unlocked it, and then the game said "You unlock wooden door." So maybe the door is now unlocked but not open. So the next step is to open it. The user's last action was "go east", but the game prevented that and said the door needs to be opened first. So the correct next action is to open the wooden door. The user needs to open it after unlocking. So the next command should be "open wooden door".

Oh well Were you looking for a kitchen island? Because look over there, it's a kitchen island. On the kitchen island you can see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Kitchen now. The previous steps were unlocking and opening the wooden door to get here. The goal was to eventually get the lettuce in the garden and then do some actions. The current room is the Kitchen. The next step according to the initial instructions was after opening the screen door and going east, then trying to travel south to the garden. But the user is in the Kitchen now. Let me check the original plan again.

Original steps: After unlocking the door and going east (which led to the kitchen), the next steps were to open the screen door, go east, attempt to travel south. But in the kitchen, there's a closed screen door leading east. So maybe the next action is to open the screen door. But the user is in the kitchen, and the screen door is closed. So the correct command would be "open screen door". But the user's last action was "go east", which might have been prevented because the door was closed. Wait, in the previous step, after opening the wooden door (the one from the bedroom), the user tried to go east, which led to the kitchen. Now, in the kitchen, there's a closed screen door east. So the next step is to open that screen door. The user needs to open it before proceeding. So the next action should be "open screen door".

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Backyard now. The previous steps involved opening the screen door in the kitchen, which led here. The original plan was to go east, then attempt to travel south to the garden to lift the lettuce. But the current room is the Backyard. The user needs to go south to reach the garden. The Backyard has an open screen door west and a path south. So the next action should be to go south. The user's last action was "go east", which led to the Backyard. Now, the next step is to go south to the garden. So the command is "go south".

Okay, the user tried to "lift lettuce from floor" but the game said that's not a recognized verb. So I need to figure out the correct command. In TextWorld, commands are usually verbs like "take", "pick up", "get", etc. The lettuce is on the floor, so the correct action would be "take lettuce" or "pick up lettuce". The user probably meant "lift", but the game doesn't recognize that. So the next step is to use the correct verb. Let me check the previous interactions. The user had to "take old key from chest drawer" before, so maybe "take" is the correct verb here. Therefore, the next action should be "take lettuce".

Okay, the user is trying to take the lettuce from the floor in the garden, but the game says they can't see it. Let me check the previous messages. The user was told that in the garden, there's a milk, a lettuce, a half of a bag of chips, and a shovel on the floor. So the lettuce is present. Maybe the command needs to be more specific. The user tried "take lettuce from floor" and "take lettuce from floor" again. Maybe the correct command is just "take lettuce" without specifying the floor, since the lettuce is on the floor by default. Alternatively, maybe the game expects "pick up lettuce" instead of "take". Let me think about possible valid commands. In TextWorld, common verbs are "take", "get", "pick up". The user might need to use "take lettuce" or "pick up lettuce". Since the user previously used "take old key from chest drawer", maybe the correct command here is "take lettuce". Let me try that.

Okay, the user tried to "rest lettuce on stove" but the game said that's not a recognized verb. So I need to figure out the correct command. The previous action was taking the lettuce, and now they need to rest it on the stove. The correct verb here might be "put" instead of "rest". In TextWorld, "put" is a common verb for placing items. So the command should be "put lettuce on stove". Let me check if that's the right syntax. The user had to "take" the lettuce, so "put" would be the opposite action. Therefore, the next action is "put lettuce on stove".

The stove is in the kitchen, but they're in the garden now. Wait, maybe the stove is in the kitchen, so the user needs to go back to the kitchen first. The user is in the garden, so they need to go west through the screen door to the kitchen, then find the stove. But the current room is the garden. The user's last action was "put lettuce on stove", which isn't possible because the stove isn't here. So the correct next step is to go back to the kitchen. The garden has an exit north to the kitchen, but the user needs to go west through the screen door. Wait, the garden's description says there's an unguarded exit south, but the user is already in the garden. Maybe the user needs to go north to the kitchen. Let me check the garden's description again. The garden says "You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north."

Okay, the user tried to "go west" but the game said that's not a recognized verb. Wait, no, the user just said "go west" as the command. But in the previous step, after going north to the backyard, the user is in the Backyard. The Backyard has a screen door leading west. So the correct command should be "go west" to return to the kitchen. But the game says that's not a recognized verb. Maybe the correct verb is "open screen door" again, but the screen door is already open. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use "go" followed by the direction, but the game expects "go west" as a valid command. Wait, the user's last action was "go north", which worked. Now, in the Backyard, the screen door is open west. So the next step is to go west. But the game says "That's not a verb I recognise." Hmm, maybe the correct command is "go west" but the game doesn't accept it. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use "go" followed by the direction. Wait, the user just said "go west" and the game rejected it. Maybe the correct command is "go to west" or "move west". But in TextWorld, the standard command is "go [direction]". So perhaps the user should try "go west" again. But the game says it's not recognized. Maybe the user needs to use "open screen door" again, but the door is already open. Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go south from the Backyard. The Backyard's description says "try going south, that entranceway is unblocked." So maybe the correct command is "go south" instead of west. But the user's goal was to get to the kitchen. Wait, the user is in the Backyard, which is connected to the Kitchen via the screen door west. So going west would take them back to the Kitchen. But the game says "go west" is not a verb. Maybe the correct command is "go to kitchen" or "go west". But the game might expect "go west" as the command. Since the user tried "go west" and it was rejected, maybe the correct action is to go south to the garden again. But that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use "exit south" since the Backyard has an unguarded exit south. But the user's goal was to get to the kitchen. This is confusing. The user needs to find the correct command to proceed. Since the user is in the Backyard, and the screen door is west, the correct command should be "go west" to return to the Kitchen. Even though the game says it's not recognized, maybe the user should try again. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use "open screen door" again, but it's already open. The user's previous action was "go north" which worked, so maybe "go west" is the correct next step. The game might have a typo or the user's input is being misinterpreted. So the next action is "go west".

-= Kitchen =-
Look at that placard! What does it say? It says Welcome to the kitchen? Well that's cool. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You can see a closed refrigerator close by. You can make out a counter. The counter is typical. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You see a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well Were you looking for a kitchen island? Because look over there, it's a kitchen island. On the kitchen island you can see a note.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, the user is in the Kitchen now after going west from the Backyard. The previous steps involved navigating through the rooms, picking up the lettuce, and now they need to rest it on the stove. But the user is in the Kitchen, so the stove is here. The correct command would be to "put lettuce on stove". However, the user might have the lettuce in their inventory. Since they previously took the lettuce from the garden, they should be holding it. So the next action is to put it on the stove. The command should be "put lettuce on stove".
