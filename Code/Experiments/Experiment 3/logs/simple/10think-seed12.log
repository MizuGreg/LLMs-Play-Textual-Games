I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First off, ensure that the antique trunk within the bedroom is open. After that, recover the old key from the antique trunk. After that, make it so that the wooden door in the bedroom is unlocked with the old key. And then, make absolutely sure that the wooden door inside the bedroom is ajar. After opening the wooden door, go east. Then, doublecheck that the screen door is wide open. And then, attempt to travel east. And then, try to travel south. With that done, lift the milk from the floor of the garden. After stealing the milk, head north. And then, attempt to travel west. With that done, rest the milk on the stove. That's it!

-= Bedroom =-
I am sorry to announce that you are now in the bedroom. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a chest drawer. You scan the room for an antique trunk, and you find an antique trunk. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to a king-size bed. The king-size bed is standard. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. You think about smashing the king-size bed to bits, throwing the bits in the dump, etc, until you get bored.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Of every kitchen you could have sauntered into, you had to walk into an ordinary one. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You can see a closed refrigerator in the room. You can make out a counter. The counter is usual. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. You scan the room, seeing a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. You can see a kitchen island. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? On the kitchen island you can see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they have to follow a series of steps to complete a task. The current scenario is in the Backyard. The user has already done several actions: opened the antique trunk, taken the key, unlocked the door, opened the door, went east to the Kitchen, checked the screen door, opened it, and went east again to the Backyard.

Now, the user is asked if they think they're making the right actions and if they're close to the goal. The next step mentioned in the original task was after opening the screen door and going east, then trying to travel south. But in the current state, they're in the Backyard. The next step in the original instructions was to "attempt to travel south" after going east from the kitchen. However, in the Backyard, there's an exit to the south that's unguarded. So the next logical step would be to go south from the Backyard. But the user needs to check if that's the correct next move according to the task.

Wait, the original task said after opening the screen door and going east (to the Backyard), then try to travel south. So from the Backyard, the user can go south. The Backyard's description says there's an unguarded exit to the south. So the correct action here is to go south. The user's next move should be "go south".

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, the user is stuck in the Garden scene. They tried to take the milk from the floor multiple times, but the game keeps saying it's not visible. Let me check the previous messages.

In the Garden description, it says: "There is a milk, a half of a bag of chips, a lettuce and a shovel on the floor." Wait, the user is trying to take "milk from floor", but maybe the correct command is "take milk" without specifying the floor. The game might be interpreting "from floor" as a direction or a location, but the milk is already on the floor. Alternatively, maybe the correct verb is "take milk" instead of "take milk from floor". 

Looking at the previous interaction, when the user tried "take milk from floor", the game responded with "You can't see any such thing." But according to the description, the milk is on the floor. So perhaps the correct command is just "take milk". Let me check if the game allows that. The user might have been using the wrong phrasing. The correct action is to take the milk directly, not specifying the floor since it's already on the floor. So the next action should be "take milk".

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in a loop between the Kitchen and Bathroom, going back and forth. The original goal was to complete a series of tasks, but it seems like the game is stuck in a cycle. The user has already completed the initial tasks: opening the trunk, getting the key, unlocking the door, opening it, and moving east. Then they tried to go south in the Garden but couldn't find the milk. After some retries, they finally took the milk and went north, but now they're looping between Kitchen and Bathroom.

The user's current action is to go north from the Kitchen to the Bathroom, then back to the Kitchen again. This suggests that the game might have a loop or the user is not progressing towards the final goal. The original goal mentioned resting the milk on the stove, but the user hasn't done that yet. However, the user is now stuck in a loop without making progress towards the final steps.

The user might need to find a way to exit the loop and proceed to the next steps. Since the user is in the Kitchen, maybe they need to check the kitchen island for the note mentioned earlier. Alternatively, they might need to go east through the screen door to continue their journey. But the user has been going north and south between the Kitchen and Bathroom, which doesn't seem to be part of the original plan.

The correct next step should be to check the kitchen island for the note, but the user hasn't done that yet. Alternatively, they might need to go east from the Kitchen through the screen door to continue moving towards the Garden or other areas. However, the user's last action was going north, leading them back to the Bathroom. So, the next action should be to go south from the Bathroom back to the Kitchen and then proceed east through the screen door to continue their journey. But the user is stuck in a loop, so they need to break free from that cycle and focus on the remaining tasks, like resting the milk on the stove.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in a loop between the Kitchen and Bathroom, going back and forth. The original goal was to lift the milk from the garden, then head north, then west, then rest the milk on the stove. But the user kept going north and south, ending up in the bathroom again.

Wait, the milk was taken from the garden, but the user hasn't placed it on the stove yet. The current location is the Kitchen. The stove is in the Kitchen, right? So the next step should be to go to the stove and put the milk there. But the user is stuck in a loop between Kitchen and Bathroom. Maybe they need to go back to the Garden again to rest the milk on the stove. But how?

Wait, the user was in the Garden earlier, took the milk, then went north to Backyard, then to Kitchen, then Bathroom, and back. So maybe the user needs to go back to the Garden from the Kitchen. But how? The Kitchen has an exit to the south, which was the Garden. Wait, no, earlier when the user was in the Garden, the exit to the south was unguarded. But now, after moving around, maybe the path is blocked. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go from Kitchen to Backyard again, then to Garden.

But the user is currently in the Kitchen. The Kitchen has an open screen door leading east (to Backyard) and an open wooden door leading west (to Bathroom). So from Kitchen, going east to Backyard, then from Backyard, going south to Garden. Then rest the milk on the stove. But the user hasn't done that yet. The original task was to rest the milk on the stove after stealing it. So the next action should be to go back to the Garden, then to the stove. But how to get there from the current position?

Current location is Kitchen. So the user needs to go east to Backyard, then south to Garden. Then, in the Garden, there's a stove? Wait, in the Garden description, there's a milk, chips, lettuce, and shovel on the floor. But the stove was in the Kitchen. So maybe the user is supposed to go back to the Kitchen, then go to the stove. But the user is in the Kitchen now. Wait, the user has the milk. So in the Kitchen, the stove is present. So the user should go to the stove and put the milk there. But the user hasn't done that yet. The original instructions said: "rest the milk on the stove." So the user needs to go to the stove and place the milk there.

But in the current Kitchen description, the stove is mentioned as "there isn't a thing on it." So the user can go to the stove and put the milk there. So the next action should be to go to the stove. But how? The user is in the Kitchen. The stove is in the Kitchen. So the user needs to go to the stove. But the commands available are directions. Wait, the user is in the Kitchen, and the stove is part of the room. So maybe the user can just "go to stove" or "go to the stove". But the game might require using the correct command. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go to the kitchen island, where the note is, but that's not relevant. The user has the milk, so they need to go to the stove and rest it there.

But the user is in the Kitchen. So the next step is to go to the stove. But the game's commands might require the user to use "go to stove" or "go to the stove". However, in previous interactions, the user used "go east", "go west", etc. So maybe the correct command is "go to stove" or "go to the stove". But the user has to use the exact command. Alternatively, maybe the stove is in the room, so the user can just "go to stove" or "go to the stove". But the game might not recognize that. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go to the kitchen island, but that's where the note is. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go to the stove directly. But since the user is in the Kitchen, and the stove is in the same room, the command would be "go to stove". However, the game might not accept that. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go to the stove by using the correct verb. But the user has to use the correct command. Since the user is in the Kitchen, and the stove is present, the next action should be to go to the stove. But the user is in the Kitchen, so maybe the command is "go to stove" or "go to the stove". However, in the previous steps, the user was told to "go east" or "go west", so maybe the correct command here is "go to stove".

But the user is in the Kitchen, and the stove is in the same room. So the user can just "go to stove" or "go to the stove". However, the game might not recognize that. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use "go to the stove" as the command. So the next action is "go to the stove".

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Kitchen and Bathroom, going back and forth. The original goal was to lift the milk from the garden, rest it on the stove, and complete the tasks. But the user kept going north and south, ending up in the bathroom again.

Wait, the milk was in the garden, but the user didn't find it. They tried taking milk from the floor in the garden but couldn't see it. Maybe the milk is still there, but the user didn't check properly. Or maybe the user didn't rest the milk on the stove yet.

Looking at the current state: the user is in the Kitchen again, but the milk was taken from the garden. Wait, the user took the milk but then kept going back and forth. The task was to rest the milk on the stove. The user hasn't done that yet. So the next step should be to go back to the garden, rest the milk on the stove, and then maybe exit.

But the user is currently in the Kitchen. The stove is in the Kitchen. So the user needs to go to the stove, rest the milk there. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the correct action is to go to the stove and rest the milk. However, the user might have already done that. Wait, the last action was going north to the bathroom, so the user is in the bathroom again. Need to go back to the kitchen, then to the stove.

But the user is in the bathroom, so the next step is to go south back to the kitchen. Then, go to the stove and rest the milk. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next command should be go south to the kitchen, then go to the stove. But the user is in the bathroom, so the immediate next action is go south.

-= Kitchen =-
Of every kitchen you could have sauntered into, you had to walk into an ordinary one. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You can see a closed refrigerator in the room. You can make out a counter. The counter is usual. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. You scan the room, seeing a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. You can see a kitchen island. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? On the kitchen island you can see a note.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out what's going on here. The user is in a text-based game where they have to follow a series of steps to complete a task. The main goal seems to be retrieving the milk from the garden and then resting it on the stove. 

Looking at the current state, the user has been moving around different rooms like the bedroom, kitchen, backyard, and bathroom. They've already opened the antique trunk, found the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, and moved east to the kitchen. Then they went to the garden, tried to take the milk but couldn't see it, and eventually succeeded. Now they have the milk and need to rest it on the stove.

But wait, the user is currently in the bathroom, which seems to be a loop. They keep going back and forth between the kitchen and bathroom. The last action was going north from the kitchen to the bathroom, and now they're back in the kitchen again. The score is at 9/49, which suggests there are still steps left to complete.

The original task mentioned resting the milk on the stove. The user has the milk, so they need to go to the stove. However, in the current room (kitchen), there's a stove mentioned, but it's empty. The user needs to rest the milk there. But the user is stuck in a loop between the kitchen and bathroom, not progressing further.

Maybe the issue is that the user hasn't yet reached the stove in the kitchen. They need to go from the bathroom back to the kitchen, then find the stove and rest the milk. But the previous attempts to go north from the kitchen led to the bathroom, and going south brings them back. So the correct path is to go from the kitchen to the bathroom, then back to the kitchen, then to the stove.

But in the current state, the user is in the kitchen again. The stove is in the kitchen, so they should be able to rest the milk there. However, the user might not have noticed that the stove is in the kitchen. The instruction says to rest the milk on the stove, so the next step is to go to the stove and do that.

But the user's last action was going north to the bathroom, then south back to the kitchen. Now they are in the kitchen again. The stove is in the kitchen, so they can rest the milk there. The command should be to rest the milk on the stove. However, the game might require the user to first go to the stove's location, but since they're already in the kitchen, they can directly rest it.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check the kitchen island or other objects for the stove. But according to the description, the stove is in the kitchen and is unoccupied. So the correct action is to rest the milk on the stove.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to rest the milk on the stove. But the game says "That's not a verb I recognise." So maybe the correct command is different. Let me check the previous steps.

Earlier, the user had to "rest the milk on the stove" as part of the task. But the game doesn't recognize "rest" as a verb here. Maybe the correct action is "put" instead of "rest"? Or maybe "place"?

Wait, in the initial instructions, the user was told to "rest the milk on the stove." But the game's response indicates that "rest" isn't a valid command. So perhaps the correct verb is "put" or "place". Let me think about the possible commands. In text adventures, common verbs are "take", "put", "use", "open", "close", "look", etc. So maybe "put milk on stove" is the correct command. But the user tried "rest milk on stove" which isn't recognized. So the correct command should be "put milk on stove".

But the user might have tried "rest" because the original instruction said "rest the milk". However, the game's parser might not recognize "rest" as a valid verb here. So the correct action is to use "put" instead. Therefore, the next command should be "put milk on stove".

Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game called TextWorld, and their goal is to follow a series of steps to complete a task. The current challenge is to rest the milk on the stove. But the user is having trouble because the game is saying "You can't see any such thing." 

First, I need to recall the previous steps. The user successfully opened the antique trunk, took the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, and then went east to the kitchen. They then went to the garden, tried to take the milk from the floor, but the game didn't recognize it. After several attempts, they finally took the milk. Then they went back through various rooms, but now they're in the bathroom and trying to put the milk on the stove.

Wait, the problem is that the user is in the bathroom, but the stove is in the kitchen. So maybe they need to go back to the kitchen to put the milk on the stove. The user tried to put the milk on the stove while in the bathroom, which is why the game says it's not there. 

So the correct action would be to go back to the kitchen, then put the milk on the stove. But the user is currently in the bathroom. The previous steps show that they've been moving between rooms, but they might have gotten stuck in a loop. The user needs to navigate back to the kitchen where the stove is located. 

Looking at the game's environment, the kitchen has a stove, so the user must be in the kitchen to perform that action. The user is currently in the bathroom, so they need to go south to return to the kitchen. Once there, they can put the milk on the stove. 

But the user's last action was trying to put the milk on the stove in the bathroom, which isn't possible. Therefore, the next step should be to go back to the kitchen, then put the milk on the stove. However, the user might not have the milk with them, but earlier they took it from the garden. Wait, the user took the milk from the garden, so they should have it. 

So the correct sequence is: go south from the bathroom to the kitchen, then put the milk on the stove. The user's last action was in the bathroom, so the next command should be "go south" to return to the kitchen. Then, once in the kitchen, they can "put milk on stove". But the user is in the bathroom, so the immediate next step is to go south.

-= Kitchen =-
Of every kitchen you could have sauntered into, you had to walk into an ordinary one. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You can see a closed refrigerator in the room. You can make out a counter. The counter is usual. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. You scan the room, seeing a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. You can see a kitchen island. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? On the kitchen island you can see a note.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text adventure game, and they've been following a series of steps to complete a task. The main goal seems to be to rest the milk on the stove after stealing it from the garden. 

Looking at the history, the user successfully opened the antique trunk, took the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, and then navigated through various rooms like the kitchen, backyard, and bathroom. They even managed to take the milk from the garden, but then got stuck trying to put it on the stove. The problem was that the command "rest milk on stove" wasn't recognized, and after several attempts, they tried "put milk on stove," which also didn't work.

Now, the user is in the bathroom again, and the game is at step 9/59. The task remaining is to rest the milk on the stove. Since the previous attempts to use "rest" and "put" didn't work, maybe the correct verb is "place" instead. Let me check the game's possible commands. In many text adventures, "place" is a valid verb for putting an object somewhere. So the correct command should be "place milk on stove."

But wait, in the kitchen, the stove is mentioned as being empty. The user has the milk, so they need to place it on the stove. The previous error messages indicated that "rest" and "put" weren't recognized, so "place" might be the right choice. Let me make sure there's no other possible command. Alternatively, maybe "put" is correct, but the game's parser isn't recognizing it. However, since "rest" was already tried and failed, "place" is more likely the correct verb here. So the next action should be "place milk on stove."
