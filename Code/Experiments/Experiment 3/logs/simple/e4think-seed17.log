Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, you could, like, ensure that the chest drawer is open. And then, take the old key from the chest drawer inside the bedroom. With the old key, doublecheck that the wooden door is unlocked. And then, open the wooden door within the bedroom. Then, attempt to go east. Then, make absolutely sure that the screen door inside the kitchen is opened. And then, attempt to venture east. Next, travel south. And then, lift the half of a bag of chips from the floor of the garden. Then, make an effort to move north. If you can finish that, venture west. And then, rest the half of a bag of chips on the stove. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Bedroom =-
You've just sauntered into a bedroom. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

You can see a chest drawer. You can see an antique trunk. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You see a king-size bed. The king-size bed is usual. The king-size bed appears to be empty.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text adventure game called TextWorld. The goal is to follow a series of steps to win. So far, the player has been in the bedroom. They opened the chest drawer, took the old key, unlocked the wooden door, and tried to go east. But the game said they need to open the wooden door first. Wait, they already unlocked it, right? Maybe "unlock" and "open" are different actions here. In some games, you have to unlock a door and then open it, but maybe in this game, unlocking is enough? Or maybe the door is locked and needs to be opened after being unlocked.

The user is at the bedroom, has the old key, unlocked the door, but the game says they need to open it. So the next step should be to open the door. Let me check the previous steps again. The user tried to go east, but the game said the door needs to be opened first. So maybe after unlocking, they need to open it. So the correct action here is to open the wooden door. Then they can go east.

The user's next action should be to open the door. Then go east. So the next command is "open wooden door". Then "go east". But the user is asking if they're close to the goal. So far, they've done the first few steps. The next steps involve moving to the kitchen, then garden, etc. So after opening the door, they can proceed east. So the next action is to open the door.

You arrive in a kitchen. An usual kind of place.

You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a refrigerator. Hmmm... what else, what else? You smell an intriguing smell, and follow it to a counter. The counter is standard. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You see a stove. The stove is ordinary. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is ordinary. On the kitchen island you see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

You can see a closed toilet. You can see a closed bath. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a sink. The sink is ordinary. On the sink you see a toothbrush.

You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to complete the game's objectives. So far, they've navigated through the bedroom, unlocked and opened the wooden door to go east into the kitchen. Then they went north to the bathroom and south back to the kitchen. The current score is 5/9, and the next steps according to the original task are to move east from the kitchen, then south, pick up the half-bag of chips from the garden, move north, then west, and place the chips on the stove. 

In the kitchen, the user needs to make sure the screen door is opened. The original instruction said to "make absolutely sure that the screen door inside the kitchen is opened" before venturing east. The current state in the kitchen shows the screen door is closed. So the next action should be to open the screen door. Then, after opening it, go east. That's the next step in the sequence. The user has to follow each step carefully, as the game seems to require specific actions in order. So the correct next command is to open the screen door.

You see a set of chairs. The set of chairs appears to be empty. You move on, clearly depressed by your TextWorld experience. You see a bbq. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a patio table. The patio table is normal. But the thing is empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the patio table.

There is an open screen door leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to take the half of a bag of chips from the floor in the garden. But the game says they can't see any such thing. Wait, the previous message said there's an apple, lettuce, half of a bag of chips, and a shovel on the floor. So maybe the item is there but not visible? Or maybe the command is incorrect.

The user tried "take half of a bag of chips from floor" but got a negative response. Maybe the correct command is just "take half of a bag of chips" without specifying the floor. Or perhaps the item is named differently. Let me check the exact wording from the game's description. The game says "a half of a bag of chips and a shovel on the floor." So the item is there. Maybe the command should be "take half of a bag of chips" without the "from floor" part. Alternatively, maybe the game expects a different phrasing. Since the user's previous action failed, they need to try a different command. The next step would be to try taking the item without specifying the floor, or perhaps use a different verb. But according to the game's previous interactions, the correct command might be "take half of a bag of chips" alone. So the next action should be that.
