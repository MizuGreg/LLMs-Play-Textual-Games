It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First stop, open the chest drawer. And then, pick up the old key from the chest drawer within the bedroom. After picking up the old key, make it so that the wooden door is unlocked. After that, ensure that the wooden door within the bedroom is open. After that, move east. With that done, open the screen door. And then, go east. Following that, try to move south. Okay, and then, recover the apple from the floor of the garden. If you can get your hands on the apple, head north. That done, try to head west. And then, put the apple on the stove in the kitchen. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Bedroom =-
You find yourself in a bedroom. A typical kind of place. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You see a chest drawer. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can make out a closed antique trunk here. You see a king-size bed. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You swear loudly.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me see. The user has already opened the chest drawer and picked up the old key. The next step according to the original instructions was to unlock the wooden door. So, using the old key, they need to unlock the door. The current location is the bedroom, and the wooden door is closed. The next action should be to unlock it. The user has a key, so the command would be to unlock the door. Let me check the previous steps again. Yes, after picking up the key, the next step is to unlock the door.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps given in the initial instructions. They started in the bedroom, opened the chest drawer, picked up the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door east. Now they're at the bedroom again, with the door open. The next step according to the original plan was to move east after opening the door. So the next action should be "go east". But wait, the user's last action was opening the wooden door, and the current location is probably outside the bedroom, east side. But the prompt says to move east again. Let me check the previous steps.

Wait, after opening the wooden door, the user is now in the next room, which might be the hallway or another area. The next step in the original task was to open the screen door, then go east, then move south, then recover the apple, etc. But the user's current location might be the east room of the bedroom. The next step after opening the door is to open the screen door. But the user's last action was opening the wooden door, so the next command should be "open screen door". However, the user's next action in the prompt is to move east again. Wait, the original instructions said after opening the wooden door in the bedroom, ensure the door is open, then move east. So maybe after opening the door, the user is now in the east room, which is the hallway. Then the next step is to open the screen door. But the user's current location might be the hallway. So the next action is "open screen door". But the user's last action was opening the wooden door, so the next step is to move east.

You make out a closed refrigerator. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. But there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the counter. You see a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a kitchen island! The kitchen island is normal. On the kitchen island you can see a note. Huh, weird.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Kitchen scene. The previous action was trying to go east, but they need to open the screen door first. The user's goal is to recover the apple from the garden, then put it on the stove in the kitchen. So far, they've unlocked and opened the wooden door in the bedroom, picked up the old key, and moved to the kitchen. Now, in the kitchen, there's a closed screen door leading east. The user needs to open that screen door before proceeding east.

The next logical step is to open the screen door. The user's previous action was attempting to go east without opening the door, which resulted in a message indicating the screen door needs to be opened first. Therefore, the correct command here is to open the screen door. After that, they can go east as intended. The user's score is at 5/7, so they're on the right track. Making sure to follow the sequence of opening the screen door before moving east is crucial. The answer should be "open screen door".

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Backyard now. The goal is to recover the apple from the garden, then put it on the stove in the kitchen. So far, they've opened several doors and moved east, but they're in the Backyard. The next step mentioned was after moving east from the kitchen, then trying to move south. But in the Backyard, the unblocked exit is south. So maybe they need to go south from here. The garden is probably in the south direction. The user needs to go south to reach the garden, find the apple, then head north back to the kitchen, then west to the stove. But the current location is the Backyard, so the next action should be to go south. Let me check the previous steps again. The user was told to move east from the kitchen, open the screen door, then go east to the backyard. Now, in the backyard, the unblocked exit is south. So the next step is to go south to the garden where the apple is. So the correct command is 'go south'.

Okay, the user tried to say "recover apple" but the system said that's not a recognized verb. So I need to figure out the correct command here. Let me check the game's context.

In the Garden scene, there's an apple on the floor. The task was to recover the apple. The valid actions would likely be "take apple" or "pick up apple". Since "recover" isn't a valid command, the user should use "take" instead. 

Looking back at previous interactions, the user used "pick up old key" which worked. So maybe the correct command here is "take apple". I should confirm that "take" is the right verb here. Yes, in text adventures, "take" is commonly used for picking up items. So the next action should be "take apple".

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Backyard again after picking up the apple in the Garden. The next step according to the original plan was to head north after picking up the apple. But now they're back in the Backyard, and the next action mentioned was to go west. Wait, the user's last action was "go north", which brought them back to the Backyard. The current prompt says to think about whether the actions so far are correct and then decide the next move.

The user needs to follow the sequence: after picking up the apple, go north, then west, then put the apple on the stove in the kitchen. But in the current state, they're in the Backyard. The previous steps were: pick up apple (9/11), go north (9/12). Now, the next step should be to go west, as per the original instructions. The user is at the Backyard, which has an open screen door leading west. So the next command should be "go west" to reach the Kitchen again, then put the apple on the stove. But the user's last action was "go north", which led back to the Backyard. The current prompt is asking for the next action, so the correct next step is to go west. The user might have confused the directions, but following the plan, after going north, the next is west. So the answer should be "go west".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in this text-based game. They've been moving through different rooms, picking up items like the old key, opening doors, and eventually recovering the apple. The current location is the Bathroom, and the next step according to the original plan was to put the apple on the stove in the kitchen.

But wait, the user just came from the Kitchen, went to the Backyard, then back to the Kitchen, and now they're in the Bathroom. The apple is still with them, right? The last action was going north to the Bathroom. Now, the next logical step would be to go back to the Kitchen to put the apple on the stove. However, the user might not realize that they need to go back through the available exits. The Bathroom has an exit to the south, which would lead back to the Kitchen. So the correct next action is to go south from the Bathroom back to the Kitchen. Then, they can proceed to put the apple on the stove. But the user's last input was "go north" to get to the Bathroom, so the next command should be "go south" to return to the Kitchen. That makes sense because the Bathroom's exit is south. So the answer should be "go south".

Okay, let's see. The user is in a game where they have to follow a series of steps to win. So far, they've opened a chest drawer, picked up a key, unlocked and opened a door, moved east, opened a screen door, went east again, moved south to the garden, recovered an apple, went north back to the backyard, then west to the kitchen, and then north again to the bathroom. Now they're back in the bathroom, and the next step is to go south again.

Wait, the original goal was to put the apple on the stove in the kitchen. The user has the apple now, right? They were in the garden, took the apple, went north to the backyard, then west to the kitchen. So they should be in the kitchen now. But the last move was going north from the kitchen to the bathroom, then south back to the kitchen. So now they're back in the kitchen. The next step is to go north again? Or maybe they need to go east to the screen door, then somewhere else?

Wait, the user's current location is the kitchen again. The previous steps were: after taking the apple, they went north to the backyard, then west to the kitchen. Then they went north again to the bathroom, then south back to the kitchen. Now, they need to go north again to get back to the backyard? Or maybe they need to go east to the screen door and then proceed further?

But the original plan was after getting the apple, go north, then west, then put the apple on the stove. So in the kitchen, they should be able to put the apple on the stove. But the stove is mentioned as being in the kitchen. So the user has the apple, and they need to put it on the stove. But the current location is the kitchen, so the next action should be to put the apple on the stove. However, the user's last action was going south to the kitchen, so they are now in the kitchen again. The next step is to put the apple on the stove. But the game's commands are limited to movement and actions like 'put apple on stove'. But the user has to input the correct command.

Wait, the user's previous action was 'go south' to get back to the kitchen. Now, they need to 'put apple on stove' to complete the goal. But the game might require the exact command. So the correct next action is 'put apple on stove'. But the user has to make sure they are in the kitchen where the stove is. Since they are in the kitchen, that's the right place. So the next command should be 'put apple on stove' to win the game.

-= Kitchen =-
You've just sauntered into a kitchen.

You make out a closed refrigerator. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. But there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the counter. You see a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a kitchen island! The kitchen island is normal. On the kitchen island you can see a note. Huh, weird.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in this text-based game. They've already completed several tasks: opened the chest drawer, picked up the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, moved east, opened the screen door, went east again, moved south to the garden, recovered the apple, went north, west, and back through various rooms. Now they're in the kitchen again, and the next step according to the original instructions was to "put the apple on the stove in the kitchen."

But when they tried to do that, the game responded with "You can't see any such thing." So the problem here is that the apple is in the user's inventory, but the stove might not be accessible or visible in the current location. The user is in the kitchen, so the stove should be there. Wait, in the kitchen description, it says "You see a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though." So the stove is present but maybe empty or not functional?

But the user has the apple. The instruction was to put the apple on the stove. However, the game's response indicates that the stove isn't visible or accessible. Maybe the stove is closed or not in a position where the apple can be placed. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to interact with the stove first, like opening it or turning it on.

But the user's last action was "put apple on stove," which didn't work. The game says they can't see the stove. Wait, but the user is in the kitchen, and the stove is mentioned. Maybe the stove is not in the current room? No, the description says "You see a stove." So why can't they put the apple on it?

Alternatively, maybe the stove is not a surface where items can be placed. Maybe the stove is a appliance that requires a different action, like turning it on or using it. But the original goal was to put the apple on the stove. Maybe the game expects the user to use the correct verb, like "put apple on stove" but the game's parser doesn't recognize it. Or perhaps the stove is not in the correct state.

Wait, the user is in the kitchen, and the stove is there. The apple is in their inventory. So the correct action should be to put the apple on the stove. But the game says "You can't see any such thing." That suggests that the stove isn't visible or accessible. But according to the description, the stove is visible. Maybe the stove is closed, and the user needs to open it first. But the description doesn't mention the stove being closed. It says "You see a stove," but maybe it's not functional.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go to the stove's location. But they are already in the kitchen. This is confusing. The user's next step should be to try putting the apple on the stove again, but the game is blocking it. Alternatively, maybe the stove is not the right place, and the user needs to find another location. But according to the original plan, the apple was in the garden, then the user went back to the kitchen, so the apple is now in the user's inventory.

Wait, the user recovered the apple from the garden, then went back through the kitchen. Now they are in the kitchen again. The next step was to put the apple on the stove. But the game says they can't see the stove. Maybe the stove is not in the current room? But the description says "You see a stove." Maybe the stove is not a surface where the apple can be placed. Maybe the stove is an appliance that requires a different action, like turning it on, but the user is supposed to put the apple on it as part of the task.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go to the stove's location. But they are already in the kitchen. This is a bit of a puzzle. The game's response is confusing. The user might need to try a different command, like "put apple on stove" again, but the game is not recognizing it. Or maybe the correct action is to "place apple on stove," but the game uses "put" as the verb.

Alternatively, maybe the stove is not the correct location. The user might need to go to the garden again, but that's not part of the original plan. The original plan was to go north from the garden, but that led them back through the kitchen and bathroom.

Given the confusion, the user's next action should be to try putting the apple on the stove again, even though the game says they can't see it. Maybe the game's parser is having issues, or the stove is in a different state. Alternatively, the user might need to interact with the stove first. But according to the game's description, the stove is present. So the correct action is to "put apple on stove," even though the game is blocking it. The user might need to proceed with that command again.
