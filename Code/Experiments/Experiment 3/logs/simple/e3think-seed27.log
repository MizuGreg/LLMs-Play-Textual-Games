Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. Your first objective is to look and see that the antique trunk is open. After that, pick up the old key from the antique trunk in the bedroom. After that, insert the old key into the wooden door inside the bedroom's lock to unlock it. And then, ensure that the wooden door in the bedroom is open. After that, travel east. Okay, and then, doublecheck that the refrigerator is ajar. Then, take the milk from the refrigerator. Then, place the milk on the stove inside the kitchen. That's it!

-= Bedroom =-
You arrive in a bedroom. A standard kind of place.

You can make out a closed chest drawer. You can see an antique trunk. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a king-size bed. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they need to follow a series of steps. So far, they've opened the antique trunk, taken the old key, and the score has increased. The next step according to the initial instructions was to insert the key into the wooden door in the bedroom to unlock it. The user hasn't done that yet.

Looking at the current environment, the bedroom has a closed wooden door leading east. The user has the key, so the next logical step is to use it on the door. The instruction says to insert the key into the lock to unlock the door. So the correct action here would be to try to unlock the door with the key. The user needs to go to the door, insert the key, and then unlock it. Once that's done, the door should open, and then they need to travel east as per the original plan. 

The user's previous actions were correct, and they're on track. The next step is to use the key on the door. The response should be a command like "unlock wooden door with old key" or something similar. But in the game's context, maybe the exact phrasing matters. The user has to interact with the door, so the correct command would be to try to unlock it. The user has the key, so the action is possible. Therefore, the next action is to unlock the door with the key.

Okay, let me figure out what's going on here. The user is in a text adventure game. Their goal is to follow a series of steps: open the antique trunk, take the key, unlock the door, check the refrigerator, get milk, and put it on the stove.

So far, they've opened the trunk, taken the key, unlocked the door, and tried going east. But the game says they have to open the door first. Wait, the door was already unlocked, right? The user tried to go east but the game said the door needs to be open. So maybe "unlocked" and "open" are different states here. The door is unlocked but not open yet. So the next step is to open the door.

The user just tried to go east, but the door is locked. Wait, no, the previous action was unlocking the door. The game message says "That's unlocked at the moment." So maybe the door is unlocked but still closed. So the user needs to open it. The correct action would be to open the door. Then they can go east.

Looking at the previous interactions, after unlocking, the user tried to go east but was told to open the door first. So the next step is to open the door. The command would be "open wooden door" or something similar. Then, once it's open, go east. So the next action is to open the door.

-= Kitchen =-
You've entered a kitchen.

You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a refrigerator. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can make out a counter. The counter is normal. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You see a stove. The stove is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You can see a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the kitchen now. Their next step was to check the refrigerator as per the original plan. The refrigerator is closed, so they need to open it. The previous steps were successful except for the door issue, but now they're in the kitchen. The next logical action is to open the refrigerator to get the milk. So the command should be "open refrigerator".

Okay, the user tried to "place milk on stove inside kitchen" but the game said that's not a recognized verb. So I need to think of the correct command. In text adventures, commands are usually more straightforward. Maybe "put milk on stove" or "place milk on stove". The user might have used "place" but the game didn't recognize it. Alternatively, maybe the correct verb is "put". Let me check the previous commands. The user had "take milk from refrigerator" which worked. So maybe the correct command is "put milk on stove". Let me try that.
