You are now playing a life changing round of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First off, make absolutely sure that the antique trunk is ajar. Then, retrieve the old key from the antique trunk. And then, make absolutely sure that the wooden door in the bedroom is unlocked. And then, look and see that the wooden door is open. And then, make an attempt to head east. And then, open the refrigerator inside the kitchen. If you have opened the refrigerator, pick up the lettuce from the refrigerator. And then, sit the lettuce on the stove inside the kitchen. Alright, thanks!

-= Bedroom =-
You are in a bedroom. A normal kind of place. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You can see a chest drawer. You can see a closed antique trunk, which looks usual, right there by you. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a king-size bed. The king-size bed is normal. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in the text adventure game. The goal seems to involve opening the wooden door in the bedroom, which requires using the old key. But the user tried to go east first, which wasn't allowed because the door was closed. Then they tried to open the door, but it needed unlocking with the key. Next, they tried to get the old key from the antique trunk, but the trunk was closed. The system message says the trunk is ajar, so maybe the user didn't open it yet.

Wait, the initial instruction said to make sure the antique trunk is ajar. The user might have missed that step. So the first thing is to open the trunk. Then retrieve the key. Then unlock the door. Then open the door. Then proceed east. Then go to the kitchen, open the fridge, get lettuce, put it on the stove.

But in the current state, the user tried to get the key from the trunk but couldn't because it was closed. So the correct action now is to open the antique trunk first. The user didn't do that yet. So the next step should be to open the trunk. Then get the key. Then unlock the door. Then open the door. Then go east. Then proceed with the kitchen tasks.

So the user's last action was trying to get the key from the trunk, but the trunk was closed. The system message says the trunk is ajar, but maybe the user didn't open it. Wait, the initial instruction said to make sure the trunk is ajar. So maybe the user needs to open it first. So the correct next action is to open the antique trunk. Then retrieve the key. Then unlock the door. Then open the door. Then go east. Then proceed to the kitchen.

So the user's current step is at 0/3, which might be the third step in the sequence. The user tried to get the key but couldn't because the trunk was closed. So the next action should be to open the trunk. Then get the key. Then unlock the door. Then open the door. Then go east. Then proceed to the kitchen.

Therefore, the correct next action is to open the antique trunk.

<think>
Okay, let me figure out what to do next. The user has been following the steps given in the initial instructions. They started by making sure the antique trunk is ajar, which they did by opening it and getting the old key. Then they unlocked the wooden door in the bedroom. Now, the next step according to the original plan was to look and see that the wooden door is open. Since they just unlocked it, maybe they need to check if it's open.

But the user's last action was unlocking the door, and the score increased. The next logical step would be to check if the door is open. However, in the game's context, after unlocking, the door should open. But maybe the game requires explicitly opening it. Alternatively, the next step might be to proceed east through the door. But the user's previous action was unlocking, so maybe the next step is to open the door. Wait, the initial instructions said: "make absolutely sure that the wooden door in the bedroom is unlocked. And then, look and see that the wooden door is open. And then, make an attempt to head east."

So after unlocking, they need to check that it's open. But how? Maybe the command is "open wooden door" again, but maybe the game automatically opens it after unlocking. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "look" at the door to confirm it's open. But the user's previous action was unlocking, and the next step is to check if it's open. However, the user's last action was unlocking, and the score is now 3/6. The next step would be to check if the door is open. But the user has to input a command. The possible commands here are "open wooden door" or "go east". But since the door was just unlocked, maybe the user needs to open it first. Wait, the initial instruction said "make absolutely sure that the wooden door in the bedroom is unlocked. And then, look and see that the wooden door is open." So after unlocking, they need to check that it's open. But how? Maybe the game requires the player to "open" the door again. Alternatively, maybe the door is automatically open after being unlocked. But in the game's context, maybe the user has to explicitly open it. However, the user just unlocked it, so maybe the next step is to go east. But the game might require the door to be open. So perhaps the user should first check if the door is open. But the user can't check unless they use a command. The available commands here would be "open wooden door" or "go east". Since the door was just unlocked, maybe the user can now go east. But the game might require the door to be opened. So maybe the next step is to open the door. But the user already unlocked it. Wait, maybe "unlock" and "open" are different actions. Maybe the door is unlocked but not open yet. So the user needs to open it. So the next step would be to open the wooden door. But the user already unlocked it. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "look" at the door to confirm it's open. But the game might not have a "look" command. The original instructions said to "look and see that the wooden door is open", so perhaps the user needs to check. But in the game's commands, maybe the user can just "go east" once the door is unlocked. But the game's previous message said "You have to open the wooden door first." So maybe the user needs to open it. But the user just unlocked it. Maybe the game requires the door to be opened, not just unlocked. So the next step is to open the door. So the command would be "open wooden door". But the user already unlocked it. Wait, maybe the user has to open the door after unlocking. So the next step is to open the door. Let me check the previous steps. The user unlocked the door, and the score increased. Now, the next step is to check if the door is open. But the user can't check unless they use a command. So maybe the next command is "open wooden door" again. But maybe the game allows moving east now. The original plan was to "make an attempt to head east" after ensuring the door is open. So perhaps the user can now go east. But the game might require the door to be open. So the next step is to go east. But the user has to make sure the door is open. So maybe the user should first open the door. But the user already unlocked it. Maybe the game considers unlocking and opening as separate steps. So the user needs to open the door. Therefore, the next command is "open wooden door".

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. An ordinary one.

You make out a refrigerator, so there's that. What's that over there? It looks like it's a counter. The counter is normal. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What's the point of an empty counter? You can see a stove. The stove is normal. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You make out a kitchen island. On the kitchen island you see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Okay, let me see. The user has been following the steps to open the antique trunk, get the key, unlock and open the wooden door, then go east to the kitchen. Now they're in the kitchen, opened the refrigerator, and found lettuce and chips. The next step according to the original plan was to pick up the lettuce. So the next action should be to take the lettuce from the refrigerator. But wait, the user just opened the refrigerator, so maybe they need to pick up the lettuce now. The command would be "take lettuce from refrigerator" or "get lettuce from refrigerator". But in the game's context, maybe "pick up lettuce" is sufficient. However, the previous action was "open refrigerator", so the next step is to retrieve the lettuce. The correct command here is "take lettuce from refrigerator". But the user's last action was "open refrigerator", so the next step is to pick up the lettuce. Let me check the previous interactions. The user was told to "pick up the lettuce from the refrigerator" after opening it. So the next command should be "take lettuce from refrigerator".
