I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is how to play! First, it would be great if you could ensure that the chest drawer within the bedroom is open. And then, retrieve the old key from the chest drawer. And then, unlock the wooden door with the old key. And then, ensure that the wooden door within the bedroom is open. And then, make an attempt to go east. And then, open the screen door. After opening the screen door, make an effort to go to the east. Then, take a trip south. And then, retrieve the bell pepper from the floor of the garden. If you can get your hands on the bell pepper, head north. Then, travel west. After that, rest the bell pepper on the stove. Got that? Good!

-= Bedroom =-
You're now in the bedroom. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You can make out a chest drawer. You can see a closed antique trunk. You make out a king-size bed. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Hm. Oh well

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

-= Kitchen =-
You've just sauntered into a kitchen.

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a refrigerator. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a counter. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. You make out a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. The stove is ordinary. The stove appears to be empty. You can see a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this TextWorld game and has followed a set of instructions. They've opened the chest drawer, retrieved the old key, unlocked the wooden door, opened it, and then went east into the kitchen. The current location is the kitchen, and they've just made it to step 5 out of 6. The next step in their original plan was to open the screen door, then go east again, then south, retrieve the bell pepper from the garden, head north, travel west, and rest the bell pepper on the stove.

But in the kitchen, there's a screen door leading east that's closed. The user's next action should be to open that screen door. The previous steps had them open the wooden door in the bedroom, so following the same pattern, opening the screen door makes sense. After opening it, they can try going east again. The user's next command should be "open screen door" to proceed.

If you're wondering why everything seems so ordinary all of a sudden, it's because you've just walked into the backyard. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You can see a set of chairs. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a set of chairs, go to TextWorld. The set of chairs is usual. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You see a bbq. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You swear loudly. You can see a patio table. Now why would someone leave that there? But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.

There is an open screen door leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

Okay, the user is trying to take the bell pepper from the floor in the garden, but they keep getting the message "You can't see any such thing." Let me check the previous steps. The user went south from the backyard into the garden, and the description says there's a half of a bag of chips, an apple, a bell pepper, and a shovel on the floor. So the bell pepper is there. Maybe the problem is that the user is trying to take it from the floor, but the correct command is just "take bell pepper" without specifying "from floor" since it's already on the floor. Let me check the game's possible commands. In TextWorld, you usually just say "take [object]" if it's in the room. The error might be because the user is using "from floor" which isn't a valid command. So the next action should be "take bell pepper" without the "from floor" part. Let me confirm that. Yes, the correct command is "take bell pepper".
