I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First off, ensure that the antique trunk within the bedroom is open. After that, recover the old key from the antique trunk. After that, make it so that the wooden door in the bedroom is unlocked with the old key. And then, make absolutely sure that the wooden door inside the bedroom is ajar. After opening the wooden door, go east. Then, doublecheck that the screen door is wide open. And then, attempt to travel east. And then, try to travel south. With that done, lift the milk from the floor of the garden. After stealing the milk, head north. And then, attempt to travel west. With that done, rest the milk on the stove. That's it!

-= Bedroom =-
I am sorry to announce that you are now in the bedroom. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a chest drawer. You scan the room for an antique trunk, and you find an antique trunk. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to a king-size bed. The king-size bed is standard. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. You think about smashing the king-size bed to bits, throwing the bits in the dump, etc, until you get bored.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

You can see a closed refrigerator in the room. You can make out a counter. The counter is usual. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. You scan the room, seeing a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. You can see a kitchen island. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? On the kitchen island you can see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they have to follow a series of steps to complete a task. The current scenario is in the Backyard. The user has already done several actions: opened the antique trunk, taken the key, unlocked the door, opened the door, went east to the Kitchen, checked the screen door, opened it, and went east again to the Backyard.

Now, the user is asked if they think they're making the right actions and if they're close to the goal. The next step mentioned in the original task was after opening the screen door and going east, then trying to travel south. But in the current state, they're in the Backyard. The next step in the original instructions was to "attempt to travel south" after going east from the kitchen. However, in the Backyard, there's an exit to the south that's unguarded. So the next logical step would be to go south from the Backyard. But the user needs to check if that's the correct next move according to the task.

Wait, the original task said after opening the screen door and going east (to the Backyard), then try to travel south. So from the Backyard, the user can go south. The Backyard's description says there's an unguarded exit to the south. So the correct action here is to go south. The user's next move should be "go south".

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, the user is stuck in the Garden area trying to pick up the milk. They've tried several variations of "pick up milk" but the game isn't recognizing it. Let me check the game's current state.

In the Garden, the description says: "There is a milk, a half of a bag of chips, a lettuce and a shovel on the floor." So the milk is indeed there. The user's previous attempts were using "take milk from floor" and "pick up milk from floor", but the game responds that the milk isn't visible. Maybe the correct verb is "take" instead of "pick up"? Or perhaps the milk is named differently. Wait, the game says "a milk" but maybe it's "milk" as a noun. Let me think about the possible commands. The user might need to use "take milk" without specifying the floor, since the milk is on the floor. Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "take milk" directly. Let me try that. The user's last attempt was "take milk from floor", but the game says "You can't see any such thing." Maybe the correct command is just "take milk". Let me check the previous interactions. The user tried "take milk from floor" and it didn't work. Maybe the game expects "take milk" without the location. Alternatively, maybe the milk is named "milk" and the user needs to use "take milk". Let me try that. The next action should be "take milk".

-= Bathroom =-
You arrive in a bathroom. A typical kind of place.

You see a closed ordinary looking toilet in the room. You see a bath. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? Hey, want to see a sink? Look over there, a sink. The sink is ordinary. On the sink you can make out a toothbrush.

There is an unblocked exit to the south.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

<think>
Okay, let's recap the user's progress so far. The original goal was to follow a series of steps: open the antique trunk, get the key, unlock and open the bedroom door, then go east to the kitchen, check the screen door, go east to the backyard, then try to travel south from there. Then, in the garden, pick up the milk, head north back to the backyard, then west to the kitchen, north to the bathroom, south back to the kitchen, and so on.

But the user has been moving around, picking up the milk in the garden, and now they're in the bathroom. The current step after the milk was to head north, which took them back to the kitchen, then again to the bathroom, then south back to the kitchen. Now, they're stuck in a loop between the bathroom and kitchen. The user's last action was 'go north' from the bathroom, which led them back to the kitchen. The next step would be to check the inventory to see if they have the milk, which they did pick up earlier. But the game's current state is in the kitchen again. The user might need to go south from the kitchen to exit the house, but the original task didn't specify that. However, the user's goal was to rest the milk on the stove. The milk was picked up in the garden, so they need to take it to the stove. But the stove is in the kitchen. So the user needs to go from the current location (kitchen) to the stove. But the kitchen has a stove, but the user hasn't interacted with it yet. So the next step should be to go to the stove and put the milk there. However, the user is currently in the kitchen, so maybe they need to 'go north' again to the bathroom, but that's not helpful. Wait, the user is in the kitchen, so they can directly go to the stove. The command would be 'go north' to reach the stove? No, the kitchen's description says there's a stove in the room. So the user can just 'put milk on stove' once they have it. But the user has the milk in their inventory. So the next action should be to 'put milk on stove' in the kitchen. But the user is in the kitchen, so they can directly do that. However, the game might require them to first go to the stove's location. But since the stove is in the kitchen, they can just put it there. So the correct command is 'put milk on stove'.

Okay, the user is trying to put the milk on the stove but keeps getting errors. Let me check the game state. The user is in the bathroom, but the milk was picked up in the garden. Wait, the user's last action was going from the kitchen to the bathroom, then back to the kitchen. The milk is in their inventory. The stove is in the kitchen. So the correct command should be to go to the kitchen (if not already there) and then put the milk on the stove. But the user is in the bathroom now. Wait, the previous steps: after picking up the milk in the garden, they went north to the backyard, then west to the kitchen, then north to the bathroom, then south back to the kitchen. So currently, the user is in the kitchen again. The stove is in the kitchen. So the user should be able to put the milk on the stove. The command should be "put milk on stove". But the game says "You can't see any such thing." Maybe the stove is not in the current room? Wait, the kitchen description says: "You can see a closed refrigerator in the room. You can make out a counter. The counter is usual. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. You scan the room, seeing a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. You can see a kitchen island. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? On the kitchen island you can see a note." So the stove is in the kitchen. The user is in the kitchen, so they should be able to put the milk on the stove. Maybe the correct command is "put milk on stove". But the user has tried that and got an error. Maybe the milk is not in their inventory? Wait, the user picked up the milk in the garden. So the inventory should have the milk. Alternatively, maybe the command should be "put milk on stove" without specifying the kitchen. But the game might require the user to be in the kitchen. Since the user is in the kitchen, the command should work. Maybe the game is not recognizing the stove as a valid place to put the milk. Alternatively, the user might need to first go to the stove's location. But the stove is in the kitchen. So the correct action is to "put milk on stove".

Okay, the user is stuck in the bathroom, trying to put the milk on the stove. They've tried multiple variations of the command but keep getting errors. Let me check the game state again.

The user is in the bathroom, but the milk was picked up in the garden. The previous steps showed that after picking up the milk, they went through several rooms, ending up in the bathroom. The original goal was to rest the milk on the stove. The stove is in the kitchen, so the user needs to go back to the kitchen.

But the user is currently in the bathroom. The command to go south would take them back to the kitchen. Once in the kitchen, they can put the milk on the stove. The error messages suggest that the milk isn't visible in the current room, which is the bathroom. So the correct sequence is: go south to the kitchen, then put the milk on the stove.

The user has been trying to put the milk in the bathroom, which is why it's not working. The next step is to go south to the kitchen. Then, once in the kitchen, they can use the correct command to put the milk on the stove.

-= Kitchen =-
Of every kitchen you could have sauntered into, you had to walk into an ordinary one. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You can see a closed refrigerator in the room. You can make out a counter. The counter is usual. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. You scan the room, seeing a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. You can see a kitchen island. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? On the kitchen island you can see a note.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.
