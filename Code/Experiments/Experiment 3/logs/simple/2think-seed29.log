Welcome to another exciting round of TextWorld! First of all, ensure that the antique trunk is open. After opening the antique trunk, take the old key from the antique trunk. And then, unlock the wooden door in the bedroom with the old key. And then, open the wooden door. Then, make an attempt to travel east. Okay, and then, doublecheck that the refrigerator is wide open. Once you have opened the refrigerator, take the bell pepper from the refrigerator. After that, rest the bell pepper on the stove inside the kitchen. That's it!

-= Bedroom =-
Look around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a bedroom.

You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a chest drawer. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You see an antique trunk. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out a king-size bed. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hm. Oh well

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps to open the antique trunk, take the old key, and then use it to unlock the wooden door in the bedroom. So far, they've successfully opened the trunk and taken the key. The next step mentioned in the original instructions was to unlock the wooden door with the old key.

Looking at the current environment description, there's a closed wooden door leading east. The user has the old key, so the logical next step is to use the key to unlock the door. The command should be "unlock wooden door with old key" or something similar. But in the game's context, maybe the exact phrasing is "unlock wooden door" since the key is already taken. Wait, the previous action was taking the key, so now they need to unlock the door. The game might require the command "unlock wooden door" or "use old key on wooden door". But the user's previous commands were "open antique trunk" and "take old key from antique trunk". The next step is to unlock the door, so the correct command would be "unlock wooden door". Let me check the previous interactions. The user was told to "unlock the wooden door in the bedroom with the old key". So the command should be "unlock wooden door" after taking the key. The system message says to only output the action, so the next command is "unlock wooden door".

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps given in the initial instructions. They started by opening the antique trunk, taking the old key, unlocking the wooden door, and then opening it. Now they're in the next part of the game, which probably leads them to the kitchen since the next step mentioned was checking the refrigerator.

The user's current location is the bedroom after opening the door. The next step in the original plan was to travel east. So the next action should be to go east. But wait, the user just opened the wooden door, so maybe they need to check if they're in the correct room. However, the instructions said after opening the door, they should try to travel east. So the next command should be "go east" to move to the kitchen. The user needs to follow the sequence: open the door, then move east to the kitchen where the refrigerator is located. The assistant's next action should be "go east".

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen.

You make out a closed refrigerator. You can see a counter. The counter is typical. The counter appears to be empty. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is typical. On the kitchen island you see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Okay, the user tried to say "doublecheck refrigerator" but the system didn't recognize it. Let me think about the correct command here. The user's goal is to open the refrigerator, take the bell pepper, and put it on the stove. So instead of "doublecheck," which isn't a valid action, they need to "open" the refrigerator. The correct command should be "open refrigerator." That makes sense because the refrigerator is closed, so opening it is the next logical step. Let me make sure that's the right action. Yes, the user is in the kitchen, and the refrigerator is closed. The valid command here is "open refrigerator." I'll go with that.

You open the refrigerator, revealing a bell pepper and an apple.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps to open the antique trunk, get the key, unlock and open the wooden door, then go east to the kitchen. Now they've opened the refrigerator, taken the bell pepper, and the next step is to rest the bell pepper on the stove.

The current location is the kitchen, and the previous action was taking the bell pepper. The next logical step would be to place it on the stove. The user mentioned "rest the bell pepper on the stove inside the kitchen." So the correct command here is "put bell pepper on stove." I need to make sure that's the exact phrase used. Let me check the previous interactions. The user said "rest the bell pepper on the stove," but in the game's context, the correct verb might be "put." However, the user's instruction said "rest," but maybe the game accepts "put." Wait, in the previous steps, the user used "take" and "open," so maybe "put" is the right verb here. Alternatively, maybe "rest" is acceptable. But the game's response to "put" would be correct. Let me confirm. The user's last action was "take bell pepper from refrigerator," so the next step is to put it on the stove. The correct command is "put bell pepper on stove." I should output that.
