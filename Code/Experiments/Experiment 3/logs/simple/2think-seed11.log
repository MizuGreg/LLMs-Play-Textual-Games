Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First step, assure that the chest drawer within the bedroom is opened. And then, retrieve the old key from the chest drawer. After that, make absolutely sure that the wooden door in the bedroom is unlocked with the old key. After that, open the wooden door inside the bedroom. After that, attempt to travel east. Following that, ensure that the refrigerator in the kitchen is open. And then, take the lettuce from the refrigerator inside the kitchen. And then, rest the lettuce on the stove. Alright, thanks!

-= Bedroom =-
You've stumbled into a typical room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be typical. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the bedroom.

As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a chest drawer. You make out a closed antique trunk. You can see a king-size bed. But the thing is empty.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps to open the chest drawer, take the old key, and now they've done that. The next step according to the original instructions was to unlock the wooden door in the bedroom with the old key. So the next action should be to unlock the door.

Wait, the user just took the key, so now they need to use it on the door. The door is closed, so they need to unlock it. The command would be "unlock wooden door with old key" or something similar. But in the game's context, maybe it's just "unlock wooden door" since the key is already in hand. Let me check the previous steps. The user was told to "make absolutely sure that the wooden door in the bedroom is unlocked with the old key." So the action is to unlock the door using the key. 

So the next command should be "unlock wooden door". Then, after that, open the door. So the next step is to unlock the door. The user has already taken the key, so they can proceed to unlock the door. The response should be "unlock wooden door".

Okay, let me figure out what to do next. The user has been following the steps: open the chest drawer, take the old key, unlock the wooden door, open it, and then travel east. Now they're in the kitchen, right? The next steps mentioned were to ensure the refrigerator is open, take the lettuce, and rest it on the stove.

Wait, after opening the wooden door east, the user would enter the kitchen. So the next action should be to go east. But the user hasn't done that yet. The last action was opening the wooden door, so the next step is to move east. Then, in the kitchen, they need to open the refrigerator. So the next command should be "go east" to move into the kitchen. Then, once there, open the refrigerator. But according to the instructions, after opening the door, the next step is to go east. So the correct next action is "go east".
</think>go east
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Kitchen =-
You've entered a kitchen. The room is well lit.

You make out a closed refrigerator right there by you. You make out a counter. But there isn't a thing on it. You make out a stove. The stove is standard. But there isn't a thing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an unguarded exit to the north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps to open the chest drawer, get the key, unlock and open the bedroom door, go east to the kitchen, and now they've opened the refrigerator. The goal was to retrieve the lettuce from the fridge and put it on the stove.

So far, the user has the lettuce. The next step is to take the lettuce. Then, they need to rest it on the stove. The current location is the kitchen, and the refrigerator is open. The user just opened the fridge, so the next command should be to take the lettuce. After that, they need to go to the stove, which is in the kitchen, and put the lettuce there. The user hasn't done that yet. The previous action was opening the fridge, so the next logical step is to take the lettuce. Then, move to the stove and put it down. The user's next command should be "take lettuce from refrigerator" or something similar. But the exact command might depend on the game's syntax. Since the user previously took the key from the chest drawer, maybe the correct command here is "take lettuce from refrigerator". Then, after that, go to the stove and put it there. The user hasn't done that yet, so the next action is to take the lettuce.

Okay, the user tried to "rest lettuce on stove" but the game didn't recognize it. So I need to figure out the correct command. Let me think about possible verbs related to putting something on the stove. Maybe "put" is the right verb. So instead of "rest," they should use "put." The correct command would be "put lettuce on stove." That makes sense because "put" is a common verb for placing items. Let me check if there are any other possible commands, but I think "put" is the right choice here. The user was trying to rest it, but the game expects "put." So the next action should be "put lettuce on stove."
