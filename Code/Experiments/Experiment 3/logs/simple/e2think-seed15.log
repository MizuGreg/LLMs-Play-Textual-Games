It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First stop, open the chest drawer. And then, pick up the old key from the chest drawer within the bedroom. After picking up the old key, make it so that the wooden door is unlocked. After that, ensure that the wooden door within the bedroom is open. After that, move east. With that done, open the screen door. And then, go east. Following that, try to move south. Okay, and then, recover the apple from the floor of the garden. If you can get your hands on the apple, head north. That done, try to head west. And then, put the apple on the stove in the kitchen. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Bedroom =-
You find yourself in a bedroom. A typical kind of place. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You see a chest drawer. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can make out a closed antique trunk here. You see a king-size bed. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You swear loudly.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me see. The user has already opened the chest drawer and picked up the old key. The next step according to the original instructions was to unlock the wooden door. So, using the old key, they need to unlock the door. The current location is the bedroom, and the wooden door is closed. The next action should be to unlock it. The user has a key, so the command would be to unlock the door. Let me check the previous steps again. Yes, after picking up the key, the next step is to unlock the door. Then open it, move east, open the screen door, etc. So the next action is to unlock the wooden door.

You've just sauntered into a kitchen.

You make out a closed refrigerator. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. But there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the counter. You see a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a kitchen island! The kitchen island is normal. On the kitchen island you can see a note. Huh, weird.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

Okay, let's recap the user's progress so far. They started in the bedroom, opened the chest drawer, picked up the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door leading east, which took them to the kitchen. Now, in the kitchen, they need to follow the next steps from the original plan.

The original task after opening the screen door and moving east was to try moving south. But in the current kitchen scene, the user is at the kitchen island. The available exits are east (closed screen door), west (open wooden door), north (unguarded entranceway), and south (unblocked exit). The user's next step according to the plan was to move east after opening the screen door. But the screen door is closed, so they need to open it first. However, the user's last action was "look", which didn't move them. The next logical step would be to open the screen door leading east. But wait, the original plan said after moving east (from the bedroom), open the screen door, then go east again, then try to move south. But in the kitchen, the screen door is east. So maybe the user needs to open the screen door first. However, the user is in the kitchen now. Wait, the user was in the bedroom, opened the door east to get to the kitchen. Now, in the kitchen, the screen door is east. So perhaps the next step is to open the screen door, then go east. But the user's current location is the kitchen, and the screen door is east. So the next action should be to open the screen door. But the user's last action was "look", and the system responded with the kitchen description. So the user needs to open the screen door east. But the user's next action should be "open screen door" or "go east" if the door is open. Wait, the screen door is closed, so they need to open it first. So the correct next action is to open the screen door. But the user's next action should be "open screen door" to proceed. However, the original plan said after moving east (from bedroom), open the screen door, then go east again. But in the kitchen, the screen door is east. So maybe the user is in the kitchen, and the screen door is east. So the next step is to open the screen door. But the user is in the kitchen, so the command would be "open screen door". But the system's current state shows the screen door as closed. So the user needs to open it. Therefore, the next action is "open screen door".

You've entered a backyard.

You see a set of chairs. The set of chairs is ordinary. But there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You make out a bbq. However, the bbq, like an empty bbq, has nothing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a patio table! The patio table is usual. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

There is an open screen door leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

You arrive in a garden. An usual kind of place. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked.

There is a milk, an apple, a lettuce and a shovel on the floor.

Okay, the user tried to say "recover apple" but the system said that's not a recognized verb. So I need to think of the correct command. The goal is to recover the apple from the floor of the garden. The available actions here are probably "take apple" or "pick up apple". Since "recover" isn't a valid command, the correct action would be "take apple" or "pick up apple". Let me check the previous steps. The user is in the garden, and the apple is on the floor. So the right command is "take apple".
