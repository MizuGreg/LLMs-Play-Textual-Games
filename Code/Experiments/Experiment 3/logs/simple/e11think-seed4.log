Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First, it would be great if you could make sure that the antique trunk is ajar. After that, recover the old key from the antique trunk. Then, make it so that the wooden door inside the bedroom is unlocked with the old key. Then, ensure that the wooden door inside the bedroom is open. Then, take a trip east. And then, ensure that the screen door is open. After that, attempt to travel east. Okay, and then, make an effort to head south. Then, pick up the half of a bag of chips from the floor of the garden. With the half of a bag of chips, attempt to go to the north. And then, try to travel west. Following that, sit the half of a bag of chips on the stove. That's it!

-= Bedroom =-
Well, here we are in a bedroom.

You see a closed chest drawer. You see an antique trunk. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a king-size bed. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, the user is having trouble with the game. They've tried multiple times to unlock the wooden door east using the old key, but the system keeps saying the sentence wasn't understood. Let me check the possible commands.

In TextWorld, the correct syntax for using an item to unlock something is usually "unlock [object] with [item]" or "use [item] on [object]". The user has tried "unlock wooden door east with old key" and "unlock wooden door east using old key", but maybe the game expects a different phrasing.

Wait, maybe the door is just called "door" instead of "wooden door east". Let me check the environment description again. The user is in the bedroom, and there's a closed wooden door leading east. So the door's name might be "door" or "wooden door east". 

Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "use old key on wooden door east". The game might require the "use" command instead of "unlock". Also, the user might need to specify the direction or the exact object name. 

Since the user has already taken the old key from the trunk, the next step is to use it on the door. The previous attempts used "unlock", but perhaps the correct verb is "use". Let me try "use old key on wooden door east". If that doesn't work, maybe "unlock door east with old key". 

But the user keeps getting errors, so maybe the door is just "door" without specifying east. Wait, the original description says "a closed wooden door leading east". So the door is east-facing. The correct command might be "unlock door east with old key". 

Alternatively, maybe the game expects "use old key to unlock door east". But the user has tried multiple variations. Since the system is not accepting the previous commands, perhaps the correct syntax is "unlock door east with old key". Let me try that.

Okay, the user is stuck on the game, repeatedly trying to unlock the door east with the old key, but the system isn't accepting it. Let me think about possible issues.

First, maybe the correct command is "use old key on door east" instead of "unlock". Text games often use "use" when interacting with items. Alternatively, the door might just be called "door" without the "east" part, since the direction is implied.

Alternatively, maybe the game expects "open door east with old key" instead of "unlock". Or perhaps the key is already in the inventory, so the command is just "unlock door east".

Wait, the user has already taken the old key from the trunk. So the key is in their inventory. The door is closed and leads east. The correct action is to use the key to unlock the door. Maybe the correct command is "unlock door east with old key", but the system isn't recognizing it. Maybe the game uses "use" instead of "unlock". Let me try "use old key on door east". If that doesn't work, maybe "open door east with old key". Alternatively, the door might be named differently. Since the user is in the bedroom, maybe the door is just "door" and the direction is east, so "unlock door with old key".

But the user has tried multiple variations and keeps getting errors. Maybe the game expects a different structure. Let me check the possible commands again. The user has to use the key to unlock the door. The correct syntax might be "unlock door east with old key". Since the system is not accepting it, maybe the game expects "use old key to unlock door east". But the user has to follow the exact command format.

Alternatively, maybe the door is already in the room, so the command is "unlock door with old key". But the user mentioned the door is east. Hmm. Maybe the correct command is "unlock door east using old key". But the user has tried that. Maybe the game is case-sensitive, so "Door East" instead of "door east". Or maybe the door is called "wooden door" instead of "door east".

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to first open the door, then unlock it. But that doesn't make sense. The key is for unlocking. Maybe the game is expecting "open door east with old key". But the user has to use the key to unlock, not open. 

Since the user is stuck, maybe the correct action is to try "use old key on door east" or "unlock door with old key". Let me try "unlock door with old key" as the next command.

First, the user previously tried "unlock door with old key" which worked, but now they're trying to open the door. Maybe the door is already unlocked, so they need to open it. But the game might require the correct command. The user might be using "open" when the correct verb is "unlock" or "use".

Alternatively, maybe the door is named differently. The original description says "a closed wooden door leading east". So the door's name could be "door" or "wooden door east". The user might need to specify the exact name. Also, the key was used to unlock it, so perhaps the door is now unlocked but closed, requiring opening.

The user's last attempt was "open wooden door east", but the system only understood "open wooden door". Maybe the direction "east" is optional or the game doesn't require it. Alternatively, the command should be "open door east" instead of "wooden door east".

Since the user is stuck, the next step is to try "open door east" without specifying "wooden" or "east" again. Or maybe "open door" if the direction is implied. Let me try "open door east" as the next command.

You arrive in a kitchen. A typical kind of place.

You see a refrigerator. You can see a counter. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the counter. You can make out a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a kitchen island. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The kitchen island is standard. On the kitchen island you see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Kitchen and Bathroom, going back and forth. The original goal was to eventually get to the garden and pick up the half-bag of chips. Let me check the previous steps.

The user had successfully unlocked the door east, opened it, and went east to the kitchen. Then they kept going north to the bathroom and south back to the kitchen. But the next step after the kitchen is the screen door east. The user hasn't tried opening that yet.

The original instructions mentioned ensuring the screen door is open after traveling east. So maybe after getting to the kitchen, the user needs to open the screen door east. But in the current state, the user is in the kitchen again. The screen door is closed, so the next action should be to open it. Then proceed east to the garden.

But the user has been going north and south repeatedly. The correct path is from the kitchen, go east through the screen door. So the next command should be "open screen door east" then "go east". But the user might not have tried that yet. Let me check the current location: the user is in the kitchen, and the screen door east is closed. So the next step is to open it.

First, the user might be using the wrong command structure. The game might require a different phrasing, like "open the screen door east" instead of "open screen door east". But the system says it only understood "open screen door".

Alternatively, maybe the door is named differently. The description mentions a "closed screen door leading east", so maybe the correct command is "open screen door" without specifying east, as the direction is implied. Or perhaps "open door east".

Okay, the user is in the Garden and needs to pick up the half of a bag of chips. The game says they can't see any such thing. Let me check the previous steps.

The user arrived in the Garden via the south direction from the Backyard. The description mentions "a tomato plant, an apple, a half of a bag of chips and a shovel on the floor." So the half-bag of chips is there. Maybe the user is using the wrong command. The correct command should be "take half of a bag of chips from floor" but the game says it's not visible. Alternatively, maybe the item is just "half of a bag of chips" and doesn't need "from floor". Let me try "take half of a bag of chips".

You arrive in a backyard. A standard one.

You make out a set of chairs. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a bbq. The bbq is ordinary. However, the bbq, like an empty bbq, has nothing on it. Hm. Oh well You see a patio table. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is an open screen door leading west. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.
