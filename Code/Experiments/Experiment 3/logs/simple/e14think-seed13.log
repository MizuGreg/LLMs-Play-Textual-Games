I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is how to play! First, it would be great if you could ensure that the chest drawer within the bedroom is open. And then, retrieve the old key from the chest drawer. And then, unlock the wooden door with the old key. And then, ensure that the wooden door within the bedroom is open. And then, make an attempt to go east. And then, open the screen door. After opening the screen door, make an effort to go to the east. Then, take a trip south. And then, retrieve the bell pepper from the floor of the garden. If you can get your hands on the bell pepper, head north. Then, travel west. After that, rest the bell pepper on the stove. Got that? Good!

-= Bedroom =-
You're now in the bedroom. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You can make out a chest drawer. You can see a closed antique trunk. You make out a king-size bed. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Hm. Oh well

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You swear loudly. You can see a patio table. Now why would someone leave that there? But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in the TextWorld game. They've reached the Garden area, where they need to retrieve the bell pepper from the floor. The user has tried "retrieve bell pepper from floor" and "take bell pepper from floor" multiple times, but the game keeps saying "You can't see any such thing." 

First, I need to check what's actually in the Garden. The description mentions a half of a bag of chips, an apple, a bell pepper, and a shovel on the floor. So the bell pepper is present. The problem might be with the command syntax. The user tried "take bell pepper from floor," but maybe the correct command is just "take bell pepper" since the object is on the floor. Alternatively, maybe the game expects a different phrasing, like "pick up bell pepper" or "get bell pepper."

But the user has already tried "take bell pepper from floor" and it didn't work. The game's response is "You can't see any such thing," which suggests that the bell pepper isn't visible. Wait, but the description says it's on the floor. Maybe the user needs to look around or check the floor more carefully. However, in TextWorld, sometimes you have to use specific commands. Maybe the correct command is just "take bell pepper" without specifying the floor, since the object is already in the room. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use "take" with the object's name without the location.

Another possibility is that the user is using the wrong verb. The game might expect "get" instead of "take." But the user has tried "take" already. Alternatively, maybe the bell pepper is hidden under something else, but the description says it's on the floor. 

Since the user is stuck here, the next step would be to try a different command. The original instruction was to "retrieve the bell pepper from the floor of the garden." So maybe the correct command is "take bell pepper" or "get bell pepper." Let's try "take bell pepper" without specifying the floor. If that doesn't work, maybe the game requires the user to look at the floor first, but in TextWorld, that's usually handled by the game's internal logic. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use "pick up" instead of "take."

But the user has already tried "take" multiple times. The game's response is "You can't see any such thing," which might be a bug, but more likely, the user is using the wrong command. Let's try "take bell pepper" again. If that fails, maybe the game expects "get bell pepper." Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check the inventory or use a different verb. However, the user's previous attempts have not worked, so the next step is to try a different command. The correct action here is to take the bell pepper, so the next command should be "take bell pepper."

-= Bathroom =-
You arrive in a bathroom. A normal kind of place.

You make out a toilet, so there's that. You can see a closed bath. You can make out a sink. The sink is standard. On the sink you can make out a toothbrush.

You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Kitchen =-
You've just sauntered into a kitchen.

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a refrigerator. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a counter. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. You make out a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. The stove is ordinary. The stove appears to be empty. You can see a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Kitchen and Bathroom. They keep going north and south, which is causing them to keep resetting. The original goal was to retrieve the bell pepper and then rest it on the stove. But the user already took the bell pepper from the garden. Now they're in the kitchen, but the stove is empty. The note on the kitchen island might have important info. The user needs to check the kitchen island for clues. Maybe the note has a hint on how to proceed. Alternatively, they might need to use the bell pepper on the stove. But the stove is empty. Wait, the user has the bell pepper, so maybe they need to put it on the stove. The command would be "put bell pepper on stove". Let me check the previous steps. The user was in the garden, took the bell pepper, then went back to the kitchen. The stove is in the kitchen. So the next step is to put the bell pepper on the stove. That's the next logical action.
