I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First off, ensure that the antique trunk within the bedroom is open. After that, recover the old key from the antique trunk. After that, make it so that the wooden door in the bedroom is unlocked with the old key. And then, make absolutely sure that the wooden door inside the bedroom is ajar. After opening the wooden door, go east. Then, doublecheck that the screen door is wide open. And then, attempt to travel east. And then, try to travel south. With that done, lift the milk from the floor of the garden. After stealing the milk, head north. And then, attempt to travel west. With that done, rest the milk on the stove. That's it!

-= Bedroom =-
I am sorry to announce that you are now in the bedroom. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a chest drawer. You scan the room for an antique trunk, and you find an antique trunk. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to a king-size bed. The king-size bed is standard. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. You think about smashing the king-size bed to bits, throwing the bits in the dump, etc, until you get bored.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in the TextWorld game. They've already opened the antique trunk, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door, opened it, and moved east to the kitchen. Now they need to double-check that the screen door is wide open and then try to travel east again. 

The user tried "doublecheck screen door is wide open" but got an error because "doublecheck" isn't a recognized verb. The correct action here would be to "open" the screen door if it's closed. But the prompt says to "doublecheck that the screen door is wide open," so maybe the intended action is to verify its state. However, since the game might not recognize "doublecheck," the user might need to use "open" if it's closed or "check" if that's a valid verb.

Looking at the previous steps, the user had to "open" the wooden door. So maybe the correct action here is "open screen door" to ensure it's open. Alternatively, if the screen door is already open, the user might just need to "check" it, but the game might not accept that. The user's next action should be to open the screen door if it's closed. But the user's instruction says to "doublecheck," so perhaps the correct command is "open screen door" to confirm it's open. 

Wait, in the kitchen description, the screen door is listed as "closed," so the user needs to open it. The previous action was moving east into the kitchen, and the screen door is closed. So the next step is to open the screen door. Then, after that, try to travel east again. So the correct command here is "open screen door."

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in the TextWorld game. They've been moving through rooms, opening doors, finding keys, and now they're in the Garden. The task is to lift the milk from the floor of the garden.

But the user has tried "take milk from floor" multiple times, and each time it's been unsuccessful. The game's response is "You can't see any such thing." So maybe the milk isn't on the floor as described. Let me check the previous messages.

In the Garden description, it says: "There is a milk, a half of a bag of chips, a lettuce and a shovel on the floor." Wait, the milk is on the floor. But when the user tried to take it, it didn't work. Maybe the correct command is just "take milk" without specifying "from floor" since the milk is already on the floor. Or perhaps the game expects a different phrasing. Alternatively, maybe the milk is in a different location. But according to the description, it's on the floor. 

Another possibility is that the user needs to use the correct verb. The game might require "pick up milk" instead of "take milk from floor." But the user has been using "take milk from floor," which might not be the right syntax. Let me think about the possible commands. In TextWorld, the correct command would be "take milk" if the milk is in the current room. Since the milk is on the floor, maybe just "take milk" is sufficient. The user might have been including "from floor" which isn't necessary. So the next action should be "take milk" without the "from floor" part. That's probably the correct command here.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the instructions in the TextWorld game. They've completed most of the steps up to resting the milk on the stove. The problem is that in the Backyard, there's no stove mentioned. The user tried "put milk on stove" but it didn't work because there's no stove here.

So, the next step after resting the milk on the stove would be to go north again. But since the stove isn't in the Backyard, maybe the user needs to go back to the Kitchen where the stove is. Wait, the previous steps had the user in the Backyard, and the Kitchen is north of the Backyard. Wait, no, earlier the user went from the Kitchen to the Backyard via east, then went south to the Garden, then north back to the Backyard. Hmm.

Wait, the user is currently in the Backyard. The original plan was after stealing the milk, head north, then attempt to travel west. But the user is stuck trying to put the milk on the stove in the Backyard, which doesn't exist. So maybe the correct approach is to go back to the Kitchen where the stove is located. But how?

Looking at the current location: Backyard. The exits are west (screen door) and south (unguarded exit). The user needs to find the stove. The stove was in the Kitchen. So perhaps the user needs to go back to the Kitchen by going west from the Backyard. But the Kitchen was previously north of the Backyard? Wait, earlier steps: the user was in the Kitchen, then went east to Backyard. So Backyard's north is the Kitchen. So to get back to the Kitchen, the user should go north from the Backyard. But the user is trying to put the milk on the stove, which is in the Kitchen. So maybe after resting the milk on the stove (but the stove isn't here), the next step is to go back to the Kitchen. But the user can't rest the milk on the stove here. So maybe the user needs to go back to the Kitchen, then put the milk on the stove there. But the user is stuck in the Backyard. So the next action should be to go north back to the Kitchen. But the user's last action was trying to put milk on stove in Backyard, which isn't possible. So the correct next step is to go north to the Kitchen, then put the milk on the stove. But the user is in the Backyard, so the next command should be "go north" to return to the Kitchen. Then, in the Kitchen, the stove is present. So the user should go north again to get back to the Kitchen, then put the milk on the stove. But the user's last attempt was in the Backyard, so the next action is "go north" to return to the Kitchen. Then, in the Kitchen, the stove is there, so "put milk on stove" would work. But the user is currently in the Backyard, so the next step is to go north to the Kitchen. Therefore, the correct command is "go north".

But there isn't a thing on it. You can see a kitchen island. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? On the kitchen island you can see a note.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.
