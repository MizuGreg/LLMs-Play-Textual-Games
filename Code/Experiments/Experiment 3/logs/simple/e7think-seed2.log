You are now playing a exciting game of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First stop, assure that the chest drawer in the bedroom is wide open. And then, pick up the old key from the chest drawer inside the bedroom. Then, check that the wooden door is unlocked with the old key. After unlocking the wooden door, assure that the wooden door is wide open. After that, head east. Then, ensure that the screen door in the kitchen is open. Then, make an attempt to move east. With that accomplished, make an attempt to head south. Then, pick-up the lettuce from the floor of the garden. Then, travel north. Then, try to take a trip west. Then, rest the lettuce on the stove inside the kitchen. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Bedroom =-
You arrive in a bedroom. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You make out a chest drawer. What's that over there? It looks like it's an antique trunk. Were you looking for a king-size bed? Because look over there, it's a king-size bed. The king-size bed is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

You see a closed refrigerator. What's that over there? It looks like it's a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is ordinary. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? Oh, great. Here's a bbq. The bbq appears to be empty. Hm. Oh well Look over there! a patio table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the patio table.

There is an open screen door leading west. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game and has followed a series of steps to reach the backyard. The current score is 7/8, and they're asking if they're on the right track and what their next move should be.

First, I need to recall the original task. The goal was to: open the chest drawer in the bedroom, pick up the old key, unlock and open the wooden door, go east to the kitchen, open the screen door, go east again to the backyard, then pick up lettuce in the garden, travel north, try west, rest the lettuce on the stove, and finally stop.

So far, the user has done all the steps up to opening the screen door in the kitchen and moving east to the backyard. The next step in the original plan was to ensure the screen door in the kitchen is open (which they did), then try to move east. But after moving east, they ended up in the backyard. The next step according to the original task was to pick up the lettuce from the garden. However, the current location is the backyard, which doesn't mention a garden. Wait, maybe the garden is part of the backyard? Or perhaps there's a mistake in the steps.

Looking at the environment descriptions: in the backyard, there's a patio table, chairs, bbq, but no mention of a garden or lettuce. The user's next step was supposed to be picking up the lettuce from the garden. But in the current location (backyard), there's no lettuce. So maybe the user needs to check if the garden is elsewhere. Alternatively, maybe the lettuce is in the kitchen or another area.

Wait, the original task said: "pick-up the lettuce from the floor of the garden." So the user needs to find the garden. In the current location (backyard), there's no garden mentioned. The user might need to go north from the backyard, as the kitchen's north entrance is unblocked. Wait, in the kitchen, the user was told to try going north. But after moving east from the kitchen, they ended up in the backyard. So perhaps the garden is in the north direction from the backyard? Or maybe the user needs to check the kitchen again.

Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the steps. Let me retrace:

After opening the screen door in the kitchen (step 6/7), they went east to the backyard (step 7/8). The next step in the original task was to pick up the lettuce from the garden. But in the backyard, there's no garden. So maybe the user needs to go back to the kitchen and try going north, which was mentioned as unblocked. The kitchen's north entrance is unblocked, so maybe that leads to the garden. Let me check the kitchen's description again.

In the kitchen, the user was told: "You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded." So going north from the kitchen is possible. So perhaps the user should go back to the kitchen, go north, and then find the garden there. But the user is currently in the backyard. So the next step would be to go west back to the kitchen, then north to the garden.

But according to the original plan, after moving east to the backyard (step 7/8), the next step was to pick up the lettuce from the garden. Since the user is in the backyard and can't find the lettuce there, they need to find the garden. So the correct next action would be to go north from the backyard, which was mentioned as unguarded. Wait, in the backyard description, it says: "You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south." So the user is in the backyard, and the south direction is unguarded. But the original plan says after the backyard, the user should go north. Wait, maybe the user needs to go back to the kitchen and then north.

Alternatively, maybe the garden is in the kitchen. But the user hasn't checked that yet. The original task says to pick up the lettuce from the garden, so the user needs to find the garden. Since the current location is the backyard, and the garden isn't there, the user should go back to the kitchen and then go north. So the next step would be to go west from the backyard back to the kitchen, then north to the garden.

But the user's next action should be based on the current location. The user is in the backyard. The next step in the original plan was to pick up the lettuce from the garden. So the user needs to find the garden. Since the backyard doesn't have a garden, the user must go back to the kitchen and then go north. Therefore, the next action is to go west back to the kitchen, then north. But according to the game's current state, the user is in the backyard. The possible directions from the backyard are west (to the kitchen) and south (which is unguarded). So the user should go west to the kitchen, then north to the garden.

But the user's next action should be the immediate next step. The user is in the backyard, so the next action is to go west to the kitchen. Then, from the kitchen, go north to the garden. So the correct next command is "go west" to return to the kitchen.

<think>
Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the kitchen and the bathroom. They keep going north and south, which isn't helping them find the lettuce in the garden. Let me check the original task again. The next step after the backyard was to pick up the lettuce from the garden. But the user hasn't found the garden yet. Maybe the garden is in a different part of the house. Wait, in the kitchen, there's a note on the kitchen island. Maybe the note has a clue about the garden's location. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check other areas. But since the user is repeatedly going between kitchen and bathroom, they might need to find another way. Maybe the garden is accessible from the kitchen's north entrance. But the user tried going north and ended up in the bathroom. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the user should check the kitchen island again for the note. The note might mention the garden. But the user hasn't looked there yet. Wait, in the kitchen description, it says "On the kitchen island you make out a note." The user hasn't checked that note yet. So maybe the next step is to look at the note on the kitchen island. But the user's current action is to go north, which isn't helpful. So the correct next action should be to check the note on the kitchen island instead of moving around. But according to the game's commands, the user can only move or pick up items. Since the note is on the kitchen island, the user needs to check it. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action should be to look at the note. However, the game might require the user to pick up the note first. Alternatively, maybe the note is a clue leading to the garden. But the user's current position is the kitchen, so they need to check the kitchen island. Therefore, the next action should be to look at the note on the kitchen island. But the game's commands might not allow that. Wait, the user's previous actions were moving between rooms, so maybe the next step is to check the kitchen island for the note. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the correct next action is to look at the note. However, the game might require the user to pick up the note first. But the user hasn't picked it up yet. So the next action should be to take the note from the kitchen island. But the user's current location is the kitchen, so they can check the kitchen island. Therefore, the next action is to check the note. But the game's commands might not allow that. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go back to the backyard and try another direction. But the user is stuck in a loop. The correct approach is to check the note on the kitchen island, which might provide a clue about the garden's location. So the next action should be to look at the note. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next command is to check the note. However, the game might require the user to pick it up. But the user hasn't done that. Therefore, the next action is to take the note from the kitchen island. But the user's current location is the kitchen, so they can do that. So the next command is "take note" or "pick up note". But the game's commands might be different. Alternatively, maybe the note is already in the kitchen, and the user needs to check it. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action is to check the note. However, the user's previous actions were moving, so maybe the next step is to check the kitchen island for the note. Therefore, the correct next action is to look at the note on the kitchen island. But the game might require the user to pick it up. So the next command is "take note" or "pick up note". But the user hasn't done that yet. Therefore, the next action should be to pick up the note from the kitchen island. But the user is in the kitchen, so they can do that. So the next command is "pick up note".

Well, here we are in a bathroom. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You make out a closed toilet. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a bath. You see a sink. You see a toothbrush on the sink.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

<think>
Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the kitchen and the bathroom. They keep going north and south, which isn't helping them find the lettuce in the garden. Let me check the original task again. The next step after the backyard was to pick up the lettuce from the garden. But the user hasn't found the garden yet. Maybe the garden is in a different part of the house. Wait, in the kitchen, there's a note on the kitchen island. The note said the dinner is missing a grilled lettuce. So maybe the lettuce is in the garden, and the user needs to find it. But the user is stuck in the kitchen and bathroom. The only way out is through the screen door east or the wooden door west. The user tried going east before and ended up in the backyard, but then got stuck in a loop. Maybe they need to go back to the backyard and check again. But the user is in the kitchen now. The correct next step is to go east through the screen door to the backyard again. Then, maybe the garden is there. But in the backyard description, there's no garden mentioned. Wait, the user was told to pick up the lettuce from the garden, so maybe the garden is in the backyard. But the user didn't find it yet. So the next action should be to go east from the kitchen to the backyard again. But the user is in the kitchen, so the command is "go east". That should take them back to the backyard. Then, they can look for the lettuce there. But in the backyard, the lettuce wasn't there. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the lettuce is in the kitchen. But the note said it's missing from the dinner. So maybe the user needs to go to the garden, which is in the backyard. But the user can't find it. Maybe the user needs to check the kitchen again for the note. But the note was already read. The user needs to find the lettuce in the garden. So the next step is to go east from the kitchen to the backyard again. So the correct command is "go east".

Okay, the user has finally reached the garden. The original goal was to pick up the lettuce from the garden. In the garden, there's a lettuce on the floor. So the next step is to pick it up. The user is in the garden, so the command should be "pick up lettuce". That should complete that part of the task. Then, after picking it up, the next steps would be to travel north, try west, and rest the lettuce on the stove. But the current focus is on picking up the lettuce. So the correct next action is to pick up the lettuce.

Okay, the user has completed most of the tasks except for resting the lettuce on the stove in the kitchen. They've picked up the lettuce in the garden, traveled north to the backyard, then back to the kitchen, and are now stuck in the loop between the kitchen and bathroom again. The next step is to go to the kitchen again and rest the lettuce on the stove. But since they're currently in the kitchen, they need to check the stove. However, the user might need to pick up the lettuce first if it's not already in hand. But earlier, they picked up the lettuce in the garden and brought it back. So the correct action is to rest the lettuce on the stove. The command would be "rest lettuce on stove".
