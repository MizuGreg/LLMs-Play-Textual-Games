You are now playing a life changing round of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First off, make absolutely sure that the antique trunk is ajar. Then, retrieve the old key from the antique trunk. And then, make absolutely sure that the wooden door in the bedroom is unlocked. And then, look and see that the wooden door is open. And then, make an attempt to head east. And then, open the refrigerator inside the kitchen. If you have opened the refrigerator, pick up the lettuce from the refrigerator. And then, sit the lettuce on the stove inside the kitchen. Alright, thanks!

-= Bedroom =-
You are in a bedroom. A normal kind of place. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You can see a chest drawer. You can see a closed antique trunk, which looks usual, right there by you. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a king-size bed. The king-size bed is normal. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game, and they've been following the steps given. The original goal was to get the lettuce from the fridge, put it on the stove, and maybe other steps. Let me check the current state.

The user started in the bedroom, opened the antique trunk to get the old key, used the key to unlock the wooden door, and now the door is unlocked. The next step mentioned in the initial instructions was to look and see that the wooden door is open. Wait, but the user just unlocked it. So maybe they need to check if it's open now. But the game's response after unlocking says the door is unlocked, so perhaps the next step is to open it. But the user might need to open the door before proceeding east.

Wait, the initial instructions said: "make absolutely sure that the wooden door in the bedroom is unlocked. And then, look and see that the wooden door is open. And then, make an attempt to head east." So after unlocking, they need to check if it's open. But maybe in the game, unlocking and opening are separate actions. However, the user just unlocked the door, so maybe the next step is to open it. But the game might automatically consider it open once unlocked. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to open the door manually.

But looking at the previous steps: the user was told to "make an attempt to head east" after ensuring the door is open. So the user is in the bedroom, unlocked the door, but maybe the door is still closed. So the next step would be to open the door. But the game's message after unlocking says "You unlock wooden door." So maybe the door is now open. Then the user can go east.

But the user's next action would be to go east. However, the user's last action was unlocking the door, and the current state is that the door is unlocked. So the next step is to go east. Let me check the previous messages. The user tried to go east first, but the game said they had to open the door first. Then they unlocked it, and now the door is unlocked. So the next step is to go east. Therefore, the correct action is "go east".

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in the game. They tried to open the wooden door but it's not working. They have the old key from the antique trunk. Wait, maybe the door is locked, so they need to unlock it with the key. But they already tried that. The game says "That's unlocked at the moment." Hmm, maybe the door is already unlocked, but it's still closed. So the next step is to open it. But the user is trying to go east, which requires the door to be open. So maybe after unlocking, they need to open the door. But the game message says they have to open the door first. Wait, maybe the door is locked and needs to be unlocked, then opened. But the user already unlocked it. Maybe there's a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe the door is unlocked but not open. So the correct action is to open the door after unlocking. But the game is giving errors. The user is getting confused. The original goal was to open the wooden door in the bedroom, then go east. So the next step is to open the door after unlocking. But the game says "You have to open the wooden door first." So maybe the user needs to open the door even though it's unlocked. So the next action should be to open the door. But the user is trying to go east, which is blocked. So the correct action is to open the door. But the game is not allowing it. Maybe the user needs to open the door after unlocking. So the next command should be "open wooden door".

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. An ordinary one.

You make out a refrigerator, so there's that. What's that over there? It looks like it's a counter. The counter is normal. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What's the point of an empty counter? You can see a stove. The stove is normal. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You make out a kitchen island. On the kitchen island you see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.
