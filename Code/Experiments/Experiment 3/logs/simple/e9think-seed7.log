Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an fast paced round of TextWorld? You do! Here is your task for today. First of all, you could, like, make sure that the chest drawer is wide open. After opening the chest drawer, pick up the old key from the chest drawer. Having got the old key, make sure that the wooden door is unlocked with the old key. And then, open the wooden door. After that, travel east. That done, ensure that the refrigerator inside the kitchen is open. And then, recover the apple from the refrigerator. After taking the apple, rest the apple on the stove in the kitchen. Alright, thanks!

-= Bedroom =-
You arrive in a bedroom. An ordinary kind of place. You can barely contain your excitement.

Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a chest drawer. Now why would someone leave that there? If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's an antique trunk. You can see a king-size bed. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The king-size bed is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

-= Kitchen =-
You've entered a kitchen.

Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a refrigerator. Now why would someone leave that there? You see a counter. The counter is typical. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a stove. The stove is standard. But there isn't a thing on it. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. Oh, great. Here's a kitchen island. The kitchen island is usual. On the kitchen island you can make out a note. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this!

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this TextWorld game and has followed a set of steps to reach the current point. They've opened the chest drawer, picked up the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, traveled east to the kitchen. Now they've opened the refrigerator, taken the apple, and tried to rest the apple on the stove. The system responded that "rest apple on stove" isn't a recognized verb.

So the next step is to figure out the correct command to put the apple on the stove. The user might be confused about the right phrasing. In TextWorld, commands are usually more straightforward. Instead of "rest apple on stove," maybe the correct command is "put apple on stove" or "place apple on stove." The word "rest" isn't a standard verb here, so the user needs to use "put" or "place."

Looking at the previous actions, the user used commands like "open refrigerator," "take apple from refrigerator," which follow the structure "verb object." So the correct command here should be "put apple on stove" or "place apple on stove." The user probably tried "rest" because they thought "rest" meant to put something down, but in the game's context, "put" is the right verb.

The user is also asking if they're on the right track. So far, they've completed the steps: opened the chest, got the key, unlocked the door, moved east, opened the fridge, took the apple. The next step is to put the apple on the stove. If they use the correct command, they should proceed. If they make a mistake, the game will prompt an error. So the next action should be "put apple on stove."
