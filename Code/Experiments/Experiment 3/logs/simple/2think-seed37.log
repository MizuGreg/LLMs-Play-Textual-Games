Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an exciting round of TextWorld? You do! First, it would be fantastic if you could ensure that the chest drawer is open. After that, recover the old key from the chest drawer. Then, check that the wooden door is unlocked with the old key. And then, ensure that the wooden door within the bedroom is open. And then, head east. And then, make absolutely sure that the screen door within the kitchen is wide open. After that, make an effort to go to the east. With that accomplished, make an attempt to go south. With that accomplished, lift the milk from the floor of the garden. After that, try to venture north. Then, make an attempt to travel west. With that done, rest the milk on the stove within the kitchen. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

I am excited to announce that you are now in the bedroom.

You see a closed chest drawer. You can make out an antique trunk. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You can make out a king-size bed! But the thing is empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the king-size bed.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this TextWorld game, and they've been following a series of steps. The current situation is in the bedroom. They first opened the chest drawer and found an old key. Then they tried to "recover old key from chest drawer," but the system said that's not a recognized verb.

Hmm, so the problem is that the command "recover old key from chest drawer" isn't valid. The game probably expects a different action. Since the key is already in the chest drawer, maybe the correct action is to take the key. The user might have confused "recover" with "take" or "get."

Looking back at the previous steps: the user opened the chest drawer, which revealed the old key. Now, the next step according to the original plan was to recover the key. But since "recover" isn't a valid command, the correct action here is to pick up the key. So the right command would be "take old key" or "get old key."

The user's next action should be to take the key from the chest drawer. The system's response was to say that "recover" isn't a verb, so they need to use the correct command. The user is also being asked if they're on the right track, but the main issue is the incorrect command. So the correct next step is to take the key.

Okay, let me see. The user is playing this TextWorld game, and they've followed a sequence of steps. The original goal was to go through various actions like opening the chest drawer, getting the key, unlocking the door, opening the wooden door in the bedroom, then moving east, making sure the screen door in the kitchen is open, and so on.

So far, the user has successfully opened the chest drawer, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door. The next step mentioned was to ensure the wooden door within the bedroom is open. Wait, the wooden door was already unlocked. But maybe they need to open it? Or maybe "unlock" and "open" are different actions here. The user just unlocked it, but maybe they need to open it now.

Looking at the current state: the wooden door leading east is unlocked. The next step in the original plan was to "ensure that the wooden door within the bedroom is open." So maybe after unlocking, they need to open it. But in some games, unlocking and opening are separate. So the user might need to open the door after unlocking it. But the game's response after unlocking was "You unlock wooden door." So maybe the next step is to open it. Alternatively, maybe the door is already open once unlocked. But the user's next action should be to open it. Let me check the previous steps again.

Original plan: After unlocking the wooden door, ensure it's open. So the user has unlocked it, but maybe needs to open it. So the next action would be "open wooden door". But the user's next command after unlocking was "open wooden door", but the game might not accept that. Wait, the user's previous action was "unlock wooden door with old key", and the game responded with "You unlock wooden door." Then the user's next action should be to open the door. But the user's next command was "open wooden door", but the game might not recognize that. Wait, no, the user's next action after unlocking was to "ensure that the wooden door within the bedroom is open." So maybe the user needs to open the door. But in the game's current state, the door is unlocked. Maybe the user needs to open it. So the next action is "open wooden door".

But the user's next command after unlocking was "open wooden door", but the game might not accept that. Wait, the user's next action was "unlock wooden door with old key", which worked. Then the next step is to open the door. So the correct command would be "open wooden door". But the user might have to check if that's the right action. Alternatively, maybe the door is already open. But according to the original plan, after unlocking, they need to ensure it's open. So the user should open it. Therefore, the next action is "open wooden door".

Okay, let's see. The user has been following a series of steps in the TextWorld game. The original goal was to perform a sequence of actions starting from the bedroom, opening the chest drawer, getting the key, unlocking and opening the wooden door, then going east to the kitchen, and then proceeding with other tasks like opening the screen door, going east again, trying to go south, lifting the milk from the garden, etc.

So far, the user has successfully opened the chest drawer, taken the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, and gone east into the kitchen. The current location is the kitchen, and the next step mentioned in the original instructions was to "make absolutely sure that the screen door within the kitchen is wide open." The user hasn't done that yet. 

Looking at the current environment in the kitchen, there's a closed screen door leading east and an open wooden door leading west. The user's next action should be to open the screen door. The previous action was "go east," which led to the kitchen, but the next step is to open the screen door. So the correct command here would be "open screen door" to ensure it's wide open as per the original plan. Then, after that, the user was supposed to go east again, but since the screen door is in the east, maybe that's the next step. But according to the user's last action, they went east into the kitchen, so maybe the screen door is already there. Wait, the kitchen's description says there's a closed screen door leading east. So the user needs to open that. Therefore, the next action should be to open the screen door.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game where they have to follow a series of steps to complete a goal. The current scenario is in the Backyard. The user has already opened the screen door and went east, leading them to the Backyard. Now, the next step according to the original instructions was to "make absolutely sure that the screen door within the kitchen is wide open." Wait, but they just opened the screen door in the Backyard. Hmm, maybe there's a confusion here.

Wait, looking back at the original instructions, after opening the screen door in the kitchen (which was east from the bedroom), the user was supposed to go east again. But in the current state, they are in the Backyard. The Backyard has a screen door leading west back to the Kitchen and an exit to the south. The original plan was after opening the screen door in the kitchen, go east again, then south, then lift the milk from the garden, etc.

But in the current step, the user is in the Backyard. The next action according to the original plan was to "make an attempt to go south." So maybe the next step is to go south from the Backyard. The Backyard's description says there's an unblocked exit to the south. So the correct action here would be to go south. The user has already opened the screen door in the kitchen, so maybe the next step is to go south from the Backyard. The user's previous action was opening the screen door in the Backyard, but the original plan was to go south after ensuring the kitchen screen door was open. Wait, maybe the user is a bit confused between the kitchen screen door and the backyard screen door. But according to the current location, they are in the Backyard. The next step in the original plan was after opening the screen door in the kitchen, go east again, then south. But perhaps the user is now in the Backyard, so the next step is to go south. The user's last action was opening the screen door in the Backyard, so the next action should be to go south. The Backyard has an exit to the south, so "go south" is the correct command here.

Okay, the user is trying to follow a series of steps in a text-based game. They've reached the Garden area, where they need to lift the milk from the floor. The previous attempt to "lift milk from floor of garden" was rejected because it's not a valid verb. 

First, I need to recall the correct commands in TextWorld. The valid verbs here would be "take" or "pick up" for picking up items. The user might have used "lift" which isn't recognized, so the correct command should be "take milk".

Next, the user's goal is to lift the milk, so the next action should be to take the milk. The game's response indicates that "lift" isn't a valid verb, so "take" is the right choice. 

I should check if there are any other possible commands, but in TextWorld, "take" is the standard verb for picking up items. Therefore, the correct command is "take milk".

Okay, let's see. The user has been following a series of steps in the TextWorld game. The original goal was to perform a series of actions in a specific order. Let me recap the steps to make sure I don't miss anything.

First, they had to open the chest drawer in the bedroom, recover the old key, unlock and open the wooden door east of the bedroom. Then go east to the kitchen, open the screen door, go east again to the backyard, then go south to the garden, lift the milk, and then go north back to the backyard. Now, they're in the backyard again, and the next step according to the original instructions was to rest the milk on the stove within the kitchen. 

Wait, the user just came back from the garden to the backyard. The milk is in their inventory now. The next step should be to go back to the kitchen, find the stove, and put the milk there. But in the current location, they're in the backyard. So the next action should be to go west through the screen door back to the kitchen. Once there, they can go to the stove and rest the milk. 

Looking at the current environment in the backyard, there's an open screen door leading west. So the correct next step is to go west to the kitchen. Then, in the kitchen, they can go to the stove and put the milk down. The user hasn't done that yet. So the next command should be 'go west' to return to the kitchen. Then, once in the kitchen, 'go to stove' or something similar. But according to the previous steps, after lifting the milk in the garden, they went north to the backyard. Now, they need to go west to the kitchen. So the next action is 'go west'.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following a series of steps in this text-based game. The original goal was to perform a specific sequence of actions: open the chest drawer, get the old key, unlock and open the wooden door, go east, open the screen door, go east again, go south, lift the milk, then go north, west, south, and finally rest the milk on the stove in the kitchen.

So far, the user has completed most of these steps. They've opened the chest drawer, taken the key, unlocked and opened the door, moved east to the kitchen, opened the screen door, went east to the backyard, south to the garden, lifted the milk, then went north back to the backyard, west to the kitchen, south to the living room. Now, the next step according to the original plan was to rest the milk on the stove in the kitchen. 

But in the current scene, the user is in the living room. The kitchen is to the north, but the exit to the north from the living room is unguarded. However, the user needs to go back to the kitchen, which is north from the living room. Wait, no—the kitchen was previously accessible from the backyard via the open screen door. But the user is now in the living room. So the next logical step is to go north from the living room to reach the kitchen again, then place the milk on the stove.

But the user's last action was going south from the kitchen to the living room. Now, they need to go back north to the kitchen. The current prompt says "You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north." So the next action should be to go north from the living room back to the kitchen. Once there, they can place the milk on the stove. 

The user's next command should be "go north" to return to the kitchen, then "put milk on stove" or something similar. But according to the game's verbs, the correct command would be "put milk on stove" once in the kitchen. However, the user's last action was "go south" leading to the living room. So the immediate next step is to go north back to the kitchen. Therefore, the correct command here is "go north".

You're now in a living room.

You can make out a couch. The couch is standard. On the couch you can make out a bell pepper. You see a low table. The low table is ordinary. On the low table you can see a remote. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this! You can make out a tv. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this TextWorld game, and they've been following a series of steps to complete tasks. The original goal was to go through a series of rooms, open things, collect items, and eventually reach the end. Let me recap the steps they've taken so far.

Starting in the bedroom, they opened the chest drawer, took the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, then went east to the kitchen. From there, they opened the screen door, went east to the backyard, then south to the garden where they picked up the milk. Then they went north back to the backyard, west to the kitchen, south to the living room, and then north again to the kitchen. Now they're back in the kitchen, and the next step is to rest the milk on the stove within the kitchen.

Wait, the last action was going north from the living room back to the kitchen. The current location is the kitchen. The next task is to rest the milk on the stove. But in the kitchen description, there's a stove mentioned. So the user needs to put the milk on the stove. However, in the previous steps, when they were in the kitchen, they had the milk. So the correct action here would be to put the milk on the stove. But the user has to use the right command. The possible commands here would be "put milk on stove" or "rest milk on stove". Since the game's previous commands used "rest", maybe that's the correct verb here. But the user's last action was "go north", leading them back to the kitchen. Now, they need to rest the milk on the stove. So the next command should be "rest milk on stove". But I need to check if that's the correct syntax. Alternatively, maybe "put milk on stove" is the correct command. However, in the game's context, the user previously used "rest" when they had to rest the milk, so maybe that's the right verb here. Let me check the previous steps. The user had to "rest the milk on the stove within the kitchen" as part of the original goal. So the correct command would be "rest milk on stove". But in the game's responses, when the user tried "lift milk", it was corrected to "take milk". So maybe the correct command here is "rest milk on stove". However, the user is currently in the kitchen, and the stove is present. So the next action should be to rest the milk on the stove. Therefore, the answer is "rest milk on stove".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to rest the milk on the stove in the kitchen. But in the current location, which is the Living Room, there's no stove mentioned. The previous steps led them back to the Kitchen, but the available actions there are going north, south, east, or west. The stove is in the kitchen, but the user is in the Living Room now. Wait, maybe they need to go back to the Kitchen first. But the command "rest milk on stove" is invalid because they're not in the Kitchen. So the correct step is to go back to the Kitchen, then rest the milk on the stove. But the user is in the Living Room, so the next action should be to go north to return to the Kitchen. Then, once in the Kitchen, they can rest the milk on the stove. But the user's last action was trying to rest the milk in the Living Room, which isn't possible. So the next command should be to go north to the Kitchen.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to complete a series of tasks in this text-based game. They started in the bedroom, opened the chest drawer, found the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, then went east to the kitchen. They opened the screen door, went east again to the backyard, then south to the garden where they picked up the milk. Then they went north back to the backyard, west to the kitchen, south to the living room, and back to the kitchen again.

The current location is the living room, and the user's last action was going north, which brought them back to the kitchen. Now, they need to rest the milk on the stove in the kitchen. But when they tried to do that, the system said "That's not a verb I recognise." So maybe the correct command is different. Instead of "rest", perhaps they need to "put" the milk on the stove. Let me check the previous actions. Earlier, they picked up the milk with "take milk", so maybe the correct verb here is "put". The user might have tried "rest" but the system doesn't recognize it. So the next action should be "put milk on stove". But the system might require the exact command. Alternatively, maybe "place milk on stove". However, in the game's context, the correct verb might be "put". Let me make sure. The user is in the kitchen now, and the stove is there. So the correct command is likely "put milk on stove".

Okay, let's try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game where they have to follow a series of steps to complete a task. The goal seems to be to perform a series of actions in different rooms, collecting items and moving through the environment.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Kitchen again. The previous attempts to "rest the milk on the stove" didn't work because the milk was in the Living Room, and the stove is in the Kitchen. The user tried going back and forth between rooms but couldn't get the milk to the stove. 

The key here is to make sure that the milk is on the stove in the Kitchen. The user has the milk, but they need to carry it from the Living Room to the Kitchen. However, the game's environment might not allow carrying items between rooms unless the user is in the same room as the destination. 

Since the user is in the Kitchen now, they need to check if the milk is here. But earlier, when they were in the Garden, they lifted the milk and then went to the Living Room. Now, they're back in the Kitchen. The milk must be in the Living Room unless they carried it somewhere else. 

Wait, the user's last action was "go north" to the Kitchen, but the milk was lifted in the Garden and then they went to the Living Room. So the milk is probably in the Living Room. But the user is now in the Kitchen. To rest the milk on the stove, they need to be in the Kitchen with the milk. 

But how do they get the milk from the Living Room to the Kitchen? The user can't carry the milk through rooms unless they are in the same room as the item. So maybe they need to go back to the Living Room, pick up the milk again (but they already have it), and then go back to the Kitchen. However, the game might not allow carrying items across rooms unless the user is in the same room as the destination. 

Alternatively, maybe the milk is already in the Kitchen, but the user isn't seeing it. The user needs to check the Kitchen for the milk. But according to the previous steps, the milk was in the Garden, then moved to the Living Room. 

Wait, the user's last action was "go north" to the Kitchen, but the milk was in the Living Room. So the user needs to go back to the Living Room, then go to the Kitchen again to rest the milk on the stove. But the game might not allow that unless the user is in the same room as the stove. 

Alternatively, maybe the user can just rest the milk on the stove even if they're in the Kitchen, but the game's logic requires that the milk is in the same room as the stove. Since the stove is in the Kitchen, the user needs to be in the Kitchen with the milk. 

But the user is in the Kitchen now, so they need to rest the milk on the stove. However, the previous attempt to "rest milk on stove" failed because the milk wasn't there. So the user must have the milk in their inventory. 

Wait, the user lifted the milk from the Garden, then went to the Living Room, then back to the Kitchen. So the milk should be with the user. Therefore, the correct action is to "rest milk on stove" in the Kitchen. But the game says "You can't see any such thing." Maybe the stove is in the Kitchen, but the user needs to be in the same room as the stove. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to put the milk on the stove, which is in the Kitchen. So the correct action is "put milk on stove" or "rest milk on stove". The game might accept "put" instead of "rest". 

But the user tried "rest milk on stove" and it didn't work. Maybe the correct verb is "put". So the next action should be "put milk on stove" in the Kitchen. That's the next step.
