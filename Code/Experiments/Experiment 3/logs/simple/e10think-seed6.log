Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! First of all, ensure that the antique trunk is open. And then, recover the old key from the antique trunk. With the old key, unlock the wooden door. And then, ensure that the wooden door is open. Then, make an effort to go to the east. After that, ensure that the screen door inside the kitchen is open. After pulling open the screen door, take a trip east. Next, attempt to venture south. After that, pick up the apple from the floor of the garden. After that, travel north. With that accomplished, go west. And then, sit the apple on the stove within the kitchen. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Bedroom =-
You arrive in a bedroom. A typical one. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You can make out a closed chest drawer, which looks usual, in the corner. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see an antique trunk. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a king-size bed. The king-size bed is standard. But there isn't a thing on it.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this TextWorld game and has followed a series of steps to progress. They've opened the antique trunk, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door, gone east to the kitchen, opened the screen door, went east again to the backyard, then south to the garden. In the garden, they picked up the apple. Now they're asking if they're on the right track and what their next move should be.

First, I need to recall the original goal. The user's initial instructions were to pick up the apple from the garden and put it on the stove in the kitchen. They've already done the first part (picking up the apple) and the next step was to travel north to the kitchen. But in the current state, they're in the garden. So the next logical step would be to go north back to the kitchen. Then, once there, place the apple on the stove. 

Looking at the current environment in the garden, the user has the apple. The next command should be to go north to the kitchen. Then, in the kitchen, they can interact with the stove. The user's last action was picking up the apple, so the immediate next step is to move north. The response should just be "go north" as per the instructions.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Garden and Backyard. They tried going north from the Garden but ended up back in the Backyard. The problem is that the exit to the north from the Garden is blocked or not properly navigated. Wait, looking at the previous steps, after picking up the apple in the Garden (score 8/10), they tried going north but got redirected to the Backyard. Maybe the correct path is to go west from the Backyard via the screen door, but the user kept going south and north, which isn't working.

Wait, the original goal was to go north from the Garden to the kitchen. But in the current state, when they're in the Garden, the unblocked exit is to the north. However, when they tried going north, they ended up in the Backyard. That suggests that maybe the Garden's north exit is actually leading to the Kitchen, but the game's narrative is confusing. Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the game's setup, but the user needs to follow the correct steps.

Wait, looking back: After picking up the apple in the Garden (score 8/10), the next step was to travel north. But when they tried going north, they were redirected to the Backyard. That doesn't make sense. Maybe the correct path is to go west from the Backyard via the screen door to the Kitchen. But the user was trying to go south and north, which isn't helpful.

Wait, the user's last action was going north from the Garden, which led them back to the Backyard. The correct next step should be to go west from the Backyard through the screen door to the Kitchen. But the user kept trying to go south and north, which isn't working. So the correct action here is to go west from the Backyard to the Kitchen. But the user's last command was go south, which brought them back to the Garden. So the correct next step is to go west from the Backyard to the Kitchen. But the user needs to realize that after being in the Backyard, they should go west through the screen door to the Kitchen. So the next command should be "go west" from the Backyard. But the user's last action was go south, which is not helpful. Therefore, the correct next action is to go west from the Backyard to the Kitchen.

Okay, the user is trying to put the apple on the stove in the kitchen, but the game says they can't see any such thing. Let me check the previous steps. The user picked up the apple in the garden and went west from the backyard to the kitchen. Now, in the kitchen, they have the apple. But the stove is described as ordinary and empty. Maybe the apple is already on the stove, but the game isn't recognizing it. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to interact with the stove first. Wait, the user has the apple, so perhaps they need to put it on the stove. But the game's response says they can't see the stove. Wait, the kitchen description mentions a stove, but maybe it's not visible. Maybe the user needs to open the stove or check the stove's location. Alternatively, maybe the apple is already on the stove, but the game's logic isn't updating. Since the user has the apple, the correct action is to put it on the stove. The game might have a bug, but according to the instructions, the next action should be to put the apple on the stove. So the answer is "put apple on stove".

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop where they can't put the apple on the stove. Let me check the previous steps again. The user picked up the apple in the garden and went to the kitchen. In the kitchen, they have the apple but can't place it on the stove. The game's response says "You can't see any such thing." Maybe the stove is not visible or needs to be interacted with first. Alternatively, maybe the apple is already on the stove, but the game isn't recognizing it. Since the user has the apple, the correct action is to put it on the stove. The game might have a bug, but according to the instructions, the next action should be "put apple on stove".
