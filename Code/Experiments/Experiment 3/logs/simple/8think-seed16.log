I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, open the antique trunk. And then, retrieve the old key from the antique trunk. With the old key, unlock the wooden door inside the bedroom with the old key. Then, ensure that the wooden door is open. And then, head east. After that, ensure that the screen door is open. And then, head east. And then, try to move south. And then, pick-up the bell pepper from the floor of the garden. With the bell pepper, attempt to head north. With that accomplished, go to the west. And then, place the bell pepper on the stove. Alright, thanks!

-= Bedroom =-
Ah, the bedroom. This is some kind of bedroom, really great normal vibes in this place, a wonderful normal atmosphere. You can barely contain your excitement.

You can make out a closed chest drawer in the room. You can see a closed antique trunk nearby. You make out a king-size bed. The king-size bed is normal. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they have to follow a series of steps to complete a task. So far, they've opened an antique trunk, retrieved a key, unlocked a door, and opened it. Then they moved east into the kitchen. Now, they need to open the screen door to go east again.

The user's current location is the kitchen, and there's a closed screen door leading east. The previous attempt to go east failed because the screen door was closed. The user needs to open it before proceeding. The next logical step is to open the screen door. The user might be wondering if they're on the right track. 

Considering the task list, after ensuring the screen door is open, they need to go east again and then try to move south. The user might be confused if they're missing steps or if they need to collect items like the bell pepper. But according to the current progress, the immediate next action is to open the screen door. The user's previous action was trying to go east, which wasn't possible without opening the door. So the correct next command is to open the screen door.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in the Garden area. They need to pick up the bell pepper, but the system is not recognizing it. The previous attempts to "take the bell pepper from the floor" resulted in "You can't see any such thing." So maybe the correct command is just "take bell pepper" without specifying the floor. Alternatively, maybe the bell pepper is in a different location.

Looking at the description of the Garden: "There is a milk, a half of a bag of chips, a bell pepper and a shovel on the floor." So the bell pepper is on the floor. The user tried "pick up the bell pepper from the floor" and "take the bell pepper from the floor," but the system says it can't see it. Maybe the correct verb is "take" instead of "pick up," or maybe the object is just "bell pepper" without specifying the floor. Let's try "take bell pepper" as the command. If that doesn't work, maybe the user needs to use the correct preposition or verb. Since the system is not accepting "from the floor," perhaps the correct command is simply "take bell pepper."

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Garden and Backyard areas. They've been going back and forth between north and south, which is causing them to get stuck. The main issue is that they're not making progress towards the original goal, which was to reach the original goal mentioned in the initial task. The user's actions have been repetitive, going north and south repeatedly, which isn't helping them move forward.

The original task required them to pick up the bell pepper and then place it on the stove. However, the user hasn't successfully picked up the bell pepper yet. They tried several times but kept getting errors. The last attempt was "take bell pepper," which worked once, but then they started moving around again without completing the task.

Now, the user is asking if they're on the right track. The answer is that they're not. They need to focus on completing the steps they've already started. After picking up the bell pepper, the next step was to place it on the stove. The user hasn't done that yet. The stove is in the kitchen, so they need to go back to the kitchen, not keep moving around the garden and backyard.

So the correct next action should be to go west back to the kitchen, then place the bell pepper on the stove. But the user is currently in the Backyard, so the next step is to go south to the Garden again, then find the stove in the kitchen. Wait, but the stove is in the kitchen, which is east of the bedroom. The user has already passed through the kitchen earlier. Maybe they need to go back to the kitchen from the Backyard via the screen door.

But the user's current location is the Backyard, and the next step should be to go west through the screen door back to the Kitchen. Then, place the bell pepper on the stove. However, the user hasn't done that yet. So the correct action is to go west to the Kitchen, then place the bell pepper on the stove. But the user is in the Backyard, so the next command should be "go west" to return to the Kitchen. However, the user might not realize that the stove is in the Kitchen, so they need to be directed there.

Alternatively, maybe the user is confused about the locations. The stove is in the Kitchen, which is east of the Bedroom. The user has already been in the Kitchen before. So the correct path is to go back to the Kitchen, then place the bell pepper on the stove. Therefore, the next action should be to go west from the Backyard to the Kitchen, then place the bell pepper on the stove.

Look over there! a toilet. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You make out a bath. You see a sink. The sink is normal. On the sink you can see a toothbrush.

There is an unguarded exit to the south.

You are in a kitchen. It seems to be pretty usual here.

Were you looking for a refrigerator? Because look over there, it's a refrigerator. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. The counter appears to be empty. You scan the room, seeing a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is typical. On the kitchen island you make out a note. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Kitchen and Bathroom, going back and forth. The original goal was to pick up the bell pepper and place it on the stove. But they've been moving around a lot without achieving that.

Wait, the last action was going north from the Bathroom to the Kitchen again. The user hasn't placed the bell pepper on the stove yet. The Garden was mentioned earlier where the bell pepper was on the floor. The user picked it up but then got distracted by moving around.

So the key steps left are: after picking up the bell pepper, they need to go north to the Garden, then place the bell pepper on the stove. But in the current state, they're in the Kitchen again. They need to find the stove, which is in the Kitchen. Wait, the stove was mentioned in the Kitchen description. So maybe the user needs to go back to the Garden, then to the Kitchen, find the stove, and place the bell pepper there.

But the user is currently in the Kitchen, so maybe they need to go south from the Kitchen to the Bathroom again, then find a way back to the Garden. Alternatively, maybe the stove is in the Kitchen, so after picking up the bell pepper, they should go to the Kitchen's stove and place it there. But the user hasn't done that yet.

Wait, the user picked up the bell pepper in the Garden, then went back and forth between Kitchen and Bathroom. They need to go back to the Garden, then to the Kitchen, then to the stove. But the current position is the Kitchen. So the next step should be to go north to the Bathroom again, then south to the Kitchen, then find the stove and place the bell pepper. But the user hasn't done that yet.

Alternatively, maybe the stove is in the Kitchen, so the user should go to the stove in the Kitchen and place the bell pepper there. But the user hasn't done that. The previous steps were moving around without completing the task. The user needs to go from the Kitchen to the Garden, then to the stove. But how?

Wait, the user is in the Kitchen. The Garden is accessible via the screen door in the Kitchen (east) but the user had to open it. But earlier, when they were in the Kitchen, they tried going east but the screen door was closed. Then they had to open it. But after that, they went east to the Backyard, then south to the Garden. But then they got stuck in a loop.

So maybe the user needs to go back from the Kitchen to the Garden via the screen door (east), then go to the stove. But the stove is in the Kitchen. Wait, no, the stove was mentioned in the Kitchen description. So the user needs to go to the stove in the Kitchen and place the bell pepper there. But the user hasn't done that yet.

But the user is currently in the Kitchen. So the next step should be to go to the stove and place the bell pepper. However, the user hasn't placed it yet. The user has the bell pepper, so they need to go to the stove and put it there. But the stove's location is in the Kitchen. So the user should go to the stove and place the bell pepper.

But the user hasn't done that. The previous steps were moving around, so the next action should be to go to the stove and place the bell pepper. However, the user might not know where the stove is. But in the Kitchen description, it's mentioned that the stove is there. So the user should go to the stove and place the bell pepper.

But the user is in the Kitchen. So the next action is to go to the stove and place the bell pepper. However, the user hasn't done that yet. The user's last action was going north to the Bathroom, so the next step should be to go south back to the Kitchen, then go to the stove and place the bell pepper.

But the user is in the Kitchen, so maybe the next step is to go to the stove and place the bell pepper. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the correct action is to place the bell pepper on the stove.

<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is in a text adventure game, and their goal is to follow a series of steps to complete tasks. So far, they've managed to open the antique trunk, get the old key, unlock the wooden door, open it, go east through the screen door, and end up in the garden where they picked up the bell pepper. Now they're in the bathroom, and the last step was to place the bell pepper on the stove.

But the problem is that the user is in the bathroom, and the stove is in the kitchen. The bell pepper was picked up in the garden, so they need to carry it from the bathroom to the kitchen. However, the current location is the bathroom, and the stove is in the kitchen. The user might have forgotten that they need to go back to the kitchen to place the bell pepper on the stove. 

Looking at the previous steps, after picking up the bell pepper in the garden, they went back through the backyard, kitchen, bathroom, and back to the kitchen. But they're now in the bathroom again. So the next logical step would be to go back to the kitchen, then to the stove. However, the user tried to place the bell pepper on the stove directly from the bathroom, which isn't possible because the stove is in the kitchen. 

Therefore, the correct action would be to go back to the kitchen first, then place the bell pepper on the stove. But the user's last command was "put bell pepper on stove" from the bathroom, which isn't possible. So the correct next step is to go to the kitchen, then place the bell pepper on the stove. But the user might not have realized they need to go back to the kitchen first. 

Alternatively, maybe the stove is in the bathroom, but according to the previous descriptions, the stove was in the kitchen. The bathroom description mentions a toilet, bath, sink, but not a stove. So the stove must be in the kitchen. Therefore, the user needs to go back to the kitchen to place the bell pepper on the stove. 

So the next action should be to go north back to the kitchen, then put the bell pepper on the stove. But the user is currently in the bathroom, so the first step is to go north to the kitchen. Then, once in the kitchen, they can put the bell pepper on the stove. 

But the user's last attempt was to put the bell pepper on the stove from the bathroom, which isn't possible. Therefore, the correct next step is to go back to the kitchen first.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the kitchen and bathroom. They tried to place the bell pepper on the stove but couldn't because they're in the bathroom now. The main goal was to place the bell pepper on the stove in the kitchen. The user has been going back and forth between rooms without addressing the stove.

First, I need to make sure they're in the kitchen where the stove is. The last action was going south from the bathroom back to the kitchen. Now, they need to focus on the stove. The bell pepper is with them, so they should use the command to put it on the stove. But the previous attempts to do so failed because they were in the bathroom. So the correct step is to go back to the kitchen, then place the bell pepper on the stove. But since they're already in the kitchen, maybe the issue is the correct command format. The correct command should be "put bell pepper on stove" or "place bell pepper on stove". However, the system might require the exact phrasing. Alternatively, maybe the stove is in a different location. But according to the kitchen description, the stove is present. So the next step is to use the correct command to place the bell pepper on the stove.
