I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, open the antique trunk. And then, retrieve the old key from the antique trunk. With the old key, unlock the wooden door inside the bedroom with the old key. Then, ensure that the wooden door is open. And then, head east. After that, ensure that the screen door is open. And then, head east. And then, try to move south. And then, pick-up the bell pepper from the floor of the garden. With the bell pepper, attempt to head north. With that accomplished, go to the west. And then, place the bell pepper on the stove. Alright, thanks!

-= Bedroom =-
Ah, the bedroom. This is some kind of bedroom, really great normal vibes in this place, a wonderful normal atmosphere. You can barely contain your excitement.

You can make out a closed chest drawer in the room. You can see a closed antique trunk nearby. You make out a king-size bed. The king-size bed is normal. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. It seems to be pretty usual here.

Were you looking for a refrigerator? Because look over there, it's a refrigerator. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. The counter appears to be empty. You scan the room, seeing a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is typical. On the kitchen island you make out a note. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me figure out what to do next. The user has been following a series of steps in the TextWorld game. So far, they've opened the antique trunk, retrieved the old key, unlocked the wooden door, opened it, went east into the kitchen, and now they're in the kitchen. The next step in the original task was to ensure the screen door is open, then go east again, then try to move south. But in the current state, they're in the kitchen, and the screen door leading east is closed. 

Wait, the user's last action was "go east", which led them to the kitchen. Now, the kitchen description mentions a closed screen door leading east. So the next step according to the task is to ensure the screen door is open. But the user hasn't done that yet. However, in the current prompt, the user is in the kitchen, and the screen door is closed. So the next action should be to open the screen door.

But looking at the previous steps, the user had to "ensure that the screen door is open" after going east. So after entering the kitchen, they need to open the screen door. But the user's last action was "go east", which brought them to the kitchen. Now, the next step is to open the screen door. However, the user might have to use the correct verb here. The game might not accept "open the screen door" directly, but perhaps "open screen door" or "unlock" if it's locked. But in the previous steps, the user used "open" for the wooden door. Let me check the previous interactions.

In the bedroom, the user opened the wooden door. Then, in the kitchen, the screen door is closed. So the next action should be to open the screen door. But the user's previous attempt to "ensure that the screen door is open" was rejected because it's not a verb. So the correct command would be "open screen door".

But the user's next action after entering the kitchen is to open the screen door. Then, after that, they need to go east again. Then, try to move south. Then, pick up the bell pepper, etc.

So the next step is to open the screen door. The user's current location is the kitchen, and the screen door is closed. Therefore, the correct command is "open screen door".

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Backyard again after trying to go north from the Garden. They picked up the bell pepper and tried to go north, but that didn't work. Now they're back in the Backyard. The original goal was to pick up the bell pepper from the garden, then use it to head north, then go west and place it on the stove. But maybe the steps need to be adjusted.

Wait, the user is in the Backyard now. The Garden had the bell pepper on the floor, which they picked up. Then they tried to go north, which led them back to the Backyard. Maybe the next step is to go south from the Backyard to return to the Garden. But the original plan was to go north from the Garden with the bell pepper. However, since going north from the Garden didn't work, perhaps they need to check if the bell pepper is in their inventory and then try again. Alternatively, maybe they need to go south to the Garden again and then try heading north again. But the user's last action was "go north" which didn't work, so maybe the correct command is "go south" to return to the Garden. Then, with the bell pepper, try to go north again. But the user is in the Backyard now, so the next step would be to go south to the Garden. But the user's current location is the Backyard, so "go south" would take them back to the Garden. Then, they can try heading north again. However, the user's next action should be "go south" to return to the Garden. But the user might have to check if the bell pepper is in their inventory. Since they picked it up earlier, it should be there. So the next step is to go south to the Garden and then try to go north again. But the user is in the Backyard, so the next command is "go south".

<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out what's going on here. The user is stuck in a loop between the Garden and Backyard, repeatedly going north and south. The original goal was to pick up the bell pepper from the garden, then use it to head north, then go west and place it on the stove. But the user has already picked up the bell pepper and is trying to go north again.

Wait, when the user was in the Garden, they picked up the bell pepper. Then they tried to go north, which led them back to the Backyard. Now, they're trying to go south again to get back to the Garden. But the problem is that the bell pepper is in their inventory, so maybe they need to use it somewhere. The original plan was to place the bell pepper on the stove. But the stove is in the kitchen, not the garden. So maybe the user needs to go back to the kitchen, but how?

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west from the Backyard through the screen door. The Backyard has an open screen door leading west, which might lead to another area. But the user hasn't tried that yet. However, the user's last action was going south, which brings them back to the Garden. The Garden has the shovel and other items, but the stove is in the kitchen. So perhaps the user needs to go back to the kitchen, but they have to navigate through the doors again.

Wait, the user's current location is the Garden. The original task was to place the bell pepper on the stove. The stove is in the kitchen. So the user needs to go from the Garden to the kitchen. But how? The Garden's description says to try going north. Maybe the north direction from the Garden leads to the kitchen. But earlier, when the user tried going north from the Garden, they ended up in the Backyard. That's confusing. Maybe there's a mistake in the game's layout, or perhaps the user is missing a step.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west from the Backyard. The Backyard has an open screen door leading west. If they go west, maybe that leads to the kitchen or another area. But the user hasn't tried that yet. So perhaps the correct next step is to go west from the Backyard. But the user is in the Garden now, so they need to go south to the Backyard again, then west. But the user is stuck in a loop, so maybe they need to find a different path.

Wait, the user has the bell pepper in their inventory. The original goal was to place it on the stove. The stove is in the kitchen. So the user needs to get to the kitchen. The kitchen is accessible from the Backyard via the screen door leading east, but that's closed. Wait, no, in the Backyard, the screen door is open leading west. Maybe that's a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go back to the kitchen through the wooden door they opened earlier. But the wooden door was in the bedroom, leading east. Hmm.

This is getting complicated. The user has to navigate through the rooms, pick up items, and use them. The main issue is that the user is stuck in a loop between the Garden and Backyard. The next step should be to go west from the Backyard, but the user hasn't tried that yet. So the correct command would be "go west" from the Backyard. But the user is in the Garden, so they need to go south to the Backyard, then west. But the user's last action was going south, which brought them back to the Garden. So the next step is to go west from the Backyard. But the user is in the Garden, so they need to go south again to reach the Backyard, then west. However, the user is in the Garden, so the next command should be "go south" to reach the Backyard, then "go west" from there. But the user is in the Garden, so the next action is "go south" again. But the user has been doing that repeatedly. Maybe the user needs to try a different approach. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go north from the Garden again, even though it leads back to the Backyard. But the user's goal is to place the bell pepper on the stove, which is in the kitchen. So the user needs to get to the kitchen. The kitchen is accessible from the Backyard via the screen door leading east, but that's closed. Wait, in the Backyard, the screen door is open leading west. Maybe that's a mistake in the game's description. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go back to the kitchen through the wooden door in the bedroom. But the user is in the Garden now. This is confusing. The user needs to find the correct path to the kitchen to place the bell pepper on the stove. The correct next step is probably to go west from the Backyard, but the user hasn't tried that yet. So the answer is "go west".

-= Backyard =-
You've just shown up in a backyard.

You can see a set of chairs. However, the set of chairs, like an empty set of chairs, has nothing on it. You move on, clearly done caring about TextWorld. You can make out a bbq. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can see a patio table. The patio table is typical. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is an open screen door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. It seems to be pretty usual here.

Were you looking for a refrigerator? Because look over there, it's a refrigerator. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. The counter appears to be empty. You scan the room, seeing a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is typical. On the kitchen island you make out a note. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.
