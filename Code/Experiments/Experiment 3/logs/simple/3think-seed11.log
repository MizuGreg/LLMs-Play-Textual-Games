Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First step, assure that the chest drawer within the bedroom is opened. And then, retrieve the old key from the chest drawer. After that, make absolutely sure that the wooden door in the bedroom is unlocked with the old key. After that, open the wooden door inside the bedroom. After that, attempt to travel east. Following that, ensure that the refrigerator in the kitchen is open. And then, take the lettuce from the refrigerator inside the kitchen. And then, rest the lettuce on the stove. Alright, thanks!

-= Bedroom =-
You've stumbled into a typical room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be typical. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the bedroom.

As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a chest drawer. You make out a closed antique trunk. You can see a king-size bed. But the thing is empty.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, let me see. The user has been following the steps to open the chest drawer, take the key, unlock the door, and now they've opened the door. The next step according to the original instructions was to open the wooden door inside the bedroom. Wait, the user just unlocked the door, so maybe the next step is to open it. But the user's last action was unlocking the door, and the score increased. Now, the next step in the original plan was to open the wooden door inside the bedroom. Wait, maybe the door is already open? Or maybe the user needs to open it after unlocking.

Wait, the user's last action was "unlock wooden door with old key", which was successful. The next step in the original instructions was "open the wooden door inside the bedroom." So the user needs to now open the door. So the next command should be "open wooden door". Then, after that, they need to attempt to travel east. So after opening the door, they can go east. Then, the next steps are to go to the kitchen, open the refrigerator, take lettuce, rest it on the stove.

So the next action here is to open the wooden door. The user has already unlocked it, but maybe it's still locked? Or maybe unlocking is different from opening. So the correct next step is to open the door. So the command should be "open wooden door".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in the TextWorld game. So far, they've opened the chest drawer, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door, and opened it. Then they tried to "travel east" but the system said that's not a recognized verb.

Hmm, the user is confused because they thought "travel east" was the correct command. But the game might be using different verbs. In text adventures, common commands are "go east", "move east", or "walk east". "Travel" might not be recognized as a valid verb here. So the correct command should be "go east" instead of "travel east".

The user's next action should be to use the correct verb. They need to "go east" to proceed. The score is at 4/5, so they're close. The next step after opening the door is to move east to the kitchen. The user might have made a mistake in the command, but the rest of the steps are correct. So the right command is "go east".

-= Kitchen =-
You've entered a kitchen. The room is well lit.

You make out a closed refrigerator right there by you. You make out a counter. But there isn't a thing on it. You make out a stove. The stove is standard. But there isn't a thing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an unguarded exit to the north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps to open the chest drawer, get the key, unlock and open the door, then go east to the kitchen. They opened the fridge, took the lettuce. Now they need to rest the lettuce on the stove.

The current location is the kitchen. The next step is to put the lettuce on the stove. The user has already taken the lettuce, so the next command should be to put it on the stove. The correct command would be "put lettuce on stove". Let me check if that's the right action. Yes, that makes sense. The user needs to rest the lettuce on the stove as part of the original goal. So the next action is to do that.
