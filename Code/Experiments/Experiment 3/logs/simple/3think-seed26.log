I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First off, open the antique trunk. After that, take the old key from the antique trunk inside the bedroom. Once you have picked up the old key, make it so that the wooden door is unlocked. After unlocking the wooden door, assure that the wooden door is opened. And then, make an attempt to go to the east. After that, look and see that the refrigerator is opened. After that, recover the lettuce from the refrigerator. If you can get your hands on the lettuce, put the lettuce on the stove. Got that? Good!

-= Bedroom =-
You arrive in a bedroom. A typical one.

You can make out a closed chest drawer. You scan the room for an antique trunk, and you find an antique trunk. You check the price tag that's still affixed to the antique trunk. Eighty bucks?! That's ridiculous! Do you know my good friend, they work for the government? I'm sure my friend could get you one of those for 45 bucks! You can see a king-size bed. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me see. The user has been following the steps to open the antique trunk, take the old key, unlock the wooden door, and now they've done that. The next step according to the original task was to assure the wooden door is opened. So after unlocking, they need to open it.

Wait, the user just unlocked the door, so the next command should be to open the door. The previous action was "unlock wooden door with old key", and the response was "You unlock wooden door." So now, the next step is to open it. The user's next action should be "open wooden door".

Then, after opening the door, they need to go to the east. So after opening the door, they should "go east". Then check the refrigerator, open it, take the lettuce, put it on the stove. But the current step is to first open the door. So the next command is "open wooden door".

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a typical kind of place. That is to say, you're in a kitchen.

If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a refrigerator. You can make out a counter. The counter is standard. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. This always happens, here in TextWorld! What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. Look over there! a kitchen island. On the kitchen island you can see a note. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

Okay, let me think through this. The user has been following the steps correctly so far. They opened the antique trunk, took the old key, unlocked the wooden door, opened it, went east to the kitchen, and now opened the refrigerator. The next step was to recover the lettuce from the refrigerator. The user just opened the fridge and found a lettuce and a tomato plant. So the next action should be to take the lettuce.

Wait, the original task said "recover the lettuce from the refrigerator." So after opening the fridge, they need to pick up the lettuce. The user's last action was opening the refrigerator, so the next command should be "take lettuce from refrigerator" or something similar. But in the game's context, maybe it's just "take lettuce" if it's in the fridge. Let me check the previous interactions. The user said "open refrigerator" and the response was that there's a lettuce and a tomato plant. So the next step is to take the lettuce. The user needs to take it from the refrigerator. So the correct command would be "take lettuce from refrigerator". But the system might expect a shorter command. Alternatively, maybe just "take lettuce" if the game recognizes it as being in the fridge. But to be precise, since the fridge is open and the lettuce is there, the user should take it. So the next action is to take the lettuce from the refrigerator.
