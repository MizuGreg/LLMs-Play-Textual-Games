Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First, it would be great if you could assure that the chest drawer is ajar. Then, take the old key from the chest drawer. If you can get your hands on the old key, unlock the wooden door. And then, make it so that the wooden door is ajar. And then, move east. With that over with, ensure that the screen door is open. And then, make an attempt to move east. Next, go to the south. After that, lift the lettuce from the floor of the garden. After that, go north. Okay, and then, venture west. That done, rest the lettuce on the stove. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Bedroom =-
You're now in the bedroom. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You can make out a closed chest drawer. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than an antique trunk, so there's that. You scan the room, seeing a king-size bed. The king-size bed is typical. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me see. The user has been following the steps given in the initial instructions. They started by opening the chest drawer, taking the old key, unlocking the wooden door, and then the next step was to make the wooden door ajar. Wait, but they just unlocked it, so maybe that's already done. Then they need to move east. The user's next action after unlocking the door would be to move east. But the current prompt shows that the wooden door is unlocked, so the next step is to go east. Let me check the previous steps again.

The user's instructions said: after unlocking the door, make sure it's ajar (which unlocking should do), then move east. So the next command should be "go east". The user has already unlocked the door, so moving east is the next logical step. The response should be "go east".

-= Kitchen =-
You've come into an ordinary room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be ordinary. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the kitchen. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You make out a refrigerator. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a counter, go to TextWorld. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Were you looking for a stove? Because look over there, it's a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? The stove appears to be empty. You move on, clearly infuriated by TextWorld. You scan the room for a kitchen island, and you find a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the kitchen now. The original goal was to get the lettuce from the garden, rest it on the stove, and win. So far, they've opened the chest drawer, taken the key, unlocked the door, opened the wooden door, and moved east to the kitchen. The next steps according to the initial instructions were to ensure the screen door is open, then move east again, then go south, pick up the lettuce, go north, venture west, and rest the lettuce on the stove.

In the current kitchen scene, there's a closed screen door leading east. The user's next step should be to open that screen door. But wait, the user's previous action was moving east to the kitchen. Now, the screen door is east here. So maybe the user needs to open the screen door first. But the initial instructions said to ensure the screen door is open before moving east. Wait, the user just moved into the kitchen, and the screen door is east. So maybe the next step is to open the screen door. But the user's next action should be to open the screen door. However, the user's current location is the kitchen, and the screen door is east. So the command would be "open screen door". But the user's next action after moving east was to open the screen door. Let me check the initial instructions again.

The original steps were: after moving east, ensure the screen door is open, then move east again. Wait, the user is in the kitchen now. The screen door is east here. So the user needs to open it. Then, after that, move east again. But the user's next action should be to open the screen door. So the correct command is "open screen door".

Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a patio table. The patio table is usual. But the thing is empty. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is an open screen door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

Okay, the user is in the Garden now. The original goal was to lift the lettuce from the floor of the garden, then go north, venture west, and rest the lettuce on the stove. So far, they've opened the screen door, moved east to the backyard, then south to the garden. Now, they need to pick up the lettuce. The current scene shows the lettuce on the floor. So the next action should be to pick up the lettuce. The command would be "take lettuce".

Okay, the user has picked up the lettuce and gone north back to the backyard. The next step according to the original plan was to venture west after lifting the lettuce. But in the current scene, the user is in the backyard, and the screen door is open leading west. So the next action should be to go west. But wait, the original instructions said after going north, venture west. So the command would be "go west". However, the user is currently in the backyard, and the screen door is west. So moving west would take them back to the kitchen or another area. But the goal is to rest the lettuce on the stove. The stove is in the kitchen. So after going west, they might need to go north again to reach the kitchen. Wait, but the user just came from the garden to the backyard. The stove is in the kitchen, which is east of the backyard. So maybe the user needs to go east again. But the screen door is west here. Hmm, maybe the user needs to go south from the backyard to the kitchen. Wait, the backyard has an unblocked exit to the south. So perhaps the user should go south to the kitchen, then go north to the stove. But the original plan was to go north, then west. Maybe the user is supposed to go west from the backyard to the kitchen. Wait, the kitchen is east of the backyard. So maybe the user needs to go east. But the screen door is west. This is a bit confusing. Let me check the previous steps again.
