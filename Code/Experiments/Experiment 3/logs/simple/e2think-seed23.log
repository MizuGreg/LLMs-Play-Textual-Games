You are now playing a profound session of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First of all, ensure that the antique trunk is open. And then, recover the old key from the antique trunk in the bedroom. Then, check that the wooden door is unlocked with the old key. Then, open the wooden door. And then, move east. And then, make absolutely sure that the screen door is open. Having opened the screen door, attempt to head east. With that done, move south. Then, retrieve the apple from the floor of the garden. And then, make an attempt to venture north. If you can succeed at that, head west. With that accomplished, sit the apple on the stove inside the kitchen. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Bedroom =-
Well, here we are in a bedroom.

You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a chest drawer, so there's that. You make out a closed antique trunk in the corner. You make out a king-size bed. The king-size bed is typical. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text adventure game. The goal is to follow a series of steps to win. So far, they've opened the antique trunk and found an old key inside. But when they tried to "recover old key from antique trunk," the game didn't recognize that as a valid command.

Hmm, maybe the correct command is just "take old key" or "get old key" instead of "recover." Since the trunk is already open, the key is inside. The player needs to pick it up. The game's response was confused because "recover" isn't a standard verb here. So the next step should be to take the key from the trunk.

Wait, the user's previous action was "recover old key from antique trunk," which the game rejected. The correct action is probably "take old key" or "get old key." Let me check the game's possible commands. In TextWorld, common verbs are "take," "get," "use," "open," "close," etc. So the right command here is to take the key.

So the next action should be "take old key" or "get old key." But the user might have used "recover" instead of "take." So the correct command is "take old key." Let me make sure that's the right move. Once the key is taken, the next step is to unlock the wooden door with it. So after taking the key, the player should use it on the door.

Okay, let's see. The user has successfully unlocked the wooden door with the old key. The next step according to the original plan was to open the wooden door. Wait, but they just unlocked it, so maybe they need to open it now. But the command "unlock" might have already done that. Hmm, maybe the next step is to move east as mentioned in the initial instructions.

Wait, the user's previous action was "unlock wooden door with old key," which worked. Now, the next step in the plan was to "open the wooden door." But if it's already unlocked, maybe "open" is the next command. Or perhaps "move east" since the door leads east. Let me check the original steps again.

Original steps: After unlocking the door, open it, then move east. So after unlocking, the next command should be "open wooden door." But the user might have already done that. Wait, the user's current location is the bedroom, and the wooden door leads east. So after unlocking, they need to open it, then move east. But the game might require them to open the door first. So the next command should be "open wooden door." But the user just unlocked it, so maybe "open" is the correct next step. Alternatively, maybe "move east" is the next step. But the instructions say to open the door first. So the correct next action is "open wooden door."

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Kitchen now. The previous steps were opening the wooden door and moving east, which led here. The goal is to retrieve the apple from the garden, then go north, west, sit the apple on the stove, and win.

In the kitchen, there's a note on the kitchen island. The exits are screen door east, wooden door west, and unblocked exits north and south. The user needs to proceed according to the plan: after opening the screen door and moving east, then move south. Wait, the original steps said after opening the screen door, attempt to head east, then move south. Wait, the current location is the kitchen. The next step after moving east from the bedroom was to make sure the screen door is open, then head east, then move south. But the user is now in the kitchen. The screen door is leading east, so maybe they need to open it first. Wait, the screen door is mentioned as closed leading east. Wait, looking at the description: "There is a closed screen door leading east." So the user needs to open the screen door first. Then, after opening it, head east. Then move south. But the user's next action should be to open the screen door. Wait, but the user just arrived here via the wooden door. The next step in the plan was to make sure the screen door is open, then head east. So the correct action here is to open the screen door. Then, after that, move east. So the next command should be "open screen door".

So the correct action here is to "go south" to reach the garden where the apple is located. Once there, they can pick up the apple. Then, after retrieving it, they need to venture north, then west, and sit the apple on the stove. So the next command should be "go south".

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Backyard again after moving west. The goal is to sit the apple on the stove in the kitchen. The previous steps were retrieving the apple from the garden, moving north, then west. Now, they need to get back to the kitchen. The current location is the Backyard, and there's an exit to the south leading back to the Garden, and a screen door west leading back to the Kitchen. Wait, the user just came from the Garden via north, then west to Backyard. Now, to get back to the Kitchen, maybe they need to go west again? Or perhaps there's another path. But the current exits are south and west. The Kitchen is west, so maybe the next step is to go west again. But the user already did that. Wait, the user's last action was "go west" from the Backyard, but the game didn't respond. Maybe the correct command is to go west again to reach the Kitchen. Alternatively, maybe they need to go south to the Garden and then back to the Kitchen. But the plan says after moving north and west, sit the apple on the stove. Wait, the stove is in the Kitchen. So the user needs to be in the Kitchen to sit the apple on the stove. So from the Backyard, the screen door west leads back to the Kitchen. So the next action should be "go west" again to reach the Kitchen. Then, once in the Kitchen, sit the apple on the stove. So the correct command here is "go west".

Okay, the user is stuck in the Backyard, trying to get to the Kitchen. They've tried "go west" but the game isn't responding. Let me check the previous steps. The user was in the Garden, took the apple, went north to Backyard, then tried to go west. The Backyard's description says there's an open screen door leading west, which should lead back to the Kitchen. Maybe the correct command is "go west" again. But the game is rejecting it. Wait, maybe the user needs to "open" the screen door again? But it's already open. Alternatively, maybe the command is "exit west" or "move west". But the game expects "go west". The user has tried "go west" twice, and the game is still not accepting it. Maybe there's a typo or the game is expecting a different verb. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "enter" the west door. But the correct command is likely "go west". Since the user is following the plan, the next step is to go west again to reach the Kitchen and then sit the apple on the stove. So the answer is "go west".
