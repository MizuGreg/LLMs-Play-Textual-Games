You are now playing a profound game of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to open the antique trunk in the bedroom. After that, pick up the old key from the antique trunk. After picking up the old key, assure that the wooden door is unlocked. And then, open the wooden door inside the bedroom. And then, attempt to go east. Following that, go to the south. Then, recover the apple from the couch in the living room. After that, try to venture north. After that, put the apple on the stove. Got that? Good!

-= Bedroom =-
Well, here we are in a bedroom.

You see a closed chest drawer. You see a closed antique trunk in the room. You can see a king-size bed. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hopefully, this discovery doesn't ruin your TextWorld experience!

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me see. The user has been following the steps to open the antique trunk, pick up the key, and now they need to unlock the wooden door. The next step in the instructions was to "assure that the wooden door is unlocked." So, after picking up the key, the next logical action would be to use the key to unlock the door.

Wait, but the user just picked up the key, so they need to go to the wooden door and unlock it. The current location is the bedroom, and the wooden door leading east is closed. The user has to unlock it. Since they have the key, they should try to unlock the door. The command would be "unlock wooden door" or something similar. But in TextWorld, the exact phrasing might matter. Let me check the previous commands. The user was told to "assure that the wooden door is unlocked," so maybe the correct action is to unlock it. But the user has the key, so they need to use it on the door. The correct command would be "unlock wooden door" or "use key on wooden door." But in the game's context, maybe "unlock wooden door" is the right command. Let me make sure. The previous actions were "open antique trunk" and "pick up old key," so the next step is to unlock the door. The user is in the bedroom, and the door is leading east. So the next action should be to unlock the door. The command would be "unlock wooden door." But the user might need to first go to the door. Wait, the door is in the room, so maybe they can unlock it directly. But the game might require the user to be near the door. However, the user is in the bedroom, and the door is part of the room. So the correct action is to unlock the wooden door. Let me confirm. The user has the key, so they can unlock the door. The next step is to unlock the door. So the command is "unlock wooden door."

Okay, let's see. The user has successfully opened the antique trunk, picked up the old key, unlocked the wooden door, and opened it. The next step in the original task was to "attempt to go east" after opening the door. Since the wooden door was leading east, once it's open, the user should be able to go east. So the next action should be "go east". Let me check the previous steps again. After opening the door, the user is now in the room beyond the door. The next instruction says "attempt to go east. Following that, go to the south." So after going east, they need to go south. But the current location is the bedroom, and after opening the door, they would be in the next room, maybe the living room? Wait, the original task said after opening the wooden door inside the bedroom, then go east, then south. So the user is in the bedroom, opened the door, and now needs to go east. So the next command is "go east".

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. An usual one. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You can make out a refrigerator. You see a counter. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the counter. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove! The stove is ordinary. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a kitchen island. You shudder, but continue examining the kitchen island. The kitchen island is normal. On the kitchen island you can make out a note. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this!

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an unguarded exit to the north. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

You are in a living room. An ordinary kind of place.

You can see a couch. The couch is standard. On the couch you can see an apple. You smell a great smell, and follow it to a low table. On the low table you see a remote. You can make out a tv. The tv is typical. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

Okay, let's recap the user's progress so far. They started in the bedroom, opened the antique trunk, picked up the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door leading east, which took them to the kitchen. From the kitchen, they went south to the living room. Now, in the living room, they need to recover the apple from the couch and then put it on the stove.

The current step is to recover the apple. The user has the apple on the couch, so the next action should be to pick up the apple. After that, they need to go north as per the instructions, but first, the apple must be picked up. The user's next move should be to take the apple from the couch. The command would be "pick up apple" or "take apple". Since the game uses "pick up" previously, it's safer to use that. Once the apple is picked up, they can proceed to the next steps, which include putting it on the stove. But the immediate next action is to retrieve the apple.

Okay, let's see. The user has picked up the apple and gone north. The next step according to the original goal was to "put the apple on the stove." So now, after going north, they need to find the stove and place the apple there. The current location is north of the living room, which might be the kitchen again since the kitchen had a stove. But earlier, when they were in the kitchen, the stove was empty. So the user needs to go back to the kitchen, maybe through the screen door east, and then put the apple on the stove. But the user is in the living room now, so they need to go north again to reach the kitchen. Wait, the previous action was "go north" from the living room, which led them to the kitchen. But the score was at 7/9, so maybe they are in the kitchen again. Then the next step is to put the apple on the stove. The command would be "put apple on stove" or "put apple on stove". Since the game requires exact commands, "put apple on stove" is the right action here.

Okay, let's recap the user's progress. They started in the bedroom, opened the trunk, got the key, unlocked and opened the door east to the kitchen. Then they went south to the living room, picked up the apple, went north back to the kitchen. Now, they're in the kitchen again, and the next step is to put the apple on the stove. But in the kitchen, the stove is empty. The user has the apple, so they need to place it on the stove. The correct command would be "put apple on stove". However, in the previous interaction, when they tried to put the apple on the stove, the game didn't respond, but the user continued. Now, after going south again, they're back in the kitchen.

Okay, let's see. The user has been moving around the rooms, picking up items, and following the steps given. The original goal was to open the trunk, get the key, unlock and open the door, then go east, south, retrieve the apple, put it on the stove. Now, they're in the living room again after going north. The next step would be to check if the apple is on the stove. But in the previous step, they tried to put the apple on the stove in the kitchen and failed. Wait, maybe the apple is still in their inventory. Since they picked it up in the living room, they should have it. So now, after going back to the living room, they need to go back to the kitchen again to put the apple on the stove. But the user is in the living room, so the next action should be to go north again to reach the kitchen. Then, put the apple on the stove. But the user just went north again, so maybe the next command is "put apple on stove" in the kitchen. But the current location is the living room. Wait, the last action was "go north" from the living room, which brings them back to the kitchen. So the next step is to put the apple on the stove. The correct command is "put apple on stove".
