You are now playing a life changing session of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First thing I need you to do is to assure that the chest drawer in the bedroom is open. Then, retrieve the old key from the chest drawer in the bedroom. After that, unlock the wooden door with the old key. And then, ensure that the wooden door in the bedroom is open. After that, make an attempt to move east. Following that, open the refrigerator. And then, pick up the apple from the refrigerator. After that, rest the apple on the stove. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Bedroom =-
You are in a bedroom. A normal one. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You make out a chest drawer. You can make out an antique trunk. You smell a wretched smell, and follow it to a king-size bed. The king-size bed is standard. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing a text-based game where they need to follow a series of steps to win. The current situation is in the bedroom. The user first tried to "open chest drawer", which worked. Then they tried "retrieve old key from chest drawer", but the system said that's not a recognized verb.

Hmm, so maybe the correct command isn't "retrieve" but something else. In text adventures, common verbs are "take", "get", "pick up", etc. Since the key is in the chest drawer, after opening it, the user should use "take" or "get" to pick up the key. The previous attempt used "retrieve", which might not be a valid command here. The system's response indicates that "retrieve" isn't a recognized verb, so the user needs to use the correct command.

The user is asking if they're on the right track and what their next action should be. The next step after getting the key is to unlock the wooden door with the key. But first, they need to pick up the key correctly. So the correct action here is to "take old key from chest drawer" or "get old key from chest drawer". Since the system might expect "take", that's probably the right command. Then, after getting the key, they can use it to unlock the door. So the next action should be "take old key from chest drawer".

Okay, let's see. The user has successfully unlocked the wooden door. The next step according to the original plan was to ensure the wooden door is open. Since they just unlocked it, maybe they need to open it further or check if it's open. But in text adventures, sometimes "open" is a verb that needs to be used. Alternatively, maybe the door is already open after unlocking. Wait, the original instructions said "ensure that the wooden door in the bedroom is open" after unlocking it. So perhaps the user needs to explicitly open it again. But maybe "unlock" and "open" are different actions. Let me check the previous steps.

The user unlocked the door with the key. The next step was to ensure it's open. So maybe the correct command is "open wooden door". Alternatively, since it's already unlocked, maybe it's open. But the instruction says to "ensure" it's open, so perhaps the user needs to use the "open" command. Let me think. In many text games, you have to use "open" to open a door, even if it's already unlocked. So the next action should be "open wooden door".

Okay, the user has moved east. The next step according to the original plan was to open the refrigerator. So the next action should be "open refrigerator". Let me check if that's the correct command. The user is in a new room after moving east, so they need to find the refrigerator and open it. The command "open refrigerator" makes sense here. So the next action is to open the refrigerator.

-= Kitchen =-
Ah, the kitchen. This is some kind of kitchen, really great standard vibes in this place, a wonderful standard atmosphere. And now, well, you're in it.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a refrigerator. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. The counter appears to be empty. You see a stove. The stove is usual. But there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is standard. On the kitchen island you see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

Okay, the user tried to "pick up apple from refrigerator" but couldn't see an apple. Let me check the previous steps. The user opened the refrigerator, but according to the description, the counter is empty. The refrigerator might not have an apple. Wait, the original plan was to pick up an apple from the refrigerator. But in the current room (kitchen), the user saw a note on the kitchen island. Maybe the apple is not in the refrigerator. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to look elsewhere. But according to the game's current state, the refrigerator is empty. So the correct action would be to check another place. However, the next step in the original plan was to pick up the apple from the refrigerator. Since that's not possible, maybe the user needs to look for the apple elsewhere. But the game's description doesn't mention an apple in the kitchen. Wait, maybe the apple is on the stove? The stove is usual but empty. Or maybe the note on the kitchen island has the apple? The user hasn't checked that. But the instructions said to pick up the apple from the refrigerator. Since that's not possible, maybe the user needs to look for the apple elsewhere. However, the game's current state doesn't mention an apple. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the previous step. The correct action would be to check the kitchen island for the apple. But the original plan was to pick it from the refrigerator. Maybe the user needs to look for the apple in the kitchen island. But the user's next action should be to check the kitchen island. However, the game's current state says the kitchen island has a note. Maybe the apple is on the kitchen island. So the user should check there. But the original plan was to pick it from the refrigerator. This is confusing. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to look for the apple in the refrigerator again. But the game says the counter is empty. So perhaps the user needs to check the stove or the kitchen island. Since the user can't pick it from the refrigerator, the next action should be to check the kitchen island. But the user's next command should be to "pick up apple from kitchen island" or something similar. However, the game might not have that. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to look for the apple in the refrigerator again. But the game says the counter is empty. So maybe the user made a mistake in the previous steps. The correct action is to check the kitchen island for the apple. So the next command should be "look kitchen island" or "check kitchen island". But the user's previous action was "pick up apple from refrigerator", which failed. So the next step is to check the kitchen island. But the user's next action should be "look kitchen island" or "check kitchen island". However, the game might require a different command. Alternatively, maybe the apple is on the stove. But the stove is empty. So the user needs to check the note on the kitchen island. The note might have the apple. So the next action is to "pick up note from kitchen island" and then check the note. But the original plan was to pick up the apple from the refrigerator. This is a problem. The user needs to follow the original steps, but the game's current state doesn't have the apple in the refrigerator. So maybe the user needs to check the kitchen island for the apple. The correct command would be "look kitchen island" or "check kitchen island". But the user's next action should be to do that. So the answer is "look kitchen island".

Okay, the user tried to pick up the note from the kitchen island, but the game didn't recognize it. The previous step was looking at the kitchen island, which has a note. The correct action should be to pick up the note. But the user's command was "pick up note from kitchen island", which the game didn't understand. Maybe the correct command is just "pick up note" without specifying the location, since the note is already in the kitchen island. Alternatively, the game might require the user to use the correct verb. The original plan was to pick up the apple from the refrigerator, but that didn't work. Now, after picking up the note, maybe the next step is to check the note's content for clues about the apple. But the user's next action should be to pick up the note correctly. So the command should be "pick up note".

Okay, the user is trying to put the apple on the stove but keeps getting "You can't see any such thing." The previous steps showed that the stove is usual but empty. The note mentioned the apple is missing for the dinner. Maybe the apple is already on the stove, but the user isn't seeing it. Alternatively, the apple might be in another location. Wait, the user picked up the note from the kitchen island. The note said the apple is missing for the dinner. Maybe the apple is on the stove, but the user needs to use the correct command. The correct verb might be "place" instead of "put". Let me check the possible commands. In text adventures, "put" is commonly used. But the game might require "place". Alternatively, the apple is not visible because it's hidden. The user needs to check the stove again. The next action should be to "put apple on stove" again, even though it's not working. Maybe the game is expecting a different command. Alternatively, the apple is already on the stove, and the user needs to confirm. But the user can't see it. Maybe the correct command is "place apple on stove". Let me try that.
