I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First off, ensure that the antique trunk within the bedroom is open. After that, recover the old key from the antique trunk. After that, make it so that the wooden door in the bedroom is unlocked with the old key. And then, make absolutely sure that the wooden door inside the bedroom is ajar. After opening the wooden door, go east. Then, doublecheck that the screen door is wide open. And then, attempt to travel east. And then, try to travel south. With that done, lift the milk from the floor of the garden. After stealing the milk, head north. And then, attempt to travel west. With that done, rest the milk on the stove. That's it!

-= Bedroom =-
I am sorry to announce that you are now in the bedroom. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a chest drawer. You scan the room for an antique trunk, and you find an antique trunk. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to a king-size bed. The king-size bed is standard. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. You think about smashing the king-size bed to bits, throwing the bits in the dump, etc, until you get bored.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in the game because they can't find the milk in the garden. They tried taking the milk from the floor multiple times, but it didn't work. Let me check the previous steps to understand the context.

First, the user had to open the antique trunk, get the key, unlock and open the wooden door, then go east to the kitchen, open the screen door, go east again to the backyard, then south to the garden. In the garden, the description says there's a milk, a half bag of chips, lettuce, and a shovel on the floor. But when the user tried to take the milk, it said "You can't see any such thing." That's confusing because the description explicitly mentions the milk is there.

Wait, maybe the milk is not visible because it's under something else? Or maybe the user needs to pick it up correctly. The command "take milk from floor" might not be the right syntax. In TextWorld, sometimes you just say "take milk" without specifying the location if it's in the current room. Let me check the game's possible commands. The user is in the garden, and the milk is on the floor. So perhaps the correct command is simply "take milk" instead of specifying the floor. Let me try that. If the game allows taking the milk directly, then that would work. Alternatively, maybe the milk is in a different location, but the description says it's on the floor. So the next action should be to take the milk without specifying the floor, then proceed to the next steps.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to complete a series of tasks in TextWorld. They've already done most of the steps: opened the trunk, took the key, unlocked the door, opened it, went east to the kitchen, checked the screen door, went east to the backyard, then south to the garden where they took the milk. Now they need to rest the milk on the stove.

But in the backyard, there's no stove mentioned. The user tried "put milk on stove" multiple times, but it's not working. The current location is the backyard, which has a screen door west and an exit south. The stove is in the kitchen, but they're in the backyard now. So maybe they need to go back to the kitchen to put the milk on the stove. But the user is at the backyard, so the correct action would be to go north back to the kitchen. Then, once in the kitchen, they can put the milk on the stove. However, the user's last action was trying to put the milk in the backyard, which doesn't have a stove. So the next step should be to go back to the kitchen and then put the milk on the stove there. But the user is in the backyard, so the immediate next action is to go north to the kitchen. Then, in the kitchen, they can put the milk on the stove. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the correct command here is to go north to the kitchen, then put the milk on the stove. But since the user is in the backyard, the next step is to go north.

Of every kitchen you could have sauntered into, you had to walk into an ordinary one. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You can see a closed refrigerator in the room. You can make out a counter. The counter is usual. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. You scan the room, seeing a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. You can see a kitchen island. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? On the kitchen island you can see a note.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.
