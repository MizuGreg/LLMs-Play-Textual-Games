You are now playing a exciting game of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First stop, assure that the chest drawer in the bedroom is wide open. And then, pick up the old key from the chest drawer inside the bedroom. Then, check that the wooden door is unlocked with the old key. After unlocking the wooden door, assure that the wooden door is wide open. After that, head east. Then, ensure that the screen door in the kitchen is open. Then, make an attempt to move east. With that accomplished, make an attempt to head south. Then, pick-up the lettuce from the floor of the garden. Then, travel north. Then, try to take a trip west. Then, rest the lettuce on the stove inside the kitchen. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Bedroom =-
You arrive in a bedroom. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You make out a chest drawer. What's that over there? It looks like it's an antique trunk. Were you looking for a king-size bed? Because look over there, it's a king-size bed. The king-size bed is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me see. The user has already opened the chest drawer and picked up the old key. The next step according to the task was to check that the wooden door is unlocked with the old key. So now, they need to use the key to unlock the door.

Wait, the current location is the bedroom. The wooden door leading east is closed. The user has the old key, so they should try to unlock the door with it. The command would be to unlock the door with the key. But in the game's context, maybe the action is to use the key on the door. So the next action should be to unlock the wooden door with the old key. Then, after unlocking, they need to make sure the door is wide open. So after unlocking, they might need to open it further. But the exact commands depend on the game's possible actions. Since the user has the key, the next step is to use it on the door. So the correct command here is "unlock wooden door with old key".

Okay, let's see. The user has successfully unlocked and opened the wooden door leading east. The next step in the original task was to "head east" after ensuring the door is open. So now, they should move east. The command would be "go east". That's the next logical step after opening the door. Let me make sure there are no other steps in between. The task said after unlocking and opening the door, head east. So "go east" is the next action.

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.

You see a closed refrigerator. What's that over there? It looks like it's a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is ordinary. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. What's the point of an empty counter? You can see a stove. The stove is usual. The stove appears to be empty. You see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is standard. On the kitchen island you make out a note. Hmmm... what else, what else?

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the bathroom now. The previous steps were going north from the kitchen, which led here. The task was to follow a series of steps: after opening the door east from the bedroom, go east to the kitchen, then check the screen door in the kitchen, try to move east, then south, etc. But the user is in the bathroom now. The current location is the bathroom, and the possible exits are south (back to the kitchen) or maybe other directions. The user's next action should be to go south to return to the kitchen. Because the next step in the original task was after moving east from the kitchen, then trying to move south. But since the user is in the bathroom, perhaps they need to go back to the kitchen. The correct next command would be "go south" to return to the kitchen.

Okay, let's see. The user has been moving through different rooms: bedroom, kitchen, bathroom, now living room. The original task was to follow a specific sequence of actions. Let me recap the steps:

1. Open chest drawer in bedroom, pick up old key.
2. Unlock and open wooden door east (leading to kitchen).
3. Check screen door in kitchen, try to move east (but maybe that's already done?).
4. Then move south, pick up lettuce in garden, travel north, west, rest lettuce on stove in kitchen.

Wait, the user is in the living room now. The next step according to the task was after moving east from the kitchen, then try to move south. But the user is in the living room, which is north of the kitchen. So maybe the next step is to go north again? Or perhaps the user needs to go west from the living room back to the kitchen. But the living room's exits are north (unblocked) and maybe others. The current prompt says "You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north." So the next action should be "go north" to proceed further. But the original task after the kitchen was to move south, but maybe the user is getting lost. However, the game's current state says the living room has an unblocked north exit. So the correct next step is to go north again. But the user's task was to move south after certain steps. Maybe the user is going in circles. However, the game's logic might require proceeding north. So the next command is "go north".

Okay, let's try to figure out what's going on here. The user is in a loop between the kitchen and the living room, going back and forth. The original task was to follow specific steps: after unlocking the door and opening it, go east, check the screen door in the kitchen, try to move east, then south, pick up lettuce in the garden, etc. But the user has been moving north and south between the kitchen and living room, which might not be part of the original plan.

The current location is the living room, and the next action suggested is to go north again. However, the user's task was to move south after certain steps. Maybe the user is stuck in a cycle because the game's environment is structured in a way that moving north from the living room leads back to the kitchen, and then south again. But the original goal required moving to the garden to pick up lettuce. So perhaps the user hasn't reached the garden yet.

Wait, the task mentioned after moving east from the kitchen, try to move south. But the user is in the living room now. Maybe the user needs to find the garden. However, the current rooms listed are kitchen, bathroom, living room, bedroom, etc. The garden hasn't been visited yet. So perhaps the user needs to find another exit leading to the garden. But in the current setup, the exits from the kitchen are east (screen door), west (open door), north (unblocked), and south (unguarded). The living room's exit is north. Maybe the user needs to go east from the kitchen through the screen door to reach the garden. But the screen door is closed. The user might need to open it. However, the original task didn't mention opening the screen door, just checking it. But the user's previous actions were to check the screen door in the kitchen. Wait, the original task said: "ensure that the screen door in the kitchen is open. Then, make an attempt to move east." So maybe the user needs to open the screen door first. But in the current state, the screen door is closed. So the next step should be to open it. But the user hasn't done that yet. However, the user is currently in the kitchen, and the screen door is leading east. So the correct next action would be to open the screen door. But the user's last action was going south, leading back to the living room. So maybe the user needs to go back to the kitchen, open the screen door, then move east to the garden. But the user is in the living room again. So the next step is to go north to the kitchen, then open the screen door, then move east. But the user's current position is the living room, so the next command should be "go north" to return to the kitchen. Then, open the screen door. But the user's last action was "go south", which brought them back to the living room. So the next action is "go north" again to get back to the kitchen. Then, open the screen door. But the user's task was to check the screen door and try to move east. So maybe the user needs to open the screen door first. However, the game might require the user to attempt to move east even if the door is closed. But the original task says "ensure that the screen door is open" and then "make an attempt to move east". So the user needs to open the door first. But in the current state, the screen door is closed. So the next action should be to open it. But the user is in the living room, so they need to go back to the kitchen first. Therefore, the correct next command is "go north" to return to the kitchen, then "open screen door". But the user is in the living room, so the next step is "go north".

Okay, let's see. The user has opened the screen door in the kitchen. The next step according to the original task was to "make an attempt to move east" after ensuring the screen door is open. So now that the door is open, the user should try to go east. The command would be "go east". That makes sense because the screen door leading east is now open, so moving east should be possible.

Let me check the previous steps to confirm. Yes, after traveling north from the garden, the next step is to try to go west. So the correct command is "go west".

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.

You see a closed refrigerator. What's that over there? It looks like it's a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is ordinary. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. What's the point of an empty counter? You can see a stove. The stove is usual. The stove appears to be empty. You see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is standard. On the kitchen island you make out a note. Hmmm... what else, what else?

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

<think>
Okay, the user tried to "rest lettuce on stove" but the game didn't recognize it. The correct command should be "put lettuce on stove". Let me check the possible actions. The task says to "rest the lettuce on the stove inside the kitchen". So the correct verb is "put". Therefore, the next action is "put lettuce on stove".
