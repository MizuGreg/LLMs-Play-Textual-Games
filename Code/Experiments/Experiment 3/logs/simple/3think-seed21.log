You are now playing a profound game of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to open the antique trunk in the bedroom. After that, pick up the old key from the antique trunk. After picking up the old key, assure that the wooden door is unlocked. And then, open the wooden door inside the bedroom. And then, attempt to go east. Following that, go to the south. Then, recover the apple from the couch in the living room. After that, try to venture north. After that, put the apple on the stove. Got that? Good!

-= Bedroom =-
Well, here we are in a bedroom.

You see a closed chest drawer. You see a closed antique trunk in the room. You can see a king-size bed. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hopefully, this discovery doesn't ruin your TextWorld experience!

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps correctly so far. They opened the antique trunk, picked up the old key, unlocked the wooden door, and now the next step is to open the wooden door. Wait, the previous action was unlocking the door, so the next logical step would be to open it. But the user's last action was unlocking, and the score is at 3/4. The original goal mentioned opening the wooden door inside the bedroom. Wait, maybe the door was closed and needs to be opened. Let me check the previous messages.

In the initial description, the bedroom has a closed wooden door leading east. The user unlocked it, so now they need to open it. But maybe the door is locked and requires the key to open. Wait, the user already unlocked it with the key. So the next step is to open the door. But the user's last action was unlocking, so the next command should be "open wooden door". Then, after opening, they need to go east, then south, etc. The user's next action should be to open the door. Let me confirm the steps again.

Original task: Open trunk, pick up key, unlock door, open door, go east, south, recover apple, put on stove. So after unlocking, the next step is to open the door. So the correct command here is "open wooden door".

You find yourself in a kitchen. An usual one. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You can make out a refrigerator. You see a counter. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the counter. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove! The stove is ordinary. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a kitchen island. You shudder, but continue examining the kitchen island. The kitchen island is normal. On the kitchen island you can make out a note. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this!

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an unguarded exit to the north. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

The tv is typical. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

Okay, let's see. The user has been following a series of steps in the TextWorld game. They started in the bedroom, opened the antique trunk, picked up the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, then went east to the kitchen, south to the living room. Now, in the living room, they need to recover the apple from the couch and then put it on the stove.

The current location is the Living Room. The user's next step, according to the original task, was to "recover the apple from the couch in the living room." So the next action should be to pick up the apple. After that, they need to go north, then put the apple on the stove. But the user's next move should be to pick up the apple first. The response should be "pick up apple" to follow the sequence correctly.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following a series of steps in this text-based game. Their goal was to open the antique trunk, get the key, unlock and open the wooden door, go east, south, retrieve the apple from the couch, then put it on the stove.

So far, they've managed to get the apple from the couch (step 7/8). Then they went north, which took them back to the kitchen (step 7/9), and then south again to the living room (step 7/10). Now, the next step according to the original plan was to put the apple on the stove. 

But in the current scene, they're back in the living room. The stove was in the kitchen. So the user needs to go back to the kitchen, maybe through the west door (since the kitchen has an open wooden door leading west from the kitchen, but when they were in the kitchen earlier, they came from the living room via the west door). Wait, the current location is the living room, so to get to the kitchen, they would go west. Once in the kitchen, they can go north to the bedroom again? Wait, no. The user's next step is to put the apple on the stove. The stove is in the kitchen. So they need to go to the kitchen, then find the stove and place the apple there.

But in the current state, the user is in the living room. The previous action was going south from the kitchen to the living room. So to get back to the kitchen, they need to go west. Then, once in the kitchen, they can go north to the bedroom again? Wait, no. The kitchen's exits are east (screen door), west (open wooden door), and north (unguarded exit). Wait, in the kitchen description, there's an unguarded exit to the north. So maybe the kitchen is connected to another room north of it. But the user's goal is to put the apple on the stove in the kitchen. So once they are in the kitchen, they need to go to the stove. But in the kitchen description, the stove is mentioned as ordinary and empty. So the user has the apple, so they need to go to the stove and put it there.

But the current location is the living room. The user needs to go west to the kitchen, then find the stove and put the apple there. So the next action should be to go west from the living room to the kitchen. Then, once in the kitchen, go to the stove and put the apple. But the user's next step is to go west. So the answer should be "go west".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in this text-based game. Their goal is to open the antique trunk, get the key, unlock and open the door, then go east, south, retrieve the apple, put it on the stove, and so on.

So far, they've managed to open the trunk, pick up the key, unlock the door, open it, go east to the kitchen, then south back to the living room. They picked up the apple from the couch. Now they're in the living room again, and the next step according to the original plan was to go north after picking up the apple. But when they tried going north, they ended up back in the kitchen. Then they tried going south again, which took them back to the living room. The current state is that they're in the living room again, with the apple in hand, and the score is at 7/13.

The user's next action should be to go north again, as per the original plan. But in the previous attempt, going north from the living room led them back to the kitchen. However, the kitchen has a stove, and the next step in the original plan was to put the apple on the stove. So maybe after getting the apple, they need to go to the kitchen, put the apple on the stove, and then proceed further.

But the user's current position is the living room. The next step after picking up the apple was to go north, which led them to the kitchen. Then they tried going south, which brought them back. Now, they need to go north again from the living room to reach the kitchen. However, the user might be confused because going north from the living room leads to the kitchen, but the kitchen's north exit is unguarded. So the correct next step is to go north again to the kitchen, then put the apple on the stove. But the user's last action was going south, so they need to go north again to reach the kitchen. Therefore, the next command should be "go north" to proceed to the kitchen and then put the apple on the stove.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game where they have to follow a series of steps to complete a task. The original goal was to open the antique trunk, get the key, unlock and open the wooden door, go east, south, retrieve the apple, and then put it on the stove. 

So far, the user has successfully opened the trunk, picked up the key, unlocked and opened the door, went east to the kitchen, then south to the living room, picked up the apple, and tried going north again. But now they're stuck in a loop between the kitchen and living room, going back and forth. The score is at 7, and they've been moving between the two rooms repeatedly.

The user's current position is in the kitchen again, and the next step mentioned is to go south to the living room. But the user has already done that multiple times. The challenge here is to figure out what the next correct action should be. The original goal was to put the apple on the stove. The apple is in the living room, but the user is in the kitchen now. So maybe they need to go back to the living room, put the apple on the stove, and then proceed further.

Wait, the user last went north from the living room to the kitchen, then south again. Now they're back in the kitchen. The stove is in the kitchen, right? So the next logical step would be to go to the stove, put the apple there. But how? The user has the apple in their inventory, so they need to go to the stove location and use the apple on it.

But in the current setup, the stove is in the kitchen. So the user needs to go to the stove, which is in the kitchen. But the user is already in the kitchen. Wait, the description says the stove is ordinary and has nothing on it. So maybe the user needs to go to the stove and put the apple there. But the user is in the kitchen, so they can go to the stove. However, the previous steps didn't mention the stove yet. The user has the apple, so the next step is to go to the stove and put the apple on it.

But the user's last action was going north from the living room to the kitchen. Now they're in the kitchen again. The next step should be to go to the stove, which is in the kitchen. So the command would be "go to stove" or something similar. But in the game's context, the user might need to use a specific command like "put apple on stove" or "put apple on stove". However, the game's previous commands were more about moving and interacting with objects.

Looking back, the user has the apple, so they need to go to the stove and put it there. The stove is in the kitchen, so the user is already in the kitchen. Therefore, the next action should be to put the apple on the stove. But the game might require the user to first go to the stove's location. However, the stove is already in the kitchen, so maybe the user can directly put the apple there.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go to the stove's location, which is in the kitchen, and then put the apple on it. Since the user is already in the kitchen, the next step is to go to the stove. But the game's description says the stove is ordinary and has nothing on it. So the user can put the apple there.

Therefore, the correct next action is to put the apple on the stove. The user has the apple, so the command would be "put apple on stove".
