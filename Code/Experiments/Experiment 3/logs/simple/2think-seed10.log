You are now playing a life changing round of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First off, make absolutely sure that the antique trunk is ajar. Then, retrieve the old key from the antique trunk. And then, make absolutely sure that the wooden door in the bedroom is unlocked. And then, look and see that the wooden door is open. And then, make an attempt to head east. And then, open the refrigerator inside the kitchen. If you have opened the refrigerator, pick up the lettuce from the refrigerator. And then, sit the lettuce on the stove inside the kitchen. Alright, thanks!

-= Bedroom =-
You are in a bedroom. A normal kind of place. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You can see a chest drawer. You can see a closed antique trunk, which looks usual, right there by you. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a king-size bed. The king-size bed is normal. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me try to figure out what to do next. The user is in a bedroom, and the goal is to open the wooden door in the bedroom. But the game says they have to unlock it with the old key first. So far, they tried going east, but the door is closed. Then they tried opening the door, but it's locked. The next step is to get the old key.

Wait, the user mentioned that the antique trunk is closed. The first step was to make sure the trunk is ajar. So maybe they need to open the trunk first. Then retrieve the old key from there. Once they have the key, they can unlock the wooden door. But in the current state, they haven't opened the trunk yet. So the next action should be to open the antique trunk. Let me check the previous steps again.

The user's initial instructions said: make sure the antique trunk is ajar, retrieve the old key from the trunk, then unlock the wooden door, then open the door, then go east. Then go to the kitchen, open the fridge, get lettuce, put it on the stove. But the current problem is that the wooden door is locked. So the key is probably in the trunk. So the next step is to open the trunk. Let me confirm the current state.

In the bedroom, the user sees a closed antique trunk. So the first thing to do is open that trunk. Then look inside for the old key. Once they have the key, they can unlock the door. So the next action should be to open the antique trunk. That makes sense. The user hasn't done that yet. So the answer is to open the antique trunk.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game, and they've followed the steps given. The original goal was to open the wooden door in the bedroom, which requires using the old key from the antique trunk. So far, they've opened the trunk, taken the key, and now they need to unlock the door.

The current step is to unlock the wooden door with the old key. The user has the key now, so the next logical action is to use it on the door. The previous steps were correct: opening the trunk, getting the key. Now, they need to apply the key to the door. The next command should be "unlock the wooden door" or "use old key on wooden door". But according to the game's structure, the correct command here is "unlock the wooden door" since the key is already in hand. The user has to make sure they use the key to unlock it. So the next action is to unlock the door.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game, and they've been following a set of steps to progress. The original goal mentioned was to open the refrigerator in the kitchen, get the lettuce, and put it on the stove. So far, they've managed to open the antique trunk, get the old key, unlock and open the wooden door leading east. Now they're in the next room, which is probably the kitchen since the next step was to open the refrigerator.

The user's current location is the bedroom, but after opening the wooden door east, they would move to the next room. The next step in the original instructions was to open the refrigerator. So the next action should be moving east to the kitchen, then opening the refrigerator. But the user's last action was opening the wooden door, which leads to the kitchen. Now they need to open the refrigerator. But the user hasn't moved to the kitchen yet. Wait, the previous step was opening the wooden door, which is east. So after opening the door, they need to enter the kitchen. But the game's response after opening the door might be a new scene. So the next action would be to open the refrigerator. But the user hasn't done that yet. The user's last action was opening the door, so the next step is to check the kitchen. But the user's next command should be to open the refrigerator. However, the user might need to first move into the kitchen. But in the game's context, after opening the door, the next room is the kitchen. So the next action is to open the refrigerator. The user's next command should be "open refrigerator" to proceed. But the user's previous action was opening the door, so the next step is to open the fridge. The user's next action is to open the refrigerator. Then, after that, pick up the lettuce and put it on the stove. So the correct next action is to open the refrigerator.

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. An ordinary one.

You make out a refrigerator, so there's that. What's that over there? It looks like it's a counter. The counter is normal. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What's the point of an empty counter? You can see a stove. The stove is normal. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You make out a kitchen island. On the kitchen island you see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game where they need to follow a series of steps to achieve the goal. So far, they've managed to open the antique trunk, get the old key, unlock and open the wooden door in the bedroom. Now they're in the kitchen.

The next step in the original instructions was to open the refrigerator inside the kitchen and pick up the lettuce. But when they tried to open the refrigerator, the game said they couldn't see any such thing. Wait, maybe the refrigerator is closed? Let me check the current room description.

In the Kitchen, the user sees a refrigerator, but it's closed. The note on the kitchen island might have more info. The user's previous action was going east from the bedroom to the kitchen. Now, they need to open the refrigerator. The game's response after trying to open it said they couldn't see it, but maybe they need to open it first. Wait, the user's last action was "open refrigerator", but the game said they couldn't see it. Maybe the refrigerator is closed, so they need to open it first. But the user hasn't tried that yet. So the correct action would be to open the refrigerator. Then, after opening, they can pick up the lettuce. Then, sit the lettuce on the stove. 

But the user's next action after being in the kitchen is to open the refrigerator. However, the game's response said they couldn't see it. Wait, maybe the user needs to check if the refrigerator is closed. Let me recheck the room description. The user sees a refrigerator, so it's there. But maybe it's closed. The user needs to open it. So the next step is to open the refrigerator. Then, after opening, take the lettuce. Then, sit it on the stove. So the next action should be "open refrigerator".

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps to open the antique trunk, get the key, unlock and open the wooden door, then go east to the kitchen. They opened the fridge, took the lettuce. Now they need to put the lettuce on the stove.

The current location is the kitchen. The next step according to the original plan was to sit the lettuce on the stove inside the kitchen. So the correct action here would be to go to the stove and place the lettuce there. But first, maybe they need to check if the stove is accessible. The description mentions the stove is normal but empty. Since the user is holding the lettuce, the next command should be to go to the stove. Wait, but the user is already in the kitchen. The stove is in the kitchen, so they can just go to it. The command would be "go to stove" or "go to stove inside kitchen". But the game might require exact commands. Looking back at previous actions, the user used "open refrigerator" and "take lettuce from refrigerator". So maybe the next step is "put lettuce on stove". But the game might require being at the stove first. So perhaps "go to stove" first, then "put lettuce on stove". But the user's last action was taking the lettuce. So the next step is to go to the stove and put it there. The correct command would be "go to stove" or "go to stove inside kitchen". But the game's previous commands were more direct. Let me check the previous steps. The user was in the kitchen, and the stove is mentioned as being there. So the next action is to go to the stove and put the lettuce on it. The correct command is "go to stove" or "go to stove inside kitchen". But the game might have specific commands. Since the user is in the kitchen, and the stove is in the kitchen, the command is "go to stove". But maybe the correct command is "put lettuce on stove". However, the user needs to be at the stove first. So the next step is to go to the stove. Therefore, the answer is "go to stove".
