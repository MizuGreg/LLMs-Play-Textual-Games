Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First step, assure that the chest drawer within the bedroom is opened. And then, retrieve the old key from the chest drawer. After that, make absolutely sure that the wooden door in the bedroom is unlocked with the old key. After that, open the wooden door inside the bedroom. After that, attempt to travel east. Following that, ensure that the refrigerator in the kitchen is open. And then, take the lettuce from the refrigerator inside the kitchen. And then, rest the lettuce on the stove. Alright, thanks!

-= Bedroom =-
You've stumbled into a typical room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be typical. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the bedroom.

As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a chest drawer. You make out a closed antique trunk. You can see a king-size bed. But the thing is empty.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps to open the chest drawer, take the old key, and now they've done that. The next step according to the original instructions was to unlock the wooden door in the bedroom with the old key. So the next action should be to unlock the door.

Wait, the user just took the key, so now they need to use it on the door. The door is closed, so they need to unlock it. The command would be "unlock wooden door with old key" or something similar. But in the game's context, maybe it's just "unlock wooden door" since the key is already in hand. Let me check the previous steps. The user was told to "make absolutely sure that the wooden door in the bedroom is unlocked with the old key." So the action is to unlock the door using the key. 

So the next command should be "unlock wooden door". Then, after that, open the door. So the next step is to unlock the door. The user has already taken the key, so they can proceed to unlock the door. The response should be "unlock wooden door".

So the next command is "go east."

GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Kitchen =-
You've entered a kitchen. The room is well lit.

You make out a closed refrigerator right there by you. You make out a counter. But there isn't a thing on it. You make out a stove. The stove is standard. But there isn't a thing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an unguarded exit to the north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

-= Living Room =-
This might come as a shock to you, but you've just stumbled into a living room.

You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a couch. On the couch you can see a tomato plant. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a low table. The low table is ordinary. On the low table you see a remote. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a tv. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north.

Okay, let's recap the user's actions so far. They started in the bedroom, opened the chest drawer, took the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door to go east into the kitchen. Then they went south into the living room. The original goal was to retrieve the lettuce from the kitchen fridge, rest it on the stove, etc. But in the current scene, they're in the living room, and the kitchen is to the north. Wait, the user was in the kitchen earlier, then went south to the living room. Now, the kitchen is north from the living room. So to get back to the kitchen, they need to go north. But the user's next step should be to return to the kitchen to proceed with the lettuce task. However, the user's current location is the living room, and the kitchen is north. So the correct next action is to go north back to the kitchen. But the user's previous action was go south, leading them to the living room. So the next step is to go north to reach the kitchen again. But the user's score is 5/7, so they need to continue with the tasks. The next step after going north would be to open the refrigerator in the kitchen, take the lettuce, then put it on the stove. But since they're in the living room now, the next move is to go north back to the kitchen. So the answer should be "go north".

Okay, the user has opened the refrigerator and found a lettuce and a half-bag of chips. The next step according to the original instructions was to "take the lettuce from the refrigerator inside the kitchen." So the correct action here is to take the lettuce. The user has already opened the fridge, so they need to pick up the lettuce. The command would be "take lettuce." Then, after taking the lettuce, they need to rest it on the stove. But the next step immediately after taking the lettuce would be to put it on the stove. However, the user's next action should be to take the lettuce first. So the answer is "take lettuce."

Okay, the user tried to "rest lettuce on stove" but the game didn't recognize it. So I need to find the correct command for putting the lettuce on the stove. In text adventures, common verbs are "put" or "place". So maybe the correct command is "put lettuce on stove". Let me check the previous actions. The user took the lettuce, so now they need to place it on the stove. The correct verb here is "put". So the next action should be "put lettuce on stove".
