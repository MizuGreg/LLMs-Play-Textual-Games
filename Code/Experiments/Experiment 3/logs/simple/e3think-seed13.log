I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is how to play! First, it would be great if you could ensure that the chest drawer within the bedroom is open. And then, retrieve the old key from the chest drawer. And then, unlock the wooden door with the old key. And then, ensure that the wooden door within the bedroom is open. And then, make an attempt to go east. And then, open the screen door. After opening the screen door, make an effort to go to the east. Then, take a trip south. And then, retrieve the bell pepper from the floor of the garden. If you can get your hands on the bell pepper, head north. Then, travel west. After that, rest the bell pepper on the stove. Got that? Good!

-= Bedroom =-
You're now in the bedroom. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You can make out a chest drawer. You can see a closed antique trunk. You make out a king-size bed. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Hm. Oh well

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me see. The user is in a text-based game called TextWorld. Their goal is to follow a series of steps to retrieve the bell pepper and maybe other items. So far, they've opened the chest drawer, retrieved the old key, and unlocked the wooden door. The next step mentioned was to ensure the wooden door is open, then try to go east, open the screen door, go east again, travel south, get the bell pepper, put it on the stove, etc.

Wait, the user just retrieved the old key. The next step in the original instructions was to "unlock the wooden door with the old key." But in the current state, the wooden door is closed. So after taking the key, they need to use it to unlock the door. But the user hasn't done that yet. The previous action was taking the key, so the next logical step is to unlock the door. However, the user's last action was taking the key, and the system message says to only output the command. So the next action should be "unlock wooden door with old key". But maybe the game requires using the key on the door. Alternatively, maybe the door is already unlocked? Wait, the initial description said the wooden door is closed. So the user needs to unlock it. So the next step is to unlock the door with the key. Then, after that, go east. But the user's next action should be "unlock wooden door with old key". Let me check the previous steps again.

The user's previous action was taking the old key. The next step in the original plan was to "unlock the wooden door with the old key." So the correct command here is "unlock wooden door with old key". But the user might have to use the key on the door. So the assistant should output that command.

So after opening the wooden door, the next step is to go east. But the user just did that, and the system message says they have to open the wooden door first. Wait, maybe the door was locked, so they had to unlock and then open it. Now that it's open, they can go through.

So the next action should be to go east. But the user just did that, and the system message says they have to open the door first. Wait, maybe the user tried to go east without opening the door, which was closed. So the correct step is to open the door first. But the user already opened it. So now, after opening the door, they can go east. So the next command is "go east".

-= Kitchen =-
You've just sauntered into a kitchen.

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a refrigerator. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a counter. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. You make out a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. The stove is ordinary. The stove appears to be empty. You can see a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

If you're wondering why everything seems so ordinary all of a sudden, it's because you've just walked into the backyard. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You can see a set of chairs. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a set of chairs, go to TextWorld. The set of chairs is usual. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You see a bbq. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You swear loudly. You can see a patio table. Now why would someone leave that there? But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.

There is an open screen door leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the backyard. The original goal was to retrieve the bell pepper from the garden. So far, they've gone through the kitchen, opened the screen door, and moved to the backyard. The next step in the plan was to travel south after opening the screen door and going east. Wait, the user just opened the screen door and went east, which led them to the backyard. Now, the next step according to the original instructions was to "travel south" after opening the screen door and going east. But in the current location (backyard), there's an exit to the south. So the next action should be to go south. Let me check the previous steps again.

The user's last action was "go east" from the kitchen, which led them to the backyard. Now, in the backyard, the exit to the south is unblocked. So the next step is to go south. That should take them to the garden where the bell pepper is. So the correct command is "go south".

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Garden, and the items mentioned are a half of a bag of chips, an apple, a bell pepper, and a shovel on the floor. The user tried to "take bell pepper from floor" but got a "You can't see any such thing" response. Wait, but the description says the bell pepper is on the floor. Maybe the command should be "take bell pepper" without specifying the floor, since the item is already mentioned as being on the floor. Alternatively, maybe the game requires a different phrasing. Let me check the previous steps.

The user's last action was "take bell pepper from floor", which didn't work. The system says "You can't see any such thing." But according to the environment description, the bell pepper is indeed on the floor. Maybe the correct command is just "take bell pepper" without the "from floor" part. Or perhaps the game expects "take bell pepper from floor" but the item isn't there. Wait, the description says "a bell pepper and a shovel on the floor," so the bell pepper is on the floor. So the correct command should be "take bell pepper from floor". But the user tried that twice and got the same error. Maybe there's a typo in the item's name? Like "bell pepper" vs. "bell pepper" (same). Alternatively, maybe the game requires using the correct preposition. Maybe "take bell pepper from the floor" with "the". But the user's previous commands didn't use "the". Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the item is not visible, but the description says it's there. This is confusing. The user needs to take the bell pepper, so the correct command is likely "take bell pepper from floor" again. But since the system says it's not there, maybe the user needs to look again. But the user can't look, only take actions. Alternatively, maybe the command should be "take bell pepper" without specifying the location. Let me try that. The user might have to just say "take bell pepper" and the game will recognize it's on the floor. So the next action is "take bell pepper".

Okay, the user is in the Garden and has the bell pepper. The next step was to go north. They tried "head north" which wasn't recognized, so they used "go north" instead. The game responded positively. Now, they need to continue towards the original goal, which was to rest the bell pepper on the stove. But first, they need to get back to the kitchen or stove. Since they came from the backyard, maybe the next step is to go back west to the kitchen, then north to the stove. But the current location is the Garden. The exit to the north is unblocked. So the next action is to go north again. Wait, the user just went north and the response was positive. So the next step after going north would be to move towards the stove. But the user's next action should be "go north" again. Alternatively, maybe after going north, they reach the kitchen again. But the original plan was to go south from the kitchen to the garden, get the bell pepper, then go north. So after getting the bell pepper, they need to go north to the kitchen, then find the stove.
