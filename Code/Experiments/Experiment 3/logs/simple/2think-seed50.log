Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to open the chest drawer in the bedroom. After that, pick up the old key from the chest drawer within the bedroom. And then, look and see that the wooden door in the bedroom is unlocked. Then, open the wooden door inside the bedroom. After that, make an effort to move east. And then, go to the south. And then, recover the half of a bag of chips from the couch. Once you have got the half of a bag of chips, go north. With that over with, put the half of a bag of chips on the stove. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Bedroom =-
Well, here we are in the bedroom. Let's see what's in here.

You can see a closed chest drawer. You make out an antique trunk. You see a king-size bed. You shudder, but continue examining the king-size bed. The king-size bed is ordinary. The king-size bed appears to be empty.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me see. The user has already opened the chest drawer and picked up the old key. The next step according to the instructions was to check if the wooden door in the bedroom is unlocked. But wait, the user mentioned that after picking up the key, they need to look and see that the door is unlocked. But in the current scene, the door is closed. Hmm, maybe the key is needed to unlock it.

Wait, the user's previous action was picking up the key. Now, the next step is to check if the door is unlocked. But the door is closed. Maybe the key is required to open it. So the next action should be to try opening the door with the key. But the game might have specific commands. Let me check the previous steps again.

The original instructions said: after picking up the key, look and see that the wooden door is unlocked. But in the current state, the door is closed. So maybe the key is needed to unlock it. So the next step is to try opening the door. But the user has to use the key. So the correct action here is to try opening the door. But the game might have a command like "use key on door" or "open door". However, the user's previous actions were "open chest drawer" and "pick up old key". Now, the next step is to open the wooden door. But the door is closed. So the user needs to open it. But how? Maybe using the key. So the next action should be "open wooden door" or "use key on door". But the game might require the key to unlock it. So the correct command here is "open wooden door". Let me check the previous messages. The user was told to "look and see that the wooden door in the bedroom is unlocked". But the door is closed. So maybe the key is needed to unlock it. Therefore, the next action is to open the door with the key. But the game might require the user to use the key on the door. However, the user's previous actions were "open chest drawer" and "pick up old key". Now, the next step is to open the door. So the correct command is "open wooden door". But since the door is closed, maybe the key is needed. So the user should try to open the door. The game might accept "open wooden door" as the command. So the next action is "open wooden door".

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps given. They started by opening the chest drawer, picking up the key, unlocking the door, and now they're in the bedroom. The next step according to the original instructions was to move east. But the user hasn't done that yet.

Wait, the previous action was unlocking the wooden door. Now, the next step in the original plan was to move east. So the next command should be "go east". But I need to check if there's any other step in between. The user has to move east after opening the door. Then, after moving east, they need to go south. But the user hasn't moved yet. So the next action should be "go east" to proceed to the next room. Let me make sure that's correct. The user is in the bedroom, unlocked the door, so moving east would take them to the next area. Then, after that, they need to go south. But the current step is after unlocking the door, so the next command is definitely "go east".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in the TextWorld game. So far, they've opened the chest drawer, picked up the old key, tried to unlock the wooden door, and even went east but got blocked because the door wasn't unlocked. They tried unlocking it again, but it was already unlocked. Now, they need to move east.

Wait, the current state is that the wooden door is unlocked. The user tried to go east but was told they need to open the door first. But the door is already unlocked. Maybe the issue is that the door is unlocked but not open? Or maybe the game requires the door to be opened after unlocking. Let me check the previous steps.

In the history, after unlocking the door, the user tried to go east, but the game said they had to open the door first. So maybe the door is unlocked but still closed. So the next step should be to open the door. But the user already tried unlocking it, and the message said "That's unlocked at the moment." So perhaps the door is unlocked but not open. So the correct action would be to open the door. But the user's last action was trying to go east again, which failed. So the next step should be to open the door. But the user is supposed to move east after opening the door. So the correct sequence is: unlock the door (already done), open the door, then go east. But the user is confused because the game says they need to open the door first. So maybe the door is unlocked but still closed, so they need to open it. Therefore, the next action should be to open the door. But the user's last action was trying to go east again, which is why the game is prompting again. So the correct next step is to open the door. But the user might not know that the door is closed even though it's unlocked. So the answer should be to open the door. But the user's previous action was trying to go east, which is why the game is saying they need to open the door. Therefore, the next action is to open the door. But the user is supposed to go east after opening the door. So the correct next step is to open the door. But the user might not realize that the door is closed. So the answer is to open the door.

You've just sauntered into a kitchen. You begin looking for stuff.

Oh, great. Here's a refrigerator. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a counter. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a counter? The counter is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You can make out a stove. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a stove, go to TextWorld. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove. Were you looking for a kitchen island? Because look over there, it's a kitchen island. The kitchen island is typical. On the kitchen island you see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

Okay, let me figure out what to do next. The user's goal is to recover the half bag of chips from the couch, then put it on the stove. So far, they've opened the chest drawer, picked up the key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, and went east into the kitchen. Now in the kitchen, they need to find the couch. Wait, the current location is the kitchen, but the couch was mentioned in the bedroom. Wait, the original instructions said to "recover the half of a bag of chips from the couch" after moving east and then going south. Wait, maybe the couch is in the kitchen? Or maybe the user made a mistake in the path.

Wait, the user was in the bedroom, then went east into the kitchen. The kitchen has a note on the kitchen island. The original goal was to go south from the bedroom, but after opening the door, they went east. Wait, the initial instructions said after opening the wooden door in the bedroom, move east, then go south. But in the current state, the user is in the kitchen. So maybe the next step is to go south from the kitchen? Let me check the current location.

In the kitchen, there's an unguarded exit to the south. So maybe going south from the kitchen would take them back to the bedroom? But the original plan was to go south from the bedroom after opening the door. But the user already went east. Maybe there's confusion in the path. Alternatively, maybe the couch is in the kitchen. The user needs to find the half bag of chips from the couch. But in the kitchen description, there's no mention of a couch. The kitchen has a counter, stove, kitchen island, and a note. The couch was mentioned in the bedroom. Wait, the original instruction said to "recover the half of a bag of chips from the couch" after moving east and then going south. Wait, perhaps the couch is in the kitchen? Or maybe the user needs to go back to the bedroom, then south?

Wait, the user is in the kitchen now. The original plan was to move east (which they did), then go south. But after moving east, the next step was to go south. But in the current location, the user is in the kitchen. So maybe the next step is to go south from the kitchen. Let me check the kitchen's exits. The kitchen has an exit to the south. So going south would take them back to the bedroom. Then, from the bedroom, they need to go south again? Wait, the initial steps were: after opening the wooden door in the bedroom, move east (to kitchen), then go south. But maybe the user is supposed to go south from the kitchen to return to the bedroom, then proceed further. But the original goal was to recover the chips from the couch. If the couch is in the bedroom, then maybe the user needs to go back to the bedroom, check the couch. But the user is in the kitchen now. So the next step would be to go south from the kitchen to return to the bedroom, then check the couch. But the user hasn't found the chips yet. Alternatively, maybe the couch is in the kitchen. But the kitchen description doesn't mention a couch. The user might have made a mistake in the path. Alternatively, maybe the couch is in the kitchen island. But the note is on the kitchen island. Maybe the half bag of chips is on the kitchen island. But the user needs to check. However, the original instruction said to recover it from the couch. So perhaps the user needs to go back to the bedroom, find the couch, and take the chips. But the user is in the kitchen now. So the next step is to go south to the bedroom, then check the couch. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the correct next action would be to go south from the kitchen. But the user is in the kitchen, so the command would be "go south".

You find yourself in a living room. An ordinary one. You begin looking for stuff.

You see a couch. You see a half of a bag of chips on the couch, so there's that. You can see a low table. You see a remote on the low table. You scan the room for a tv, and you find a tv. But the thing is empty. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Okay, the user has been following the steps correctly so far. They opened the chest drawer, picked up the key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, then went east to the kitchen. From there, they went south to the living room and picked up the half bag of chips. The next step according to the original instructions was to go north from the living room. But the user hasn't done that yet. The current location is the living room, so the next action should be to go north. Then, after going north, they need to put the chips on the stove. But since the user is at the living room, the immediate next step is to go north. The assistant should respond with "go north".
