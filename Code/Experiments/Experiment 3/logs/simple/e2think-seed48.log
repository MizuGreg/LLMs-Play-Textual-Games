-= Bedroom =-
You've entered a bedroom.

You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a chest drawer! You make out a closed antique trunk in the room. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a king-size bed. The king-size bed is normal. But there isn't a thing on it.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps to open the chest drawer, take the old key, and then needs to unlock the wooden door. So far, they've completed the first two steps. The next step according to the instructions is to check that the wooden door is unlocked with the old key. So the next action should be to use the key on the door.

Wait, the user has the old key now. The wooden door is closed. So the correct action is to unlock it. The command would be "unlock wooden door" or "use old key on wooden door". But in the game's context, maybe the exact phrasing matters. Let me check the previous commands. The user was told to "check that the wooden door inside the bedroom is unlocked with the old key." So the action would be to unlock the door using the key. The correct command here is likely "unlock wooden door" or "use old key on wooden door". But in the game's terminology, maybe it's "unlock" or "open". But since the key is needed, the correct action is to unlock the door. So the next step is to unlock the wooden door with the old key. The user has taken the key, so now they need to use it on the door. The next command should be "unlock wooden door".

Okay, the user has successfully unlocked and opened the wooden door. The next step in the original instructions was to "look and see that the wooden door inside the bedroom is ajar." But since they just opened it, maybe they need to check if it's ajar. However, the next step after that was to "try to head east." So after opening the door, the next action should be to move east. The user is in the bedroom, and the door leads east. So the command would be "go east".

Wait, but the current location is the bedroom, and the wooden door is now open. The next step is to head east through the door. So the correct command is "go east". The user has to move to the next room. Then, after that, they need to open the refrigerator, recover the tomato plant, rest it on the stove, and win. So the next action is definitely "go east".

-= Kitchen =-
You're now in the kitchen.

You make out a refrigerator. You make out a counter. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a stove. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You make out a kitchen island. The kitchen island is standard. On the kitchen island you make out a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

Okay, the user has opened the refrigerator and found a bell pepper and a tomato plant. The next step according to the original instructions was to "recover the tomato plant from the refrigerator." So the user needs to take the tomato plant. The command would be "take tomato plant". Let me check the previous actions. The user took the old key from the chest drawer, unlocked the door, opened it, and now is in the kitchen. The refrigerator is open, so taking the tomato plant is the next logical step. Then, after taking it, they need to rest it on the stove. But the next action should be to take the tomato plant.

Okay, the user tried to "rest tomato plant on stove" but the game didn't recognize it. So I need to figure out the correct command. Maybe "put tomato plant on stove" is the right verb. Let me check the previous commands. The user took the tomato plant from the refrigerator. Now, they need to place it on the stove. The correct action would be "put tomato plant on stove". The game might expect "put" instead of "rest". So the next command should be "put tomato plant on stove".
