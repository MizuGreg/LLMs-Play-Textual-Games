Welcome to TextWorld! Here is how to play! First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to ensure that the antique trunk is open. After that, recover the old key from the antique trunk within the bedroom. After that, unlock the wooden door. After that, open the wooden door. And then, venture east. Okay, and then, ensure that the refrigerator is open. And then, retrieve the tomato plant from the refrigerator in the kitchen. If you have taken the tomato plant, place the tomato plant on the stove within the kitchen. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Bedroom =-
Look around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a bedroom.

You can make out a closed chest drawer right there by you. You can see a closed antique trunk nearby. Look over there! a king-size bed. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a king-size bed, go to TextWorld. The king-size bed is normal. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a TextWorld game. Their goal is to open the antique trunk, get the key, unlock the wooden door, open it, go east, then handle the refrigerator and tomato plant.

So far, they've opened the antique trunk and taken the old key. The current score is 2 out of 3. The next step according to the initial instructions was to unlock the wooden door. But wait, the wooden door is closed, right? The user has the key now. So they need to use the key to unlock the door. But the game might require them to first open the door, then go east. Wait, the original instructions said after unlocking the door, open it, then go east. So maybe the steps are: unlock the door, then open it, then go east. But in the game, the door might be locked, so using the key to unlock it. Then, once unlocked, open it. Then go east. Then proceed to the kitchen, open the fridge, get the tomato plant, put it on the stove. Then win.

So the next action should be to unlock the wooden door with the key. The user has the key, so they need to use it on the door. The command would be "unlock wooden door" or "use old key on wooden door". But in TextWorld, the correct command might be "unlock wooden door" since the key is already taken. Let me check the previous steps. The user took the key from the trunk, so now they need to unlock the door. The door is described as closed and leading east. So the next step is to unlock it. Therefore, the correct command is "unlock wooden door".

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps given in the initial instructions. They started by opening the antique trunk, taking the old key, unlocking the wooden door, and opening it. Now they're in the next area, which is probably the kitchen since the next step mentioned was to open the refrigerator and get the tomato plant.

The user's current location is the bedroom after opening the wooden door. The next step according to the original plan was to venture east, which they did by opening the wooden door. Now, the next task is to ensure the refrigerator is open and retrieve the tomato plant from there. But the user hasn't mentioned moving to the kitchen yet. So the next logical step would be to go into the kitchen. However, the user might need to check if the refrigerator is in the kitchen. Since the instructions say to open the refrigerator in the kitchen, the next action should be moving to the kitchen. But how? Maybe there's a door or a path leading to the kitchen. Since the previous action was opening the wooden door, which was east, perhaps the kitchen is the next room. So the next command should be to go into the kitchen, then open the refrigerator, take the tomato plant, put it on the stove, and then win. But the user's next action should be to go to the kitchen. However, the user's current location is the bedroom after opening the door. So the next step is to go east again or check the kitchen. But the user needs to move to the kitchen. So the next command is "go east" again to reach the kitchen. Wait, but the wooden door was already opened, so maybe the next room is the kitchen. Therefore, the next action is to go into the kitchen. But the user's previous action was opening the wooden door, so the next step is to move into the kitchen. So the next command should be "go east" again. But the user might need to check the kitchen's location. Alternatively, maybe the kitchen is adjacent. So the next action is to go into the kitchen. But the user's current location is the bedroom after opening the door. So the next step is to go east to the kitchen. Therefore, the next command is "go east".

-= Kitchen =-
You've entered a kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

Oh, great. Here's a refrigerator. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. The counter is normal. But there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You see a stove. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The stove is standard. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You make out a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Okay, let me figure out the next step here. The user has to retrieve the tomato plant from the refrigerator in the kitchen. They just opened the refrigerator and found a tomato plant and milk. The goal was to take the tomato plant, put it on the stove, and then win. So the next logical step is to take the tomato plant. But wait, the user needs to make sure they take the tomato plant. The command would be "take tomato plant from refrigerator". But in the game's context, maybe it's just "take tomato plant". Let me check the previous actions. Earlier, they took the old key from the trunk. So maybe the correct command here is "take tomato plant". The refrigerator is open, so they can take it. Then after taking it, they need to go to the stove. But the current location is the kitchen, so after taking the tomato plant, the next step would be to go to the stove. But the user's next action should be taking the tomato plant first. So the answer is "take tomato plant".

Okay, the user tried to "place tomato plant on stove" but the system said that's not a recognized verb. Let me think about the possible correct commands here.

In TextWorld games, commands are usually verbs that match the game's allowed actions. The user has the tomato plant and is in the kitchen. The stove is in the room. The correct action would likely be "put" instead of "place". So maybe the correct command is "put tomato plant on stove".

Alternatively, maybe "place" is a valid verb here, but the system rejected it. Since the user's previous action was "take tomato plant from refrigerator", which worked, perhaps "put" is the right verb. Let me check the possible commands again.

The user is supposed to place the tomato plant on the stove. The correct command should be "put tomato plant on stove". The system might not recognize "place" as a valid verb, so using "put" is better. Therefore, the next action should be "put tomato plant on stove".
