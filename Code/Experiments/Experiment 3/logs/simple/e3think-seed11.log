Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First step, assure that the chest drawer within the bedroom is opened. And then, retrieve the old key from the chest drawer. After that, make absolutely sure that the wooden door in the bedroom is unlocked with the old key. After that, open the wooden door inside the bedroom. After that, attempt to travel east. Following that, ensure that the refrigerator in the kitchen is open. And then, take the lettuce from the refrigerator inside the kitchen. And then, rest the lettuce on the stove. Alright, thanks!

-= Bedroom =-
You've stumbled into a typical room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be typical. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the bedroom.

As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a chest drawer. You make out a closed antique trunk. You can see a king-size bed. But the thing is empty.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, let me see. The user has been following the steps to open the chest drawer, take the key, unlock the door, and now they've opened the door. The next step according to the original instructions was to open the wooden door inside the bedroom. Wait, the user just unlocked the door, so maybe the next step is to open it. But the user's last action was unlocking the door, and the score increased. Now, the next step in the original plan was to open the wooden door inside the bedroom. Wait, maybe the door is already open? Or maybe the user needs to open it after unlocking.

Wait, the user's last action was "unlock wooden door with old key", which was successful. The next step in the original instructions was "open the wooden door inside the bedroom." So the user needs to now open the door. So the next command should be "open wooden door". Then, after that, they need to attempt to travel east. So after opening the door, they can go east. Then, the next steps are to go to the kitchen, open the refrigerator, take lettuce, rest it on the stove.

So the next action here is to open the wooden door. The user has already unlocked it, but maybe it's still locked? Or maybe unlocking is different from opening. So the correct next step is to open the door. So the command should be "open wooden door".

GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Kitchen =-
You've entered a kitchen. The room is well lit.

You make out a closed refrigerator right there by you. You make out a counter. But there isn't a thing on it. You make out a stove. The stove is standard. But there isn't a thing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an unguarded exit to the north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps correctly. They opened the chest drawer, took the key, unlocked the door, opened the door, and went east to the kitchen. Now they've opened the refrigerator and found lettuce and chips. The next step was to take the lettuce. So the correct command here is "take lettuce". Then, after taking it, they need to rest it on the stove. But according to the original instructions, after taking the lettuce, the next step is to rest it on the stove. So after taking the lettuce, the user should "rest lettuce on stove". But the user's last action was opening the refrigerator, so the next step is to take the lettuce. Therefore, the next command is "take lettuce".

Okay, the user is trying to rest the lettuce on the stove, but the game says "That's not a verb I recognise." So the command "rest lettuce on stove" is invalid. Maybe the correct verb is "put" instead of "rest"? Let me check the possible commands. In TextWorld, common verbs are "take", "put", "open", "close", "use", etc. "Rest" might not be a valid verb here. So the user should use "put lettuce on stove" instead. Let me try that.

Wait, the user's previous action was taking the lettuce. Now they need to place it on the stove. The correct command would be "put lettuce on stove". Let me confirm if "put" is the right verb. Yes, "put" is a standard verb for placing items. So the next action should be "put lettuce on stove".
