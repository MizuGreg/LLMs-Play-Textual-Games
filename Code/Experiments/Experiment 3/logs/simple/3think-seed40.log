Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an exciting round of TextWorld? You do! Here is how to play! First stop, ensure that the chest drawer within the bedroom is open. And then, pick up the old key from the chest drawer. After that, make absolutely sure that the wooden door is unlocked. Then, ensure that the wooden door is open. After that, venture east.

-= Bedroom =-
Well, here we are in the bedroom.

You can make out a chest drawer. You can see a closed antique trunk. You make out a king-size bed. However, the king-size bed, like an empty king-size bed, has nothing on it.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me see. The user is playing this TextWorld game, and they've followed the steps given. So far, they've opened the chest drawer, picked up the old key, unlocked the wooden door. The next step according to the initial instructions was to ensure the wooden door is open. Wait, they just unlocked it, but maybe they need to open it? Or does unlocking mean it's open? Hmm.

In the game, the wooden door was closed before. The user used the old key to unlock it. But the next step in the original plan was to "ensure that the wooden door is open." So maybe after unlocking, they need to open it. But sometimes in text adventures, unlocking and opening might be separate actions. Let me check the previous steps again.

The initial instructions said: "make absolutely sure that the wooden door is unlocked. Then, ensure that the wooden door is open." So first, unlock it, then open it. The user just unlocked it, so the next action should be to open the door. But the user's last action was "unlock wooden door," which was successful. Now, the next step is to open the door. So the correct command here would be "open wooden door." That makes sense. The user needs to open it after unlocking. So the next action is to open the door. Then, after that, venture east, then move south, etc. So the next command should be "open wooden door."

-= Kitchen =-
I am sorry to announce that you are now in the kitchen.

You see a closed refrigerator right there by you. You scan the room, seeing a counter. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You see a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. You can make out a kitchen island. The kitchen island is standard. On the kitchen island you make out a note. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Living Room =-
You are in a living room. A normal kind of place.

Oh, great. Here's a couch. The couch is typical. On the couch you can see a bell pepper. You see a low table. You see a remote on the low table. You can make out a tv! The tv is usual. However, the tv, like an empty tv, has nothing on it. You move on, clearly upset with your TextWorld experience.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps to complete the game. They started in the bedroom, opened the chest drawer, picked up the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, then went east to the kitchen. From the kitchen, they went south to the living room. Now, in the living room, they need to take the bell pepper from the couch.

The original goal mentioned in the instructions was to take the bell pepper from the couch in the living room. The user has already reached the living room, so the next logical step is to pick up the bell pepper. The score is at 6/7, so they need to do this quickly. The next action should be to take the bell pepper. Then, according to the initial instructions, they need to go north, rest the bell pepper on the stove in the kitchen. But since they're in the living room now, the immediate next step is to take the bell pepper. The user's last action was going south to the living room, so the next command should be 'take bell pepper'.

Okay, the user tried to "rest bell pepper on stove" but the game didn't recognize it. Let me think about the possible correct command. In TextWorld, actions are usually verbs that match the objects available.

The user has the bell pepper, and they need to place it on the stove. The correct command might be "put bell pepper on stove". The previous action was taking the bell pepper, so now they need to put it somewhere. The stove is in the kitchen, so "put bell pepper on stove" is likely the right command. Let me check the available actions in the kitchen description. The stove is mentioned, but it's closed. Wait, the stove is described as "but there isn't a thing on it". So maybe the action is to put the bell pepper on the stove. The user tried "rest", which isn't a valid verb here. The correct verb is "put". So the next action should be "put bell pepper on stove".
