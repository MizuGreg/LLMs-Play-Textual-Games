Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, you could, like, ensure that the chest drawer is open. And then, take the old key from the chest drawer inside the bedroom. With the old key, doublecheck that the wooden door is unlocked. And then, open the wooden door within the bedroom. Then, attempt to go east. Then, make absolutely sure that the screen door inside the kitchen is opened. And then, attempt to venture east. Next, travel south. And then, lift the half of a bag of chips from the floor of the garden. Then, make an effort to move north. If you can finish that, venture west. And then, rest the half of a bag of chips on the stove. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Bedroom =-
You've just sauntered into a bedroom. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

You can see a chest drawer. You can see an antique trunk. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You see a king-size bed. The king-size bed is usual. The king-size bed appears to be empty.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a text adventure game. They've already opened the chest drawer and taken the old key. The next step according to the original task was to double-check that the wooden door is unlocked using the old key. So, I need to make sure they unlock the door.

Wait, the current location is the bedroom. The wooden door leading east is closed. The user has the old key, so they should use it to unlock the door. The next action should be to unlock the wooden door. But how is the command structured here? In TextWorld, the command would be something like "unlock wooden door" or "use old key on wooden door". But the user has the key, so maybe "unlock wooden door" is the right command here. Let me check the previous actions. The user was told to "doublecheck that the wooden door is unlocked" using the key. So the correct action is to unlock it. The next step after taking the key is to unlock the door. So the next command should be "unlock wooden door".

Okay, let me figure out what to do next. The user tried to go east but couldn't because the wooden door was still closed. They already unlocked the door with the old key, so maybe the door is unlocked now. Wait, the previous message said "You unlock wooden door" and the score increased. So the door should be open now. But the system message says "You have to open the wooden door first." That's confusing. Maybe there's a mistake here. The user has the key and unlocked the door, so perhaps they need to open it again? Or maybe the door is locked again? Hmm. The user's next action should be to go east again after ensuring the door is open. Since the score was updated, maybe the door is open now. So the correct next step is to go east.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in the TextWorld game. So far, they've opened the chest drawer, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door, but tried to go east before opening it. The game is reminding them that the door needs to be opened first.

The user's current score is 3 out of 7, which suggests they have a few more steps to go. The original goal involves moving through different areas: bedroom, kitchen, garden, and then putting the chips on the stove. The user has already dealt with the bedroom part, but they're stuck trying to go east without the door open.

The next logical step after unlocking the door would be to open it. The game might require them to open the door before proceeding east. Since the user tried going east but was blocked, the correct action now is to open the wooden door again. Wait, but they already unlocked it. Maybe the door is locked, so they need to open it with the key. But they already used the key to unlock it. Hmm, maybe the door is closed, so they need to open it. But the previous action was unlocking, so perhaps the door is now unlocked but closed. So the next step is to open the door. But the game might have a specific command for that. Alternatively, maybe the door is locked, and they need to use the key again. But the user already did that. Wait, the initial instruction said to "doublecheck that the wooden door is unlocked" and then "open the wooden door". So maybe after unlocking, they need to open it. But the game might consider unlocking and opening as separate actions. So the user needs to open the door after unlocking. So the next action should be to open the wooden door. But the user tried going east and was told to open the door first. So perhaps the door is closed, and they need to open it. So the correct command is "open wooden door".

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Kitchen now. The task was to make sure the screen door inside the kitchen is opened and then attempt to venture east. The user just arrived here after opening the wooden door from the bedroom. The kitchen has a closed screen door leading east and an open wooden door west. The user's next step should be to open the screen door.

Looking at the previous actions, the user had to open the wooden door in the bedroom before going east. Now, in the kitchen, the screen door is closed. The user needs to open it to proceed east. The score has already increased, so the user is on the right track. The next action should be to open the screen door.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps in the game as outlined in the initial instructions. They started in the bedroom, opened the chest drawer, took the old key, unlocked the wooden door, and then opened it to go east into the kitchen. Then they opened the screen door in the kitchen and went east again to the backyard.

Now, the current location is the backyard. The next step in the original task was to travel south from the backyard. The user's last action was going east from the kitchen to the backyard. The current prompt mentions that there's an unblocked exit to the south in the backyard. So the next logical step would be to go south. The user needs to follow the sequence of actions mentioned in the initial task, which includes traveling south from the backyard. The user's previous actions have been correctly following the steps, so the next command should be "go south".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the steps given in the original task. So far, they've opened the chest drawer, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door, opened it, went east to the kitchen, opened the screen door, went east to the backyard, then south to the garden. Now, in the garden, they need to pick up the half of a bag of chips from the floor. But when they tried to take it, the game said they can't see any such thing. Hmm, maybe the item isn't directly on the floor? Let me check the description again.

The garden description says: "There is an apple, a lettuce, a half of a bag of chips and a shovel on the floor." Wait, so the half of a bag of chips is indeed on the floor. But the user tried to take it and got a message that it's not there. That's confusing. Maybe the item has a different name or description? Or maybe the user needs to use a different command. The correct command should be "take half of a bag of chips from floor" as per the task. But the game's response says "You can't see any such thing." Maybe the game is expecting a different phrasing. Let me think. Maybe the item is called "a half of a bag of chips" but the game's parser is case-sensitive or uses a different term. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to first look around to find it. But the task says to take it from the floor. Wait, the user already tried that. Maybe the game is malfunctioning, but according to the instructions, the user should proceed as per the task. The next step after taking the chips is to rest it on the stove. But first, they need to pick it up. Since the game's response says they can't see it, maybe the user needs to check again. But the task says to take it from the floor. Maybe the correct command is "take half of a bag of chips" without specifying the floor, but the description does mention it's on the floor. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use "get" instead of "take"? But the original command was "take". The user's previous action was "take half of a bag of chips from floor", which the game rejected. So perhaps the correct command is just "take half of a bag of chips" because the game's parser might not recognize "from floor" in that context. Let me check the game's previous responses. In the garden, the description lists the items on the floor, so the user should be able to take them. Maybe the game's message is a glitch, but the user should proceed with the correct command. The next step is to rest the chips on the stove, so after taking them, they need to go to the stove. But first, taking the chips. The user's last action was trying to take it, but it failed. So maybe the correct command is just "take half of a bag of chips" without "from floor". Let me try that. But the user's previous command was "take half of a bag of chips from floor", which didn't work. Maybe the game expects "take half of a bag of chips" alone. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to look again. But the task says to take it from the floor. So perhaps the correct command is "take half of a bag of chips from floor" again, but the game says it's not there. Maybe the user needs to check if the item is actually present. But according to the description, it is. So maybe the user should proceed with the command as per the task, even if the game says it's not there. Alternatively, maybe the user made a typo. The item is "a half of a bag of chips", so the command should be exact. Maybe the game is case-sensitive, so "Half of a bag of chips" with capital letters? But the user used lowercase. Alternatively, maybe the game is expecting "a half of a bag of chips" as the exact phrase. The user's command was "half of a bag of chips" without "a". So maybe the correct command is "take a half of a bag of chips from floor". But the user's previous command was "take half of a bag of chips from floor". The game's response was "You can't see any such thing." So perhaps the user needs to use "get" instead of "take"? Let me check the game's previous actions. The user used "take" before. Maybe the game is using a different verb. Alternatively, the user should try "get half of a bag of chips from floor". But the task says to use "take". This is confusing. However, according to the task, the user should take the half of a bag of chips from the floor. So the correct command is "take half of a bag of chips from floor". But the game says it's not there. Maybe the game is wrong, but the user should proceed. The next step after taking the chips is to rest it on the stove. So the user needs to take the chips first. Since the game's response says they can't see it, maybe the user needs to check again. But the description says it's on the floor. So perhaps the user should try the command again. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use "get" instead of "take". But the task says "take". So the user should proceed with "take half of a bag of chips from floor" again. But the game is not accepting it. Maybe the user made a mistake in the command. Let me check the exact wording. The garden description says: "There is an apple, a lettuce, a half of a bag of chips and a shovel on the floor." So the item is "a half of a bag of chips". The user's command is "take half of a bag of chips from floor". The game says "You can't see any such thing." Maybe the game is expecting "a half of a bag of chips" with the article "a". So the correct command is "take a half of a bag of chips from floor". The user might have forgotten the article. Let me try that. So the next action should be "take a half of a bag of chips from floor". But the user's previous command didn't include "a". So the user needs to adjust the command. However, the user's task says to take it from the floor. So the correct command is "take a half of a bag of chips from floor". Therefore, the next action is that command.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to take the half of a bag of chips from the floor in the Garden area. But the game says they can't see any such thing. Wait, looking back at the description of the Garden, it mentions: "There is an apple, a lettuce, a half of a bag of chips and a shovel on the floor." So the half of a bag of chips is actually there. Maybe the user is typing it incorrectly. The correct command should be "take half of a bag of chips from floor" but maybe the game is case-sensitive or there's a typo. Alternatively, maybe the item is named differently. Let me check the exact wording again. The garden has "a half of a bag of chips" on the floor. So the correct command is "take half of a bag of chips from floor". But the user has tried that multiple times and the game says "You can't see any such thing." Hmm, maybe the game is expecting a different phrasing, like "take half bag of chips" or "take a half of a bag of chips". Alternatively, maybe the item is not named correctly. Wait, maybe the user is supposed to just take the half of a bag of chips without specifying "from floor" because the command is "take [item]" and the location is implied. But according to the game's previous commands, when taking items, sometimes you need to specify the location. For example, in the Kitchen, the user had to "take a note from kitchen island". So maybe here, the correct command is "take half of a bag of chips from floor". But the game is not recognizing it. Maybe the game is case-sensitive, so "half of a bag of chips" should be lowercase? Or maybe the item is named "half of a bag of chips" exactly as written. Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to use "take half of a bag of chips" without specifying the floor, but the game requires the location. Since the user has tried "take half of a bag of chips from floor" and it's not working, maybe the game is expecting a different command. Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to use "take half of a bag of chips" and the game will automatically know it's on the floor. But in the previous example, the user had to specify the location. So perhaps the correct command is "take half of a bag of chips from floor". But the game is not accepting it. Maybe the game is expecting "take half of a bag of chips" without the "from floor" part. Let me check the previous interactions. When the user was in the Kitchen, they had to "take a note from kitchen island". So in that case, the location was specified. Similarly, in the Garden, the item is on the floor, so the command should be "take half of a bag of chips from floor". But the game is saying "You can't see any such thing." Maybe the game is not recognizing the item's name. Let me check the exact description again. The Garden has "an apple, a lettuce, a half of a bag of chips and a shovel on the floor." So the item is "a half of a bag of chips". So the correct command is "take half of a bag of chips from floor". But the user has tried that and it's not working. Maybe the game is expecting "take a half of a bag of chips from floor". The user might have missed the article "a". So perhaps the correct command is "take a half of a bag of chips from floor". Let me try that. If the user types "take a half of a bag of chips from floor", the game might accept it. Alternatively, maybe the game is case-sensitive and the item is named "half of a bag of chips" without the article. But in the description, it's "a half of a bag of chips". So the correct command should include the article. Therefore, the user should try "take a half of a bag of chips from floor". However, the user has already tried that and the game says "You can't see any such thing." Maybe the game is not recognizing the item. Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to use a different command, like "get half of a bag of chips from floor". But the game's previous commands use "take". Alternatively, maybe the item is not named correctly. Wait, maybe the game is expecting "half of a bag of chips" without the article. Let me check the exact wording again. The Garden description says: "There is an apple, a lettuce, a half of a bag of chips and a shovel on the floor." So the item is "a half of a bag of chips". Therefore, the correct command is "take a half of a bag of chips from floor". But the user has tried that and it's not working. Maybe the game is not accepting that. Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to just take the item without specifying the location, but the game requires it. In that case, the correct command is "take half of a bag of chips from floor". But the game is not recognizing it. Maybe the user is supposed to use a different verb, like "pick up" instead of "take". But the game's previous commands use "take". Alternatively, maybe the game is expecting "take half of a bag of chips" without the "from floor" part, but that's not correct based on previous examples. Since the user is stuck here, the next step is to try the correct command again, ensuring that the article "a" is included. So the correct command should be "take a half of a bag of chips from floor". If that doesn't work, maybe the game is expecting a different phrasing. But based on the information given, that's the correct command.

Okay, the user is trying to take the half of a bag of chips from the floor in the Garden area. But the game keeps saying "You can't see any such thing." Let me check the previous messages.

Looking back, when the user was in the Garden, the description mentioned: "There is an apple, a lettuce, a half of a bag of chips and a shovel on the floor." So the chips are indeed there. But the user's command is "take half of a bag of chips from floor" which might not be the correct syntax. Maybe the game expects just "take half of a bag of chips" without specifying the floor, since the location is already known. Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "take half of a bag of chips" and the floor is implied. The user has been repeatedly trying to include "from floor," which might be redundant or incorrect. The game's response suggests that the item is not visible, but according to the description, it is there. Maybe the game's parser is case-sensitive or expects a different phrasing. The user needs to try a different command, perhaps just "take half of a bag of chips" without the "from floor" part. Let me check the previous attempts. The user tried "take half of a bag of chips from floor" multiple times, but the game didn't recognize it. So the correct command is likely "take half of a bag of chips" alone. The user should try that.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to rest the half of a bag of chips on the stove. The previous action was taking the chips from the floor. Now, they need to place it on the stove. The correct command should be "put half of a bag of chips on stove" or something similar. Since the game might expect a specific phrasing, maybe "rest" isn't the right verb here. The user tried "rest" but got an error. So the next step is to use the correct verb, probably "put". Let me check the previous interactions. The user said "rest the half of a bag of chips on the stove" but got an error. The system said "That's not a verb I recognise." So "rest" isn't valid. The correct verb is likely "put". So the next action should be "put half of a bag of chips on stove".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to put the half of a bag of chips on the stove. Earlier, they took the chips from the floor. Now, they need to place it on the stove. The problem is that the game says "You can't see any such thing." So maybe the stove isn't in the current location.

Wait, the current location is the Garden. Let me check the previous descriptions. In the Garden, the items on the floor are an apple, lettuce, half of a bag of chips, and a shovel. The stove wasn't mentioned there. But earlier, in the Kitchen, there was a stove. So maybe the user is in the Garden, but the stove is in the Kitchen. So the user can't put the chips on the stove here because the stove isn't present in the Garden.

So the correct action would be to go back to the Kitchen where the stove is located. The user needs to go north from the Garden to reach the Kitchen again. Then, they can put the chips on the stove. But the user's last action was trying to put the chips on the stove in the Garden, which isn't possible. Therefore, the next step should be to go north to the Kitchen and then put the chips on the stove there. But the user hasn't moved north yet. So the next command should be "go north" to move to the Kitchen, then "put half of a bag of chips on stove".

Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a patio table. The patio table is normal. But the thing is empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the patio table.

There is an open screen door leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to complete a series of tasks in this text-based game. They've already done a lot of the steps: opened the chest drawer, took the old key, unlocked the door, opened the wooden door, went east to the kitchen, opened the screen door, went east again to the backyard, then south to the garden. In the garden, they picked up the half-bag of chips and now need to put it on the stove.

But when they tried to "rest half of a bag of chips on stove," it didn't work. Then they tried "put half of a bag of chips on stove," which also failed. The error messages say "You can't see any such thing." So maybe the stove isn't in the current location. The user then tried going north, which took them back to the backyard, then west to the kitchen.

Now, in the kitchen, the user is at the kitchen again. The task was to put the half-bag of chips on the stove. But in the kitchen, the stove is mentioned as being ordinary but without anything on it. However, the user is in the kitchen now, so maybe the stove is here. But earlier, when they were in the garden, they picked up the chips, and now they're in the kitchen. So the chips are in their inventory, right? So the next step should be to put them on the stove in the kitchen.

But the user tried "put half of a bag of chips on stove" and got an error. Maybe the correct command is "put the half of a bag of chips on the stove" or "put the half-bag of chips on the stove." Alternatively, maybe the stove is called something else, like "stove" or "oven." Or perhaps the user needs to first go to the stove's location.

Wait, in the kitchen description, the stove is mentioned as being ordinary but without anything on it. So the user is in the kitchen, and the stove is here. The user has the half-bag of chips. So the correct action should be to put the chips on the stove. But the previous attempt failed. Maybe the game expects the exact phrase "put the half of a bag of chips on the stove" or similar. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use "put" without the article, like "put half of a bag of chips on stove."

But the user tried "put half of a bag of chips on stove" and got an error. Maybe the game is case-sensitive or expects a different phrasing. Alternatively, maybe the stove is not in the current room. Wait, the user is in the kitchen, and the stove is in the kitchen. So the user should be able to put the chips on the stove here.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to first go to the stove's location. But in the kitchen, the stove is already present. So the correct command should be "put half of a bag of chips on stove." But the game says "You can't see any such thing." Maybe the chips are not in the user's inventory? Wait, the user picked them up in the garden, so they should be holding them. But maybe the game requires the user to use the correct noun form. For example, "put the half of a bag of chips on the stove."

But the user's previous attempt was "put half of a bag of chips on stove," which failed. So maybe the correct command is "put the half of a bag of chips on the stove." However, the user is supposed to only output the command, not the explanation. So the next action should be "put the half of a bag of chips on the stove." But the user is in the kitchen now, so that's the right place.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use "place" instead of "put." But the game might only accept "put." Alternatively, maybe the stove is not in the current room. But the kitchen description says the stove is ordinary and there, so it should be there.

So the correct next action is to put the chips on the stove in the kitchen. Therefore, the command should be "put half of a bag of chips on stove." But the game says it's not possible. Maybe the user needs to use "put the" instead of "put." So the correct command is "put the half of a bag of chips on the stove." But the user is supposed to only output the command, not the explanation. So the answer is "put the half of a bag of chips on the stove." But the user might have to adjust the phrasing.
