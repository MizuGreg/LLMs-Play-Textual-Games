Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, doublecheck that the antique trunk in the bedroom is open. Then, pick up the old key from the antique trunk. Then, make it so that the wooden door within the bedroom is unlocked. Then, open the wooden door. After opening the wooden door, venture east. Then, open the screen door. Then, make an attempt to head east. That done, take a trip south. Then, pick up the milk from the floor of the garden. After getting the milk, try to head north. That done, attempt to take a trip west. Then, sit the milk on the stove in the kitchen. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Bedroom =-
You find yourself in a bedroom. An usual one. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You can see a chest drawer. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's an antique trunk. Were you looking for a king-size bed? Because look over there, it's a king-size bed. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me see. The user has been following the steps given. First, they checked the antique trunk in the bedroom, opened it, picked up the old key. Then they needed to unlock the wooden door in the bedroom. The next step after getting the key would be to use it to unlock the door.

Wait, the current location is the bedroom. The wooden door is closed and leading east. The user has the key, so they should try to unlock the door with the key. The next action should be to unlock the door. But in the game's context, maybe the command is "unlock wooden door" or "use key on wooden door". But the previous actions were "open antique trunk" and "pick up old key". So the next logical step is to unlock the door with the key. Let me check the previous messages. The user was told to "make it so that the wooden door within the bedroom is unlocked" after picking up the key. So the next action should be to unlock the door. The correct command would be "unlock wooden door". But I need to make sure that's the right action here. Alternatively, maybe "use key on wooden door". But the game might expect "unlock wooden door" as the command. Let me confirm based on the previous interactions. The user was told to "make it so that the wooden door... is unlocked", so the action would be to unlock it. So the next command is "unlock wooden door".

Okay, let's see. The user has opened the wooden door leading east. The next step according to the original instructions was to "venture east" after opening the door. So now that the door is open, they should move east. The command would be "go east" or "venture east". The game might expect "go east" as the command. Let me check the previous actions. The user was told to "venture east" after opening the door, so maybe "go east" is the correct command here. So the next action is "go east".

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.

You make out a closed refrigerator in the corner. You make out a counter. The counter is normal. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a stove. The stove is ordinary. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can see a kitchen island. Now why would someone leave that there? On the kitchen island you see a note. You shudder, but continue examining the room.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the kitchen now. They opened the screen door east. The next step according to the original plan was to "make an attempt to head east" after opening the screen door. So now they should try to go east. The command would be "go east". The screen door is open, so moving east through it makes sense. The previous action was opening the screen door, so the next step is to venture east. The correct command here is "go east".

-= Backyard =-
You've just sauntered into a backyard.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a set of chairs. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Sometimes, just sometimes, TextWorld can just be the worst. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a bbq. But the thing is empty. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a patio table. But the thing is empty.

There is an open screen door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a lettuce, a milk, a half of a bag of chips and a shovel on the floor.

Okay, the user is in the garden now. The original goal was to pick up the milk from the floor of the garden. The current room (Garden) has a milk on the floor. So the next step is to pick up the milk. The command would be "pick up milk". Let me check the previous steps. The user was told to "pick up the milk from the floor of the garden" after opening the wooden door and venturing east. So yes, the next action is to pick up the milk.

Okay, let's see. The user has picked up the milk and now is in the Backyard again. The original goal was to "sit the milk on the stove in the kitchen." So after getting the milk, they needed to go back to the kitchen. But the current location is the Backyard. The previous step was going north from the Garden, which brought them back to the Backyard. Now, they need to find a way back to the kitchen. The Backyard has a screen door leading west, but that's where they came from. The exit to the south is unguarded, but that's the Garden. Wait, maybe they need to go west through the screen door back to the Kitchen? But the Kitchen was earlier. Let me check the previous rooms. The user was in the Kitchen, then went east to the Backyard. So to get back to the Kitchen, they should go west from the Backyard. But the screen door is open west. So the next action should be "go west" to return to the Kitchen. Then, once in the Kitchen, they can put the milk on the stove. But the current step is after going north from the Garden to Backyard. The user needs to go west to get back to the Kitchen. So the correct command here is "go west".
