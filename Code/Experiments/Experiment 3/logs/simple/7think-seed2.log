You are now playing a exciting game of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First stop, assure that the chest drawer in the bedroom is wide open. And then, pick up the old key from the chest drawer inside the bedroom. Then, check that the wooden door is unlocked with the old key. After unlocking the wooden door, assure that the wooden door is wide open. After that, head east. Then, ensure that the screen door in the kitchen is open. Then, make an attempt to move east. With that accomplished, make an attempt to head south. Then, pick-up the lettuce from the floor of the garden. Then, travel north. Then, try to take a trip west. Then, rest the lettuce on the stove inside the kitchen. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Bedroom =-
You arrive in a bedroom. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You make out a chest drawer. What's that over there? It looks like it's an antique trunk. Were you looking for a king-size bed? Because look over there, it's a king-size bed. The king-size bed is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

You see a closed refrigerator. What's that over there? It looks like it's a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is ordinary. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? Oh, great. Here's a bbq. The bbq appears to be empty. Hm. Oh well Look over there! a patio table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the patio table.

There is an open screen door leading west. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game and has followed a series of steps to reach the backyard. The current score is 7/8, and they're asking if they're on the right track and what their next move should be.

First, I need to recall the original task. The goal was to: open the chest drawer in the bedroom, pick up the old key, unlock and open the wooden door, go east to the kitchen, open the screen door, go east again to the backyard, then pick up lettuce in the garden, travel north, try west, rest the lettuce on the stove, and finally stop.

So far, the user has done all the steps up to opening the screen door in the kitchen and moving east to the backyard. The next step in the original plan was to ensure the screen door in the kitchen is open (which they did), then try to move east. But after moving east, they ended up in the backyard. The next step according to the original task was to pick up the lettuce from the garden. However, the current location is the backyard, which doesn't mention a garden. Wait, maybe the garden is part of the backyard? Or perhaps there's a mistake in the steps.

Looking at the environment descriptions: in the backyard, there's a patio table, chairs, bbq, but no mention of a garden or lettuce. The user's next step was supposed to be picking up the lettuce from the garden. But in the current location (backyard), there's no lettuce. So maybe the user needs to check if the garden is elsewhere. Alternatively, maybe the lettuce is in the kitchen or another area.

Wait, the original task said: "pick-up the lettuce from the floor of the garden." So the user needs to find the garden. In the current location (backyard), there's no garden mentioned. The user might need to go north from the backyard, as the kitchen's north entrance is unblocked. Wait, in the kitchen, the user was told to try going north. But after moving east from the kitchen, they ended up in the backyard. So perhaps the garden is in the north direction from the backyard? Or maybe the user needs to check the kitchen again.

Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the steps. Let me retrace:

After opening the screen door in the kitchen (step 6/7), they went east to the backyard (step 7/8). The next step in the original task was to pick up the lettuce from the garden. But in the backyard, there's no garden. So maybe the user needs to go back to the kitchen and try going north, which was mentioned as unblocked. The kitchen's north entrance is unblocked, so maybe that leads to the garden. Let me check the kitchen's description again.

In the kitchen, the user was told: "You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded." So going north from the kitchen is possible. So perhaps the user should go back to the kitchen, go north, and then find the garden there. But the user is currently in the backyard. So the next step would be to go west back to the kitchen, then north to the garden.

But according to the original plan, after moving east to the backyard (step 7/8), the next step was to pick up the lettuce from the garden. Since the user is in the backyard and can't find the lettuce there, they need to find the garden. So the correct next action would be to go north from the backyard, which was mentioned as unguarded. Wait, in the backyard description, it says: "You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south." So the user is in the backyard, and the south direction is unguarded. But the original plan says after the backyard, the user should go north. Wait, maybe the user needs to go back to the kitchen and then north.

Alternatively, maybe the garden is in the kitchen. But the user hasn't checked that yet. The original task says to pick up the lettuce from the garden, so the user needs to find the garden. Since the current location is the backyard, and the garden isn't there, the user should go back to the kitchen and then go north. So the next step would be to go west from the backyard back to the kitchen, then north to the garden.

But the user's next action should be based on the current location. The user is in the backyard. The next step in the original plan was to pick up the lettuce from the garden. So the user needs to find the garden. Since the backyard doesn't have a garden, the user must go back to the kitchen and then go north. Therefore, the next action is to go west back to the kitchen, then north. But according to the game's current state, the user is in the backyard. The possible directions from the backyard are west (to the kitchen) and south (which is unguarded). So the user should go west to the kitchen, then north to the garden.

But the user's next action should be the immediate next step. The user is in the backyard, so the next action is to go west to the kitchen. Then, from the kitchen, go north to the garden. So the correct next command is "go west" to return to the kitchen.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in the TextWorld game. So far, they've opened the chest drawer, picked up the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, went east to the kitchen, opened the screen door, went east again to the backyard, then west back to the kitchen. Now they're stuck trying to find the lettuce in the kitchen.

The original goal was to pick up the lettuce from the floor of the garden. Wait, but in the kitchen, the user is looking for it. Maybe there's a mistake here. Let me check the previous steps. Oh, the user was in the backyard, then went west back to the kitchen. But the lettuce is supposed to be in the garden. Maybe they didn't go to the garden yet. Wait, the steps said after unlocking the door and opening it, they went east to the kitchen. Then after some actions, they went west again. So maybe they haven't reached the garden yet.

Wait, the user's current location is the kitchen. The next step was supposed to be traveling north after trying to take a trip west. But maybe they didn't do that. Let me retrace. After the kitchen, the user was in the backyard, then went west back to the kitchen. Now, they need to go north from the kitchen. The kitchen has an unguarded entranceway north. So the next step should be going north to reach the garden where the lettuce is. But the user is trying to pick up the lettuce in the kitchen, which is incorrect. So the correct action is to go north from the kitchen to the garden, then pick up the lettuce there. But the user is stuck looking in the kitchen. So the next action should be going north.

Well, here we are in a bathroom. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a sequence of actions in this text-based game. Their goal is to complete several tasks, including opening drawers, picking up items, unlocking doors, and moving between rooms. So far, they've managed to open the chest drawer in the bedroom, pick up the old key, unlock and open the wooden door, and move east to the kitchen. They then opened the screen door, went east to the backyard, and came back west to the kitchen again.

Now, the user is in the kitchen again, having tried multiple times to find the lettuce on the floor, but couldn't. They've looked under the stove, counter, kitchen island, and refrigerator without success. The next step in their original plan was to pick up the lettuce from the floor of the garden, but they're in the kitchen. Wait, maybe there's a confusion here. The original task said to pick up the lettuce from the garden, but the user is in the kitchen. Maybe they need to go to the garden first?

Wait, the user's last action was going south from the bathroom back to the kitchen. Now, they're stuck trying to find the lettuce in the kitchen. But according to the original plan, the lettuce is in the garden. So perhaps the user needs to go to the garden, which is east of the kitchen. But the screen door in the kitchen leads east to the backyard, which is where the garden might be. However, when they tried going east from the kitchen, they ended up in the backyard, but the lettuce isn't there either. The user tried looking around the backyard but didn't find it.

Wait, the original task says: "pick-up the lettuce from the floor of the garden." So the lettuce is in the garden, not the kitchen. The user is in the kitchen, so they need to go to the garden. But how? The kitchen has an open screen door leading east, which leads to the backyard. The backyard has an open screen door leading west back to the kitchen. But the user hasn't checked the garden area yet. Maybe the garden is part of the backyard? Or maybe there's another path.

Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the steps. Let me check the original plan again:

Original steps:
1. Open chest drawer in bedroom.
2. Pick up old key from chest drawer.
3. Unlock wooden door with key.
4. Open wooden door.
5. Go east (to kitchen).
6. Open screen door in kitchen.
7. Go east (to backyard).
8. Attempt to move east (maybe to garden?).
9. Attempt to move south.
10. Pick up lettuce from garden.
11. Travel north.
12. Try to take trip west.
13. Rest lettuce on stove in kitchen.

So after step 7, the user is in the backyard. Then step 8 is to attempt to move east. But in the backyard, the user tried going east and found nothing. Then they went west back to the kitchen. Now, they're stuck in the kitchen again, trying to find the lettuce. But the lettuce is supposed to be in the garden. So perhaps the user needs to go east from the backyard again to reach the garden. But when they tried that, they didn't find it. Maybe the lettuce is in a different location, or maybe the user needs to look more carefully.

Alternatively, maybe the user is missing a step. After step 7 (go east to backyard), step 8 is to attempt to move east. But in the backyard, there's no east exit. The user tried going east from the kitchen to the backyard, then from the backyard, maybe there's another exit. Wait, in the backyard description, the user sees a patio table, chairs, bbq, but no mention of a garden. Maybe the garden is part of the backyard, but the lettuce is on the floor there. The user tried looking around the backyard but didn't find it. Maybe they need to check under something else in the backyard.

But the user is currently in the kitchen, having come back from the backyard. They need to go east again from the kitchen to the backyard, then perhaps check the garden area. However, the user's last action was going south from the bathroom back to the kitchen, and now they're stuck trying to find the lettuce in the kitchen. This suggests that the user might have a misunderstanding of where the lettuce is. The original plan says the lettuce is in the garden, not the kitchen. Therefore, the user needs to go to the garden, which is probably in the backyard. But they haven't found it yet. Maybe they need to check the backyard again, or perhaps there's a different path.

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go north from the kitchen. The kitchen has an unguarded entranceway north. If they go north from the kitchen, perhaps they reach the garden. But in the kitchen description, the user is told to try going north. However, the user hasn't tried that yet. So maybe the next step is to go north from the kitchen to reach the garden where the lettuce is. But the user is currently in the kitchen, so the next action should be to go north. However, the user's previous attempts were to look around the kitchen and not find the lettuce. Therefore, the correct next step is to go north from the kitchen to the garden, then pick up the lettuce there.

-= Bathroom =-
Well, here we are in a bathroom. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You make out a closed toilet. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a bath. You see a sink. You see a toothbrush on the sink.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

You arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.

You see a closed refrigerator. What's that over there? It looks like it's a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is ordinary. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. What's the point of an empty counter? You can see a stove. The stove is usual. The stove appears to be empty. You see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is standard. On the kitchen island you make out a note. Hmmm... what else, what else?

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in the kitchen, looking for the lettuce. They've checked under the stove, counter, kitchen island, and refrigerator but found nothing. The original goal was to pick up the lettuce from the garden, but maybe they missed it.

Wait, the user had previously gone east from the kitchen, which led them to the backyard. Then they went west back to the kitchen. But the lettuce was supposed to be in the garden. Maybe they need to go south from the kitchen to reach the garden. The kitchen has a screen door leading east and a wooden door west, but the user has been going back and forth. The original instructions said after unlocking the door and opening it, they should head east, then check the screen door in the kitchen, then go east again. But maybe the garden is south of the kitchen. The user hasn't tried going south yet from the kitchen. The kitchen's description mentions an unguarded exit to the south. So perhaps the lettuce is in the garden, and the user needs to go south from the kitchen to get there. The user has been checking the kitchen's areas but hasn't ventured south. So the next step should be to go south from the kitchen to reach the garden where the lettuce is.

You arrive in a living room. A normal kind of place. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You smell a sickening smell, and follow it to a couch. On the couch you see a milk. You scan the room, seeing a low table. You see a remote on the low table. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can see a tv. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The tv appears to be empty. Hm. Oh well

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in a text-based game. Their goal is to complete various tasks like opening drawers, picking up items, unlocking doors, and moving between rooms. So far, they've managed to open the chest drawer, get the old key, unlock and open the wooden door, go east to the kitchen, open the screen door, and go east again to the backyard. Then they tried to find the lettuce in the kitchen but couldn't, leading them to check various places without success. They ended up in the bathroom, then back to the kitchen, and then the living room.

Now, the user is back in the kitchen again, and they've tried looking around, under the table, couch, and TV without finding the lettuce. The next step according to the original task was to pick up the lettuce from the floor of the garden. Wait, but the user is in the kitchen now. Maybe they went west from the backyard back to the kitchen, but the lettuce is supposed to be in the garden. However, in the current scenario, the user is in the kitchen and hasn't found the lettuce yet. The task says to pick up the lettuce from the garden, but the user is in the kitchen. So perhaps they need to go back to the garden via the screen door they opened earlier.

But in the current state, the user is in the kitchen, and the last action was looking around again. The user might need to go back to the backyard through the screen door (east) and then find the lettuce in the garden. However, the original instruction said to pick up the lettuce from the garden's floor. But in the kitchen, the user hasn't found it yet. Maybe the lettuce is in the garden, but the user hasn't gone there yet. So the next step would be to go east from the kitchen through the screen door to the backyard, then check the garden area for the lettuce. But the user is currently in the kitchen, so the next action should be to go east to the backyard. However, the user might have already been there. Alternatively, maybe the lettuce is in the kitchen, but the user hasn't found it yet. But according to the task, it's in the garden. So the user needs to go to the garden.

But the user is in the kitchen, and the screen door is open east. So the next action should be to go east to the backyard, then check the garden area. However, the user's last action was looking around in the kitchen, which didn't find anything. So the next step is to go east to the backyard, then look for the lettuce there. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the correct next action is to go east from the kitchen to the backyard.

Okay, let me try to figure out what to do next. The user wants to rest the lettuce on the stove inside the kitchen. But in the current location, which is the backyard, they can't directly interact with the kitchen's stove. So, first, they need to go back to the kitchen.

Looking at the previous steps, the user was in the garden, picked up the lettuce, then went back to the backyard. Now, they need to get back to the kitchen. The backyard has an open screen door leading west, which probably leads back to the kitchen. So the next step should be to go west from the backyard to get back to the kitchen. Once there, they can rest the lettuce on the stove. But since the current location is the backyard, the immediate action is to go west. Let me check the previous movements. Yes, the user was in the backyard and the kitchen is west from there. So the correct command is "go west".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to rest the lettuce on the stove in the kitchen. But the game is saying that's not a recognized verb. Hmm. So maybe the correct command is different. Let me think about the possible commands here.

In TextWorld, actions are usually verbs that match the objects in the environment. The user has the lettuce, and they need to place it on the stove. The previous attempts used "rest lettuce on stove", but that didn't work. Maybe the correct verb is "put" instead of "rest"? Or perhaps "place"?

Wait, the user tried "rest lettuce on stove" and it didn't work. Then they tried "rest lettuce on stove in kitchen", which also didn't work. Maybe the correct command is "put lettuce on stove". Let me check the possible actions again.

Alternatively, maybe the stove is considered a container, so the correct action is "put lettuce on stove". Or maybe "place lettuce on stove". The game might expect a specific verb. Since "rest" isn't working, perhaps "put" is the right verb here. Let me try that.
