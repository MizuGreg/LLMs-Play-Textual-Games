Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First, it would be great if you could assure that the chest drawer is ajar. Then, take the old key from the chest drawer. If you can get your hands on the old key, unlock the wooden door. And then, make it so that the wooden door is ajar. And then, move east. With that over with, ensure that the screen door is open. And then, make an attempt to move east. Next, go to the south. After that, lift the lettuce from the floor of the garden. After that, go north. Okay, and then, venture west. That done, rest the lettuce on the stove. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Bedroom =-
You're now in the bedroom. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You can make out a closed chest drawer. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than an antique trunk, so there's that. You scan the room, seeing a king-size bed. The king-size bed is typical. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps given in the initial instructions. They started by opening the chest drawer, taking the old key, then the next step was to unlock the wooden door. The user hasn't done that yet. So the next logical step after taking the key would be to use it to unlock the door. The goal was to unlock the door and then move east. So the next action should be to unlock the wooden door with the key. Then, after that, move east as instructed. The user's current score is 2/3, so they need to proceed with the remaining steps. The answer should be "unlock wooden door" since that's the next step in the sequence.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps given in the initial instructions. They started by opening the chest drawer, taking the old key, unlocking the wooden door, and opening it. Now they're at the fourth step, which was to move east. The next steps in the original plan were to ensure the screen door is open, move east again, go south, pick up the lettuce, go north, venture west, rest the lettuce on the stove, and then win.

Wait, the current location after opening the wooden door leading east would be in the next room. The user's last action was opening the wooden door, so they should now be in the room east of the bedroom. The next step according to the original plan was to move east. But the user's next action should be moving east. However, the user's last action was opening the wooden door, so the next command should be "go east". But the user's previous action was "open wooden door", which might have already moved them into the next room. Wait, maybe the wooden door was closed and after unlocking and opening it, they can now go through it. So the next step is to move east. But the user's next action is to move east. However, the user's last action was "open wooden door", so the next command would be "go east". But the user's next action is to move east. However, the user's current location is after opening the door, so they need to go through it. So the next command is "go east".

You've come into an ordinary room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be ordinary. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the kitchen. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You make out a refrigerator. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a counter, go to TextWorld. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Were you looking for a stove? Because look over there, it's a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? The stove appears to be empty. You move on, clearly infuriated by TextWorld. You scan the room for a kitchen island, and you find a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in this text-based game. So far, they've opened the chest drawer, taken the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, then went east into the kitchen. Now, in the kitchen, there's a screen door leading east that's closed. The user tried to go east but was told they need to open the screen door first.

The original goal was to ensure the screen door is open, then move east again. So the next logical step is to open the screen door. The user's previous action was "go east", which wasn't possible because the door was closed. The correct action now is to open the screen door. Let me check the available commands. The user is in the kitchen, and the screen door is closed. So the next command should be "open screen door". That makes sense. The user needs to open it before proceeding east again.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps given in the initial instructions. They started in the bedroom, opened the chest drawer, took the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, then went east to the kitchen. From there, they opened the screen door and went east again to the backyard.

Now, the current location is the backyard. The next step in the original plan was to "move east" after opening the screen door. But in the backyard, the open screen door leads west back to the kitchen. The user is told to try going south from the backyard. However, the original goal mentioned moving east after certain steps. Wait, let me check the original instructions again.

The original tasks were: assure the chest drawer is ajar, take the old key, unlock and open the wooden door, move east, ensure the screen door is open, move east again, go south, lift the lettuce from the garden, go north, venture west, then rest the lettuce on the stove. 

But in the current scenario, after the backyard, the user is at the backyard. The next step according to the user's previous actions was to move east, but the screen door is already open west. The user tried going east from the kitchen, which led to the backyard. Now, from the backyard, the possible directions are west (screen door) and south (unblocked). The original plan said after moving east (to the backyard), then go south. So the next step should be to go south from the backyard. The user's next action should be "go south" to proceed to the garden where the lettuce is located. Then lift the lettuce, go north, etc. So the correct next command is "go south".

Okay, the user tried to "lift lettuce from floor of garden" but the system said that's not a recognized verb. Let me check the possible commands. In TextWorld, the correct verb for picking up an object is "take" instead of "lift". So the correct command should be "take lettuce from floor". The user might have used "lift" instead of "take". Let me confirm that. Yes, "take" is the standard verb for picking up items. So the next action should be "take lettuce from floor".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in the TextWorld game. They've successfully opened the chest drawer, taken the key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, gone east to the kitchen, opened the screen door, went east again to the backyard, and then south to the garden. Now, in the garden, they need to lift the lettuce from the floor.

But the user tried "lift lettuce from floor" and got an error saying that's not a recognized verb. Then they tried "take lettuce from floor" again, but the system said they can't see any such thing. Wait, the game's description of the garden says there's a bell pepper, an apple, a lettuce, and a shovel on the floor. So the lettuce is there. Maybe the correct verb is "take" instead of "lift"? Or maybe "pick up"?

But the user tried "take lettuce from floor" and it didn't work. The game might be expecting a different command. Let me check the possible actions. In TextWorld, common verbs are "take", "put", "use", "open", "close", "look", etc. Since the lettuce is on the floor, the correct action is probably "take lettuce". But the user tried that and got "can't see any such thing". Wait, maybe the lettuce isn't visible? But the game says "there is a bell pepper, an apple, a lettuce and a shovel on the floor." So the lettuce is there. Maybe the correct command is "take lettuce" without the "from floor" part? Or maybe "pick up lettuce"?

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to first look around to confirm the lettuce's presence. But the user already saw the lettuce in the description. Hmm. The error message says "can't see any such thing", which suggests that the game's parser doesn't recognize "take lettuce from floor" as a valid command. Maybe the correct command is just "take lettuce". Let me try that. If the user says "take lettuce", the game might accept it. Alternatively, "pick up lettuce".

But the user's previous attempt was "take lettuce from floor", which didn't work. So maybe the correct command is "take lettuce". Let me check the game's possible commands again. The user is in the garden, and the items are on the floor. So the correct action is to take the lettuce. The error might be because the user included "from floor", which isn't necessary. So the next action should be "take lettuce".

Okay, let's see. The user has to follow a series of steps to win the game. So far, they've opened the chest drawer, taken the key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, went east to the kitchen, opened the screen door, went east to the backyard, then went south to the garden. In the garden, they lifted the lettuce (after some trial and error with the correct command). Then they went north back to the backyard.

Now, the next step according to the original instructions was to "rest the lettuce on the stove." But the user is currently in the backyard. The stove is in the kitchen. So they need to go back to the kitchen, then find the stove and place the lettuce there.

Looking at the current location (backyard), the possible exits are west (screen door) and south (unblocked). But the stove is in the kitchen, which is north of the backyard. Wait, earlier when they were in the kitchen, the exits were north, south, east, and west. But after moving east from the kitchen, they were in the backyard. So to get back to the kitchen, they need to go west from the backyard. But the screen door is open west, so going west would take them back to the kitchen. Then, in the kitchen, they can go north to the bedroom? Wait, no. The kitchen's exits are north, south, east, west. But the user is in the backyard, which is connected to the kitchen via the screen door (west). So from the backyard, going west leads back to the kitchen. Then, in the kitchen, the stove is there. So the next steps would be: go west to the kitchen, then go north to the bedroom? Wait, no. The original goal was to rest the lettuce on the stove. So once in the kitchen, they need to find the stove and put the lettuce there.

But in the kitchen description, the stove is mentioned as being empty. So the user has the lettuce, so they need to go to the stove in the kitchen and place it there. Then, after that, they would have completed all the steps and won.

So the current location is the backyard. The next step is to go west back to the kitchen. Then, in the kitchen, go to the stove and put the lettuce there. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the correct next action is to go west from the backyard to the kitchen. Then, in the kitchen, the command would be to put the lettuce on the stove. But the user is currently in the backyard, so the next command should be "go west" to reach the kitchen.
