Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. Your first objective is to open the chest drawer within the bedroom. After that, recover the old key from the chest drawer. Then, unlock the wooden door within the bedroom. And then, assure that the wooden door is ajar. After opening the wooden door, attempt to move east. Then, make sure that the screen door inside the kitchen is ajar. After pulling open the screen door, take a trip east. Following that, make an effort to venture south. With that accomplished, pick up the milk from the floor of the garden. Then, head north. Next, try to go west. With that accomplished, rest the milk on the stove. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Bedroom =-
You arrive in a bedroom. A standard one.

Were you looking for a chest drawer? Because look over there, it's a chest drawer. You can see a closed antique trunk. Look over there! a king-size bed. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user has already opened the chest drawer and taken the old key. The next step according to the instructions was to unlock the wooden door in the bedroom. So after taking the key, the next logical step is to use the key to unlock the door. The user mentioned that after unlocking the door, they need to make sure it's ajar. So the immediate action here is to try unlocking the door with the key they just retrieved. The command should be "unlock wooden door".

Wait, but in the previous steps, the user was told to "unlock the wooden door within the bedroom" after recovering the key. So yes, the next step is definitely unlocking the door. The user has the key now, so they can proceed to unlock it. The response should be "unlock wooden door".

Okay, the user tried to say "make sure wooden door is ajar" but the system said that's not a recognized verb. So I need to think of another way to check if the door is ajar. The previous action was unlocking the door, so maybe the next step is to check the state of the door. But the valid commands here are likely "open" or "check" or something similar. Since the user has to use commands that are allowed, maybe "open wooden door" is the correct action here. Alternatively, maybe "check wooden door" or "examine wooden door". But in the context of the game, after unlocking, the door should be open. Wait, the original instruction said to "assure that the wooden door is ajar", so maybe the correct command is "open wooden door" to ensure it's open. But the user already unlocked it. Hmm. Maybe the game expects "open" even if it's already unlocked. Alternatively, maybe "check" is the verb. But the user's previous action was "unlock", so perhaps the next step is to "open" the door. Let me check the possible commands. The user is in the bedroom, after unlocking the door. The correct command here would be "open wooden door" to make sure it's ajar. So the next action should be "open wooden door".

You see a refrigerator. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a counter. The counter is usual. But there isn't a thing on it. You make out a stove. The stove is normal. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is normal. On the kitchen island you see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the kitchen now. The next steps according to the original instructions were: after opening the wooden door in the bedroom, move east to the kitchen, then make sure the screen door is ajar, pull it open, then go east again, venture south, pick up the milk in the garden, head north, go west, and put the milk on the stove.

So far, the user has opened the screen door in the kitchen. The current location is the kitchen. The next step mentioned was "make sure that the screen door inside the kitchen is ajar. After pulling open the screen door, take a trip east." Wait, but the user just pulled open the screen door, so the next action should be to go east. But the user is already in the kitchen. The screen door is leading east, so maybe the user needs to open it and then go through. But the screen door is already open? Wait, the description says "a closed screen door leading east." Wait, no, the user just pulled it open. So the screen door is now open. So the next step is to go east through the screen door. But the user is in the kitchen, and the screen door is east. So the command would be "go east". But the user is in the kitchen, and the screen door is east. So the next action is to go east. But the user just did that?

So in the kitchen, the screen door is closed, so the user needs to open it. But the user just pulled it open, so now it's open. Then the next step is to go east. But the user is in the kitchen, so going east would lead to the next area. But the kitchen's east is the screen door. Wait, maybe the user is in the kitchen, and the screen door is east. So after opening it, the user should go east. But the user is already in the kitchen. So the next command is "go east" to move through the screen door.
