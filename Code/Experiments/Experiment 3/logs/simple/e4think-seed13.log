I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is how to play! First, it would be great if you could ensure that the chest drawer within the bedroom is open. And then, retrieve the old key from the chest drawer. And then, unlock the wooden door with the old key. And then, ensure that the wooden door within the bedroom is open. And then, make an attempt to go east. And then, open the screen door. After opening the screen door, make an effort to go to the east. Then, take a trip south. And then, retrieve the bell pepper from the floor of the garden. If you can get your hands on the bell pepper, head north. Then, travel west. After that, rest the bell pepper on the stove. Got that? Good!

-= Bedroom =-
You're now in the bedroom. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You can make out a chest drawer. You can see a closed antique trunk. You make out a king-size bed. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Hm. Oh well

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this TextWorld game and has followed a set of steps. So far, they've opened the chest drawer, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door, and the score has increased each time. The next step in their plan was to ensure the wooden door is open, which they just did by unlocking it. Now they need to attempt to go east.

Wait, the user's next action after unlocking the door should be to go east. But the current prompt says "Do you think you're making the right actions..." so they need to confirm if they're on the right track. The user is asking if they're close to the goal. Since they've unlocked the door, the next logical step is to go through it. But the user might need to check if the door is open, but the game already unlocked it. So the next command should be "go east" to move through the door. The user's previous action was unlocking the door, so the next step is to go east. The answer should be "go east".

You've just sauntered into a kitchen.

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a refrigerator. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a counter. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. You make out a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. The stove is ordinary. The stove appears to be empty. You can see a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

-= Bathroom =-
You arrive in a bathroom. A normal kind of place.

You make out a toilet, so there's that. You can see a closed bath. You can make out a sink. The sink is standard. On the sink you can make out a toothbrush.

You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Bathroom now. The previous steps were going through the wooden door east into the Kitchen, then going north into the Bathroom. The original goal was to retrieve the bell pepper from the garden and then do some actions. But so far, the user has been moving between rooms, opening doors, and collecting the old key. The current location is the Bathroom.

The user's next action should be to go south back to the Kitchen, since the Bathroom's south exit is unblocked. The original plan was to go east from the Bedroom, open the screen door, go east again, then south to the garden. But maybe the user needs to check the Kitchen again for any items or clues. However, in the Kitchen, the only note was on the island, but nothing else. The user hasn't gone to the garden yet. Wait, the original plan was after opening the screen door, go east, then take a trip south to the garden. But in the current path, the user is in the Bathroom. So maybe they need to go back to the Kitchen, then check the screen door again. But the screen door was already opened earlier? Or maybe the user needs to go from the Bathroom south back to the Kitchen, then try going east again through the screen door. Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go from the Kitchen north again to the Bedroom, but that's not part of the original plan. Wait, the original steps after the bedroom were: unlock the door, go east, open screen door, go east, then south to garden. So perhaps the user is stuck in the Bathroom because they went north from the Kitchen. So the correct path is to go south from the Bathroom back to the Kitchen, then try going east again through the screen door. The user's next action should be to go south from the Bathroom to return to the Kitchen. Then, from the Kitchen, go east through the screen door, then east again, then south to the garden. So the immediate next step is to go south from the Bathroom.

If you're wondering why everything seems so ordinary all of a sudden, it's because you've just walked into the backyard. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You can see a set of chairs. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a set of chairs, go to TextWorld. The set of chairs is usual. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You see a bbq. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You swear loudly. You can see a patio table. Now why would someone leave that there? But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.

There is an open screen door leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

Okay, the user is in the Backyard now. The original goal was to retrieve the bell pepper from the garden. So far, they've navigated through the Bedroom, Kitchen, Bathroom, and now the Backyard. The Backyard has a patio table and chairs, but nothing on them. The user needs to find the bell pepper on the floor of the garden. Since the Backyard is south of the Kitchen, and the user is here, the next step is to go south to the garden. The prompt mentions that there's an unblocked exit to the south, so they should go there. Then, once in the garden, they can look for the bell pepper. The next action should be "go south".

Okay, the user is in the Garden and needs to take the bell pepper from the floor. They've tried "take bell pepper from floor" three times, but it's not working. Let me check the game description again. The garden has a half bag of chips, an apple, a bell pepper, and a shovel on the floor. The user might be trying to take the bell pepper but the command isn't correct. Maybe the correct command is just "take bell pepper" without specifying "from floor" since it's already on the floor. Alternatively, maybe the item is named differently. Wait, the game says "a bell pepper and a shovel on the floor." So the bell pepper is already on the floor, so the command should be "take bell pepper". Let me try that. The user's previous attempts were "take bell pepper from floor", which might be incorrect. The correct command is just "take bell pepper".

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, the user is in the Garden again. They tried to go north but got an error. The previous steps were: take the bell pepper, go south to Backyard, then go south again to Garden. Now, they need to find the stove to put the bell pepper on it. But the stove is in the Kitchen. So the correct path is to go north from the Garden to the Kitchen. The user's inventory has the bell pepper. The next action should be to go north to the Kitchen. But the user tried "go north" and got an error. Maybe the command is incorrect. The available commands include "go <dir>", so "go north" should work. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check the inventory again. But the goal is to put the bell pepper on the stove, which is in the Kitchen. So the next step is to go north to the Kitchen.

-= Backyard =-
If you're wondering why everything seems so ordinary all of a sudden, it's because you've just walked into the backyard. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You can see a set of chairs. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a set of chairs, go to TextWorld. The set of chairs is usual. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You see a bbq. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You swear loudly. You can see a patio table. Now why would someone leave that there? But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.

There is an open screen door leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

Okay, the user is stuck in the Backyard and can't go north. They tried "go north" but got an error. The available commands include "look", "goal", "inventory", etc. The user's inventory has the bell pepper. The original goal was to rest the bell pepper on the stove. The stove is in the Kitchen. The user needs to find a way back to the Kitchen. The Backyard has an open screen door leading west and an exit to the south. Maybe they should go west through the screen door to the Kitchen. Let me check the previous rooms. When the user was in the Kitchen, the screen door was closed but then opened. So maybe going west from the Backyard through the screen door leads back to the Kitchen. The correct command would be "go west" to move through the screen door back to the Kitchen. Then, from the Kitchen, they can find the stove and put the bell pepper on it. So the next action is "go west".

-= Kitchen =-
You've just sauntered into a kitchen.

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a refrigerator. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a counter. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. You make out a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. The stove is ordinary. The stove appears to be empty. You can see a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.
