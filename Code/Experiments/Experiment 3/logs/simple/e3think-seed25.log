Welcome to another profound episode of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First, it would be good if you could ensure that the chest drawer in the bedroom is open. Then, take the old key from the chest drawer. And then, make it so that the wooden door in the bedroom is unlocked with the old key. After that, ensure that the wooden door inside the bedroom is open. Then, go east. That done, ensure that the screen door in the kitchen is open. After pulling open the screen door, travel east. Then, move south. And then, retrieve the milk from the floor of the garden. Then, try to go to the north. Following that, move west. With that done, sit the milk on the stove. That's it!

-= Bedroom =-
You are in a bedroom. A normal kind of place.

You scan the room for a chest drawer, and you find a chest drawer. You can see an antique trunk. You make out a king-size bed. The king-size bed is ordinary. However, the king-size bed, like an empty king-size bed, has nothing on it.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me see. The user has been following the steps given in the initial instructions. They started by opening the chest drawer, taking the old key, unlocking the wooden door, and then opening it. Now, the next step according to the original plan was to ensure the wooden door inside the bedroom is open. Wait, the user just unlocked the door, but maybe they need to open it now. The current state shows the wooden door is unlocked, but maybe it's still closed. So the next action should be to open the door. Then, go east as instructed. Let me check the previous steps again.

The original steps said: after unlocking, ensure the door is open. So after unlocking, the user needs to open it. Then go east. So the next command should be "open wooden door". Then go east. But the user's last action was unlocking the door. The current prompt is after unlocking, so the next step is to open the door. Let me confirm the environment description. The wooden door in the bedroom is closed. So the user needs to open it. So the next action is "open wooden door".

-= Kitchen =-
You've just walked into a kitchen. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You can make out a refrigerator. Hey, want to see a counter? Look over there, a counter. The counter is standard. But the thing is empty. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You scan the room, seeing a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

You arrive in a backyard. An ordinary one.

You can make out a set of chairs. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You see a bbq. The bbq appears to be empty. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You can make out a patio table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The patio table appears to be empty.

There is an open screen door leading west. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

Okay, the user tried to take the milk from the floor, but the game said they can't see any such thing. Let me check the environment again. The garden has a lettuce, a milk, a half of a bag of chips, and a shovel on the floor. Wait, maybe the milk is there, but the user didn't see it. Maybe the command should be "take milk from floor" again. But the game said "can't see any such thing." Maybe the milk is not on the floor? Or maybe the correct command is just "take milk". Let me check the previous steps. The user was told to "retrieve the milk from the floor of the garden." So the correct action is to take the milk from the floor. But the game responded that it can't see any such thing. Maybe the milk is not there? Or maybe the user needs to look again. But according to the description, the milk is on the floor. Maybe the game is confused. Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "take milk" without specifying the floor. But the instruction says to take it from the floor. Hmm. Maybe the user should try "take milk" again. Alternatively, maybe the game has a typo. But the user's last action was "take milk from floor", which the game rejected. So the next step is to try taking the milk without specifying the floor, or maybe check again. But the user needs to follow the original plan. The original plan said to "retrieve the milk from the floor of the garden." So the correct command is "take milk from floor". But the game says it can't see it. Maybe the milk is not there. Wait, the description says "a lettuce, a milk, a half of a bag of chips and a shovel on the floor." So the milk is there. Maybe the game's response is wrong. But the user has to follow the commands. Maybe the correct action is "take milk" without the floor. Let me try that. So the next command should be "take milk".

Okay, let's see. The user has completed most of the steps. They retrieved the milk and are now back in the kitchen. The original goal was to sit the milk on the stove. So the next step is to go to the stove. But in the kitchen, the stove is mentioned as being empty. The user needs to put the milk on the stove. So the correct action is to go to the stove. But the current location is the kitchen, and the stove is present. The user has the milk, so they should go to the stove and put it there. The command would be "go to stove" or "go to the stove". But the game might expect a specific command. Alternatively, since the stove is in the kitchen, maybe the user just needs to go to the stove. So the next action is "go to stove".
