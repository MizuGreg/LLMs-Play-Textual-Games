I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is how to play! First, it would be great if you could ensure that the chest drawer within the bedroom is open. And then, retrieve the old key from the chest drawer. And then, unlock the wooden door with the old key. And then, ensure that the wooden door within the bedroom is open. And then, make an attempt to go east. And then, open the screen door. After opening the screen door, make an effort to go to the east. Then, take a trip south. And then, retrieve the bell pepper from the floor of the garden. If you can get your hands on the bell pepper, head north. Then, travel west. After that, rest the bell pepper on the stove. Got that? Good!

-= Bedroom =-
You're now in the bedroom. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You can make out a chest drawer. You can see a closed antique trunk. You make out a king-size bed. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Hm. Oh well

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing a text adventure game called TextWorld. They've been given a series of steps to follow. Let me recap what's happened so far.

First, they entered the bedroom and were told to open the chest drawer. They did that, found an old key. Then they tried to retrieve the key from the chest drawer, but the system said that's not a recognized verb. So maybe the key is already in the chest drawer after opening it. The user might have misunderstood the steps.

The original instructions said: open the chest drawer, retrieve the old key from the chest drawer, then unlock the wooden door with the key. But after opening the drawer, the key is inside. So the next step should be to take the key. But the user tried "retrieve old key from chest drawer", which the game didn't recognize. Maybe the correct verb is "take" instead of "retrieve". Or maybe the key is already in the chest drawer, so the user needs to pick it up.

Looking at the game's response after opening the drawer: "You open the chest drawer, revealing an old key." So the key is now in the chest drawer. The next step should be to take the key. The user tried "retrieve", which isn't a valid command. So the correct action is "take old key from chest drawer" or just "take old key".

But the game might have specific verbs. In many text adventures, "take" is the verb. So the user should use "take old key from chest drawer". But the system said "That's not a verb I recognise." So maybe the correct command is "take old key".

Alternatively, maybe after opening the drawer, the key is already in the inventory, so the user needs to pick it up. But the game's response didn't mention the key being picked up. So the user needs to take it.

So the next action should be "take old key from chest drawer" or "take old key". Since the game didn't recognize "retrieve", the correct verb is "take". Therefore, the next command is "take old key from chest drawer".

Okay, let's see. The user is in a text adventure game and has followed the steps correctly so far. They opened the chest drawer, took the old key, and unlocked the wooden door. The next step according to the original instructions was to ensure the wooden door is open, which they did by unlocking it. Then they needed to attempt to go east.

So after unlocking the door, the next logical step is to try going east. The user hasn't done that yet. The command would be "go east". The system should recognize that as a valid action. Let me check the previous steps again. The user was told to "make an attempt to go east" after unlocking the door. So the next action should be "go east".

Okay, let me figure out the next step here. The user has opened the wooden door, so now they need to proceed east as per the original instructions. The previous attempt to go east failed because the door wasn't open, but now it's open. So the next command should be "go east" again. The user has to make sure they move through the door into the next room. Since the door is open, going east should be possible now.

Wait, the user was in the bedroom, unlocked the door, and opened it. The next step is to go east, which would lead them into the next room, maybe the garden or another area. The original plan was to go east, then open the screen door, go east again, take the bell pepper, etc. So after opening the door, "go east" is the correct command here. The system should accept that.

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a refrigerator. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a counter. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. You make out a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. The stove is ordinary. The stove appears to be empty. You can see a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Kitchen now. The original plan was to go east after opening the screen door, but they're in the kitchen. The current room has a closed screen door east, open door west, and exits north and south. The user needs to proceed according to the original steps.

Original steps after the bedroom: open screen door, go east, then take a trip south, retrieve bell pepper, etc. But in the kitchen, the screen door is closed. So the next step should be to open the screen door. The user hasn't done that yet. The current room is the kitchen, and the screen door is east. So the correct action is to open the screen door.

Wait, the user was told to "open the screen door. After opening the screen door, make an effort to go to the east." So after opening the screen door, go east. But in the current room (kitchen), the screen door is closed. So first, open it. Then go east. But the user's last action was "go east" which might have been incorrect. Wait, no, the user was in the bedroom, went east into the kitchen. Now, in the kitchen, the screen door is closed. So the next step is to open the screen door. Then go east again. But the user's last action was "look", which didn't move them. So the next command should be "open screen door".

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Garden, and they tried to take the bell pepper from the floor. The game responded that they can't see any such thing. Wait, but the previous message listed a bell pepper on the floor. Maybe the command needs to be more specific. Instead of "take bell pepper from floor", maybe "take bell pepper" alone would work. Or perhaps the correct command is "take bell pepper from floor". But the game said "can't see any such thing", so maybe the bell pepper isn't visible. Wait, the description said "a bell pepper and a shovel on the floor". So it's there. Maybe the user needs to use the correct verb. In text adventures, "take" is usually the verb. So maybe "take bell pepper" without specifying the floor. Let me check the previous messages. The user tried "take bell pepper from floor", but the game didn't recognize it. Maybe the correct command is just "take bell pepper". Alternatively, maybe the bell pepper is hidden. But according to the description, it's on the floor. So the correct action is to take it. The game might have a typo or the command is case-sensitive. Let me try "take bell pepper" again.

Okay, the user is back in the Backyard after going north from the Garden. The original goal was to rest the bell pepper on the stove. So now, they need to find the stove. The previous rooms were Kitchen and Backyard. The stove is in the Kitchen. So the user needs to go back to the Kitchen, then find the stove and put the bell pepper there.

Current location is Backyard. The exits are west (screen door) and south. To get to the Kitchen, they should go west through the screen door. Then, once in the Kitchen, they can go north to the bedroom again? Wait, no. The user has the bell pepper, so they need to go back to the Kitchen where the stove is. So from Backyard, go west to Kitchen, then maybe go north to the bedroom? Wait, the Kitchen's exit north was mentioned earlier. But the user's goal is to put the bell pepper on the stove in the Kitchen. So after going west to Kitchen, they can go north to the bedroom again? Or maybe the stove is in the Kitchen. So once in the Kitchen, they can go to the stove and put the bell pepper there.

But the user is in the Backyard. The next step is to go west to the Kitchen. Then, in the Kitchen, they can go north to the bedroom again? Or maybe the stove is in the Kitchen. So the correct path is: Backyard → Kitchen (west) → then go north to the bedroom? Wait, no. The user needs to get to the stove in the Kitchen. So after going west to the Kitchen, they can go north to the bedroom, but that's not helpful. Wait, maybe the stove is in the Kitchen. So once in the Kitchen, they can go to the stove and put the bell pepper there. So the next action is to go west to the Kitchen, then go to the stove. But the current command is to go west from Backyard to Kitchen. So the next command should be "go west".
