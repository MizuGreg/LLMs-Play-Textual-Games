Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, you could, like, ensure that the chest drawer inside the bedroom is open. After that, take the old key from the chest drawer inside the bedroom. After picking up the old key, unlock the wooden door. If you have unlocked the wooden door, doublecheck that the wooden door is opened. And then, head east. After that, attempt to travel south. Then, retrieve the apple from the couch within the living room. And then, take a trip north. After that, place the apple on the stove within the kitchen. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Bedroom =-
Look around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a bedroom.

You can see a chest drawer. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You make out a closed antique trunk. You can make out a king-size bed. Now why would someone leave that there? The king-size bed is ordinary. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens, here in TextWorld!

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user has already opened the chest drawer and taken the old key. The next step was to unlock the wooden door. So, after taking the key, the next action should be to unlock the door. But wait, in TextWorld, you usually need to use the key to unlock something. So maybe the command is "unlock wooden door" or "use old key on wooden door". But the game might expect a specific command. Let me check the previous steps. The user was told to "unlock the wooden door" after taking the key. So the correct command here would be "unlock wooden door". Let me make sure that's the right action. Yes, that's the next step. So the next action is to unlock the door.

Okay, let's see. The user has unlocked the wooden door, but they can't see inside because the lid is in the way. The next step mentioned in the original instructions was to "doublecheck that the wooden door is opened." Since they've already unlocked it, maybe they need to check if it's fully open. But the game might require a specific command. Alternatively, maybe they need to push the lid aside to see inside. The previous action was unlocking the door, so maybe the next step is to check the door's status again. But the user's next action should be based on the current situation. The lid is blocking the view, so perhaps they need to move the lid. But the correct command here would be to "push lid" or "move lid". However, the game might have specific commands. Let me check the previous interactions. The user was told to "doublecheck that the wooden door is opened" after unlocking it. So maybe the next action is to check the door's state again. But the response after unlocking said the door is unlocked but the lid is in the way. So the next step is probably to push the lid aside to proceed. The correct command would be "push lid" or "move lid". But the game might expect "push lid" as the next action.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in the bedroom. They've unlocked the wooden door, but the lid is blocking the view. The previous attempts to push the lid didn't work. The next step according to the original instructions was to "head east" after unlocking the door. But since the lid is in the way, maybe they need to find another way to proceed. Wait, the user was told to "head east" after unlocking the door. But the door is closed because of the lid. Maybe the correct action is to try opening the door further or find a way around the lid. Alternatively, maybe the lid is part of the door, and once unlocked, it's supposed to open. But the game says the lid is in the way. Maybe the next step is to try opening the door despite the lid. Or perhaps the lid is a separate object that needs to be moved. But the user can't see inside because of the lid. The original plan was to head east after unlocking the door. So maybe the next action is to try moving east even though the door is blocked. But the game might require the lid to be moved first. However, the user tried pushing the lid and it didn't work. Maybe the correct command is "open door" or "push door". Alternatively, since the door is unlocked, maybe it's just a matter of opening it. The user might need to "open wooden door" to proceed. Let me check the previous commands. The user unlocked the door, but it's still closed because of the lid. So the next action should be to open the door. The correct command would be "open wooden door".

Okay, the user tried to "head east" but the game didn't recognize it. Maybe "go east" is the correct verb. Let me check the previous commands. The user was told to "head east" after unlocking the door. But the game might expect "go east" or "move east". Since "head east" wasn't valid, the next action should be "go east" instead.

So the correct command here is "go east".

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. A typical kind of place.

You can see a closed refrigerator, which looks usual, in the room. You can see a counter. The counter is ordinary. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You can make out a stove. The stove is standard. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You make out a kitchen island. The kitchen island is normal. On the kitchen island you make out a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

You are in a living room. An ordinary kind of place.

You can make out a couch. The couch is typical. On the couch you see an apple. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a low table. The low table is normal. On the low table you make out a remote, so there's that. You can see a tv. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a tv, go to TextWorld. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Living Room now. The goal was to retrieve the apple from the couch and then place it on the stove in the kitchen. The user has already gone south from the kitchen to the living room. Now, they need to pick up the apple from the couch. The next step would be to take the apple. So the command should be "take apple from couch" or something similar. But in TextWorld, the exact phrasing matters. The user saw the apple on the couch, so the correct command is "take apple from couch".

Okay, the user is trying to place the apple on the stove but the command isn't working. They tried "place apple on stove" and "put apple on stove", but both were rejected. Maybe the correct command is "put apple on stove" but the game expects a different phrasing. Alternatively, maybe the stove is in a different location. Wait, the user is in the Living Room, and the stove is in the Kitchen. They had to go north from the Living Room to reach the Kitchen. But in the previous step, they went north and ended up back in the Kitchen. Wait, let me check the history.

Earlier, after taking the apple from the couch, the user went north, which led them to the Kitchen. Then they tried to place the apple on the stove. But the game didn't recognize "place apple on stove" or "put apple on stove". Maybe the correct command is "put apple on stove" but the game expects the user to be in the Kitchen. Wait, when the user was in the Kitchen, they saw the stove but it was closed. So maybe they need to open the stove first? Or maybe the stove is already open. Wait, in the Kitchen description, the stove is "standard" and "unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it." So maybe the user needs to put the apple on the stove directly. But the game isn't accepting the command. Maybe the correct command is "put apple on stove" but the user is in the Living Room. Wait, no, the user went north to the Kitchen. Let me check the previous steps again.

After taking the apple from the couch, the user went north, which led them to the Kitchen. Then they tried to place the apple on the stove. The game said "That's not a verb I recognise." So maybe the correct command is "put apple on stove" but the game expects the user to be in the Kitchen. Alternatively, maybe the stove is a different object. Wait, in the Kitchen, the user saw a closed refrigerator, a counter, a stove, and a kitchen island. The stove is there. So the user is in the Kitchen, and the apple is in their inventory. The correct command should be "put apple on stove". But the game isn't recognizing it. Maybe the stove is closed, so the user needs to open it first. But the stove is standard and not described as closed. Alternatively, maybe the command should be "put apple on stove" but the game expects "put apple on the stove" with "the". But the user tried "put apple on stove" and it didn't work. Maybe the correct command is "put apple on stove" without "the". But the game is rejecting it. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use a different verb like "place" but that was also rejected. Hmm. Maybe the game expects the user to use "put" but with the correct object. Wait, the user has the apple in their inventory, so the command should be "put apple on stove". But the game says it's not a verb. Maybe the correct command is "put apple on stove" but the game is case-sensitive. Let me check the previous commands. The user wrote "put apple on stove" and it was rejected. Maybe the correct command is "put apple on stove" but the game expects "put apple on the stove". But the user tried that. Alternatively, maybe the stove is not the correct object. Wait, in the Kitchen, the user saw a stove, but maybe the correct object is "stove" or "the stove". The user is in the Kitchen, so "put apple on stove" should work. But the game is rejecting it. Maybe the user needs to use "put apple on stove" but the game is expecting "put apple on stove" without the "the". Alternatively, maybe the game is expecting a different verb. But the user has tried "put" and "place". Maybe the correct command is "put apple on stove" but the game is not recognizing it. Maybe the user needs to try a different approach. But according to the instructions, the user should only say the command. So the next action is "put apple on stove".

Since the user is in the Kitchen, maybe the correct command is "put apple on stove". But the game is rejecting it. Maybe the correct command is "put apple on stove" but the user is in the Living Room. Wait, no, the user went north to the Kitchen. Maybe the game has a bug, but the user has to follow the commands. The correct action is to put the apple on the stove in the Kitchen. So the next command should be "put apple on stove".

That's not a verb I recognise.

You can't see any such thing.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, the user is in the Living Room and tried to put the apple on the stove, but the game says "You can't see any such thing." That means the stove isn't here. Wait, the user went north from the Living Room to the Kitchen, but maybe they didn't actually move there. Let me check the previous steps. After taking the apple from the couch, the user went north, which should have led them to the Kitchen. But maybe the game's description is different. In the Kitchen, the stove is present, but the user might not be there. Alternatively, maybe the user is still in the Living Room. The command "go north" was used, but perhaps the game didn't transition correctly. The user needs to be in the Kitchen to put the apple on the stove. So the correct action is to go north again to reach the Kitchen and then put the apple on the stove. But the user is currently in the Living Room, so the next step is to go north to the Kitchen.

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. A typical kind of place.

You can see a closed refrigerator, which looks usual, in the room. You can see a counter. The counter is ordinary. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You can make out a stove. The stove is standard. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You make out a kitchen island. The kitchen island is normal. On the kitchen island you make out a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

Okay, the user is in the Kitchen and tried to "put apple on stove". The game responded with "What a good idea." which suggests that the action was successful. The next step is to check if the apple is placed on the stove. Since the user's last action was "put apple on stove" and the game didn't give an error, it's likely that the apple is now on the stove. The next step according to the original instructions was to "place the apple on the stove within the kitchen" and then "you win!". So after placing the apple, the game should end with a win. But the user is still in the Kitchen, so maybe the next action is to check if the goal is completed. However, the user needs to confirm that the apple is on the stove. Since the game didn't give an error, the correct next action is to "win" or the game might automatically end. But according to the instructions, after placing the apple on the stove, the user wins. So the final action is to "win" or the game ends. But the user has to say the command. The correct command here is "win" or the game might end. But in TextWorld, sometimes you have to use "win" or "you win". However, the user's last action was "put apple on stove", which was accepted. So the next step is to check if the game ends. But the user has to say the next command. Since the goal is achieved, the correct command is "win".
