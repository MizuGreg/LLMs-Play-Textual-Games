I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First off, ensure that the antique trunk within the bedroom is open. After that, recover the old key from the antique trunk. After that, make it so that the wooden door in the bedroom is unlocked with the old key. And then, make absolutely sure that the wooden door inside the bedroom is ajar. After opening the wooden door, go east. Then, doublecheck that the screen door is wide open. And then, attempt to travel east. And then, try to travel south. With that done, lift the milk from the floor of the garden. After stealing the milk, head north. And then, attempt to travel west. With that done, rest the milk on the stove. That's it!

-= Bedroom =-
I am sorry to announce that you are now in the bedroom. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a chest drawer. You scan the room for an antique trunk, and you find an antique trunk. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to a king-size bed. The king-size bed is standard. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. You think about smashing the king-size bed to bits, throwing the bits in the dump, etc, until you get bored.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in the TextWorld game. So far, they've opened the antique trunk, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door, and tried to make it ajar. But the system didn't recognize "ajar" as a verb, so they tried "unlock" again, which worked but maybe wasn't the right action.

The user is now asking if they're on the right track and what their next move should be. The goal is to eventually get the milk from the garden, so they need to proceed through the door. The current step is to make sure the wooden door is ajar. Since "ajar" isn't a valid command, maybe the correct action is to open the door instead. But the door is already unlocked. Alternatively, maybe "push" or "open" is the correct verb here. The user tried "unlock" again, which might not be the right action. The system's response after "ajar" was that it's not a recognized verb, so they need to use the correct command. The next step after unlocking is to open the door, so the correct command would be "open wooden door". Then, after that, go east as instructed. So the next action should be to open the door.

You can see a closed refrigerator in the room. You can make out a counter. The counter is usual. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. You scan the room, seeing a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. You can see a kitchen island. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? On the kitchen island you can see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

The bbq is usual. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm. Oh well You can see a patio table. However, the patio table, like an empty patio table, has nothing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is an open screen door leading west. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Backyard now. The task is to lift the milk from the floor of the garden. Wait, the current location is the Backyard, which is south of the Kitchen. The user needs to find the milk. In the Backyard description, there's a patio table that's empty. But the milk is supposed to be on the floor of the garden. Maybe the milk is on the patio table? Or perhaps the user needs to check the floor.

Wait, the user's next step after the Backyard is to lift the milk from the floor. But in the Backyard, the patio table is empty. The user might need to look around. The Backyard has a patio table, chairs, and a bbq. The milk could be on the floor, but the user hasn't found it yet. The previous steps involved opening doors and moving east. Now, in the Backyard, the user needs to check the floor for the milk. The command would be to look around or check the floor. But the available actions are to go west, south, etc. Maybe the milk is on the patio table, but the description says it's empty. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check the floor directly. Since the user is supposed to lift the milk from the floor, perhaps the correct action is to pick it up. But how? The user needs to find the milk first. Maybe the milk is on the floor, so the command would be to take the milk. But the user hasn't seen it yet. The previous step was moving east into the Backyard. The next action should be to look for the milk. However, the game might require the user to use the correct command. Since the user is in the Backyard, maybe the milk is on the floor, so the command is "take milk" or "pick up milk". But the user needs to first locate it. Alternatively, maybe the milk is on the patio table, but the description says it's empty. Hmm. The user's next action should be to check the floor for the milk. The correct command would be "look around" or "examine floor", but the game might expect a specific verb. Since the user's task is to lift the milk from the floor, the next step is to take the milk. So the command would be "take milk" or "lift milk". But the user needs to be in the correct location. Since the user is in the Backyard, and the milk is on the floor, the next action is to take the milk. So the answer is "take milk".

Okay, the user is in the Backyard and needs to find the milk on the floor. They've tried looking around, under the patio table, and under the chairs, but nothing. The previous commands didn't work. Maybe the milk is somewhere else. Wait, the user is in the Backyard, which is south of the Kitchen. The Kitchen had a stove, but the Backyard doesn't mention a stove. The user's task is to lift the milk from the garden's floor. Maybe the milk is on the floor directly. Since the user can't see it, perhaps they need to check the floor explicitly. The command "look at floor" might work. Alternatively, maybe the milk is on the patio table, but the description says it's empty. Wait, the user tried "look around" and "look under patio table" and "look under chairs" but didn't find anything. Maybe the correct command is "check floor" or "examine floor". But the game might require a specific verb. The user's next action should be to look at the floor. So the command would be "look at floor" or "check floor".

Okay, the user is stuck in the Backyard trying to find the milk. They've checked the patio table, chairs, and the floor multiple times but haven't found the milk. The task is to lift the milk from the floor of the garden. Maybe the milk is hidden somewhere else. Let me think about the possible locations. The Backyard has a patio table, chairs, a bbq, and a patio table. The user has checked under the patio table and chairs, but maybe the milk is on the floor but not visible. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check the south exit, which is unguarded. Wait, the Backyard has an exit to the south. Maybe the milk is outside in the garden. But the user is already in the Backyard. Alternatively, maybe the milk is on the stove in the Kitchen, but the user is in the Backyard. Wait, the user's previous steps were moving east from the Kitchen to the Backyard. Maybe the milk is in the garden area, but the user hasn't checked the south exit. The user could try going south from the Backyard. The command would be "go south". Let me check the Backyard description again. The Backyard has an unguarded exit to the south. So maybe the milk is outside, and the user needs to go south and check there. The next action should be to go south.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps to complete the game. They started in the bedroom, opened the trunk, got the key, unlocked the door, opened it, and then moved east to the kitchen. From there, they went to the backyard, found the milk, took it, and went back north to the kitchen. Then they went north again to the bathroom. Now, the task is to rest the milk on the stove. The user is in the bathroom, and the previous steps mention the kitchen having a stove. So the next logical step is to go back to the kitchen, then to the stove, and place the milk there. But the user is currently in the bathroom, so they need to go south to return to the kitchen. Once in the kitchen, they can go to the stove and put the milk down. The correct command here would be to go south from the bathroom to the kitchen, then proceed to the stove. But the user's current location is the bathroom, so the first action is to go south.

-= Kitchen =-
Of every kitchen you could have sauntered into, you had to walk into an ordinary one. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You can see a closed refrigerator in the room. You can make out a counter. The counter is usual. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. You scan the room, seeing a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. You can see a kitchen island. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? On the kitchen island you can see a note.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Okay, the user is in the Kitchen and needs to rest the milk on the stove. They tried "go to stove" but it didn't work. The available commands are looking around for the stove. The kitchen has a stove, but maybe the user needs to check the kitchen island or counter for the stove. The previous steps mention the stove is in the kitchen. Since the user can't see the stove, maybe they need to look around again or check the kitchen island. The correct command would be "look around" or "examine kitchen island" to find the stove. But the game might require a specific action. The user has the milk, so they need to place it on the stove. The next step is to find the stove and then put the milk there. The command should be "put milk on stove" once the stove is located. But since the user can't see it, they need to look. So the next action is to look around again.

The kitchen island is reliable.

On the kitchen island is a note.
