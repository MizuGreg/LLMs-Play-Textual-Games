You are now playing a life changing session of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First thing I need you to do is to assure that the chest drawer in the bedroom is open. Then, retrieve the old key from the chest drawer in the bedroom. After that, unlock the wooden door with the old key. And then, ensure that the wooden door in the bedroom is open. After that, make an attempt to move east. Following that, open the refrigerator. And then, pick up the apple from the refrigerator. After that, rest the apple on the stove. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Bedroom =-
You are in a bedroom. A normal one. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You make out a chest drawer. You can make out an antique trunk. You smell a wretched smell, and follow it to a king-size bed. The king-size bed is standard. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

-= Kitchen =-
Ah, the kitchen. This is some kind of kitchen, really great standard vibes in this place, a wonderful standard atmosphere. And now, well, you're in it.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a refrigerator. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. The counter appears to be empty. You see a stove. The stove is usual. But there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is standard. On the kitchen island you see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps in the game. They started by opening the chest drawer in the bedroom, retrieving the old key, unlocking and opening the wooden door to the east, which led them to the kitchen. Now, they need to open the refrigerator, pick up the apple from there, rest it on the stove, and then win.

In the kitchen, the user has already opened the refrigerator. The next step is to pick up the apple. The prompt mentions that the refrigerator is closed, but the user has to open it. Wait, looking back at the previous steps, after going east, the user is in the kitchen. The description says there's a refrigerator, but it's closed. The user needs to open it. However, in the latest message, the user has already opened the refrigerator, as the score increased. Wait, the user's last action was "go east", which led them to the kitchen. Then, the system message says that the refrigerator is there, but it's closed. The user's next step should be to open the refrigerator. But in the current state, the user hasn't done that yet. Wait, looking at the history: after going east, the user is in the kitchen. The system message says the refrigerator is closed. The user needs to open it. Then, after opening, pick up the apple. Then rest it on the stove.

So the next action should be to open the refrigerator. The user's current score is 5/6. The next step is to open the refrigerator. So the command should be "open refrigerator".
