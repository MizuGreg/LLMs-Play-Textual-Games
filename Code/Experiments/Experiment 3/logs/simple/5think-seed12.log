I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First off, ensure that the antique trunk within the bedroom is open. After that, recover the old key from the antique trunk. After that, make it so that the wooden door in the bedroom is unlocked with the old key. And then, make absolutely sure that the wooden door inside the bedroom is ajar. After opening the wooden door, go east. Then, doublecheck that the screen door is wide open. And then, attempt to travel east. And then, try to travel south. With that done, lift the milk from the floor of the garden. After stealing the milk, head north. And then, attempt to travel west. With that done, rest the milk on the stove. That's it!

-= Bedroom =-
I am sorry to announce that you are now in the bedroom. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a chest drawer. You scan the room for an antique trunk, and you find an antique trunk. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to a king-size bed. The king-size bed is standard. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. You think about smashing the king-size bed to bits, throwing the bits in the dump, etc, until you get bored.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in the TextWorld game. So far, they've opened the antique trunk, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door, and tried to make it ajar. But the system didn't recognize "ajar" as a verb, so they tried "unlock" again, which worked but maybe wasn't the right action.

The user is now asking if they're on the right track and what their next move should be. The goal is to eventually get the milk from the garden, so they need to proceed through the door. The current step is to make sure the wooden door is ajar. Since "ajar" isn't a valid command, maybe the correct action is to open the door instead. But the door is already unlocked. Alternatively, maybe "push" or "open" is the correct verb here. The user tried "unlock" again, which might not be the right action. The system's response after "ajar" was that it's not a recognized verb, so they need to use the correct command. The next step after unlocking is to open the door, so the correct command would be "open wooden door". Then, after that, go east as instructed. So the next action should be to open the door.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text adventure game and has followed a series of steps to open doors and move around. The current location is the Backyard. The task was to lift the milk from the floor of the garden, then head north, then west, and rest the milk on the stove.

Wait, the user is in the Backyard. The original goal mentioned lifting milk from the garden's floor. But in the Backyard description, there's no mention of milk. The user might have missed something. Let me check the previous steps again.

Earlier, in the Kitchen, there's a note on the kitchen island. Maybe the milk is there? But the user hasn't checked the kitchen island yet. Wait, the user just went east from the Kitchen to the Backyard. The Kitchen had a note, but the user hasn't looked at it. Maybe the note has information about the milk?

Alternatively, maybe the milk is in the garden area. But the Backyard is part of the garden. However, the Backyard description doesn't mention milk. The user needs to find the milk. Maybe the milk is on the floor of the garden, which is the Backyard. But how to pick it up?

The user's next step should be to check the kitchen island for the note, maybe the note tells where the milk is. Alternatively, maybe the milk is in the garden, and the user needs to look around. But the Backyard description doesn't mention milk. Maybe the user needs to check the kitchen again.

Wait, the user's last action was going east to the Backyard. The next step is to find the milk. Since the Backyard doesn't mention milk, maybe the milk is in the Kitchen. But the user hasn't checked the kitchen island's note yet. The note might have a clue. So the user should go back to the Kitchen, check the note, and then find the milk.

But according to the original task, after opening the door to the backyard, the user should "lift the milk from the floor of the garden." So maybe the milk is in the Backyard. But the description doesn't mention it. Maybe the user needs to look more carefully. Alternatively, maybe the milk is in the garden area, and the user needs to pick it up from the floor.

But the user is in the Backyard. The Backyard's description says there's a set of chairs, a bbq, a patio table, but nothing on them. The user needs to find the milk. Maybe the milk is on the floor. So the next action is to pick it up. But how? The user needs to "lift the milk from the floor." So the command would be "take milk" or "lift milk."

But the user hasn't found the milk yet. The previous steps didn't mention it. Maybe the milk is in the garden, and the user needs to look around. Since the Backyard is the garden, the user should check the floor. So the next action is to lift the milk. But the user hasn't found it yet. Maybe the milk is on the floor, so the user should try to take it.

Alternatively, maybe the milk is in the kitchen. But the user is in the Backyard. So the correct next step is to go back to the Kitchen, check the note, and then find the milk. But the user's next action is to lift the milk from the garden's floor. So the user should look for the milk in the Backyard. If it's not there, maybe the user made a mistake in the previous steps.

But according to the game's current state, the user is in the Backyard. The next step is to lift the milk. So the user should try to take the milk from the floor. The command would be "take milk" or "lift milk." But the game might require the exact command. Since the user's task says "lift the milk from the floor of the garden," the correct action is to lift it. So the next command is "lift milk."

Okay, let's see. The user needs to lift the milk from the floor of the garden. Earlier attempts to pick it up failed. Now, in the Garden scene, the milk is on the floor. The correct action would be to pick it up. The user tried "lift milk from floor" which wasn't recognized, then "pick up milk from floor" which also didn't work. Now, the user is in the Garden, and the milk is listed as being on the floor. The next step is to use the correct verb. The available verbs here are "pick up" or "take". Since the game says "You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north." but the milk is on the floor, the correct action is to pick up the milk. The user should try "pick up milk" without specifying "from floor" since the game might automatically recognize it's on the floor. So the next command is "pick up milk".

Okay, let's see. The user has been following a series of steps in this text-based game. Their goal was to open the antique trunk, get the key, unlock the door, make sure it's ajar, then go east, check the screen door, proceed east again, then go south, pick up the milk, head north, and rest the milk on the stove.

So far, they've managed to get the milk from the garden, go back through the backyard, kitchen, and even the bathroom. Now they're back in the kitchen. The next step according to the original plan was to rest the milk on the stove. But in the current location, the stove is described as being empty. The user has the milk in their inventory, so the next logical step would be to place it on the stove. The command should be "put milk on stove" or something similar. Since the game's previous actions involved using verbs like "pick up" and "open", the correct command here would be to put the milk on the stove. The user is in the kitchen, which has a stove, so that's the right place. They need to execute that action to complete the task.
