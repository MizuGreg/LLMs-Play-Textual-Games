I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, open the antique trunk. And then, retrieve the old key from the antique trunk. With the old key, unlock the wooden door inside the bedroom with the old key. Then, ensure that the wooden door is open. And then, head east. After that, ensure that the screen door is open. And then, head east. And then, try to move south. And then, pick-up the bell pepper from the floor of the garden. With the bell pepper, attempt to head north. With that accomplished, go to the west. And then, place the bell pepper on the stove. Alright, thanks!

-= Bedroom =-
Ah, the bedroom. This is some kind of bedroom, really great normal vibes in this place, a wonderful normal atmosphere. You can barely contain your excitement.

You can make out a closed chest drawer in the room. You can see a closed antique trunk nearby. You make out a king-size bed. The king-size bed is normal. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

You are in a kitchen. It seems to be pretty usual here.

Were you looking for a refrigerator? Because look over there, it's a refrigerator. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. The counter appears to be empty. You scan the room, seeing a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is typical. On the kitchen island you make out a note. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game and has completed several steps. They've opened an antique trunk, retrieved a key, unlocked a door, opened another door, moved east, opened a screen door, and now are in a garden. The next steps mentioned in the original task were to pick up the bell pepper, use it to go north, then go west and place the bell pepper on the stove.

Currently, the user is in the Garden, and the next action was to pick up the bell pepper. The user tried that but the system responded that it was only understood up to wanting to pick it up. Then the user is asked if they think they're on the right track and to say the next command.

So, the next step after picking up the bell pepper is to use it to go north. The user needs to attempt to move north with the bell pepper. The correct command would be "go north" but with the bell pepper. However, in the game's context, the command might just be "go north" since the action of using the bell pepper might be implied. But the previous steps showed that after picking up the bell pepper, the next step was to "attempt to head north" with it. So the command should be "go north".

But the user's last action was "pick up the bell pepper from the floor", which the system didn't fully process. The user is now asking if they're on the right track. The answer is yes, they're following the correct steps. The next action is to go north with the bell pepper. So the correct command is "go north".

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's break down the user's situation. They've been moving between rooms in a text-based game, following a specific set of tasks. The main goal is to eventually reach the original goal, which isn't explicitly stated here, but based on the initial instructions, it might involve completing certain actions like picking up items, opening doors, and placing objects.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Garden, and the next step was to go north with the bell pepper. However, every time they try to go north, they end up back in the Backyard, and the screen door is still closed. The user has been stuck in a loop between the Garden and Backyard, trying to go north but getting redirected south instead. 

The user's previous actions included picking up the bell pepper, attempting to go north, but the game's responses indicate that the movement is restricted. The key here is that the user might need to place the bell pepper on the stove as part of the task. The original instructions mentioned placing the bell pepper on the stove after going west. However, the user hasn't done that yet.

Wait, the user's last action was "go north," which led them back to the Backyard. The Garden's description mentions a stove, but in the current state, the user is in the Backyard. The stove might be in the Kitchen or another room. The user needs to navigate back to the Kitchen, perhaps through the west door, then find the stove and place the bell pepper there.

But the user's current position is the Backyard, and the only exit mentioned is south to the Garden. The user might be missing a step where they need to go west from the Backyard to the Kitchen, then proceed to the stove. However, the user's last action was going south, which brings them back to the Garden. It seems like they're not progressing correctly.

The user might need to check if they have the bell pepper, which they do, and then find the stove. The stove is in the Kitchen, so they need to go west from the Backyard through the screen door to the Kitchen. Then, once in the Kitchen, they can place the bell pepper on the stove. But the user hasn't tried that yet. However, the current state shows they're in the Backyard, so the next step should be to go west through the screen door to the Kitchen, then proceed to the stove.

But the user's last action was "go south," which is leading them back to the Garden. The user might be stuck in a loop because they're not moving west. The correct next step would be to go west from the Backyard to the Kitchen, then find the stove and place the bell pepper there. However, the user hasn't done that yet. So the next command should be "go west" from the Backyard to reach the Kitchen, then "place the bell pepper on the stove."

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out what's going on here. The user is in the Garden, and they've been trying to go west, but the game says they can't. The original task was to place the bell pepper on the stove. The user has the bell pepper, so maybe they need to go to the Kitchen where the stove is. But how?

Looking at the previous rooms, when the user was in the Kitchen, there was a screen door leading east and an open wooden door west. The Backyard has an open screen door west. Wait, maybe the user is in the Garden, and the stove is in the Kitchen. To get there, they need to go west through the screen door from the Backyard. But the user tried going west and got "You can't go that way." Maybe the screen door is closed? But earlier, the user opened the screen door in the Kitchen. Wait, the user was in the Backyard, and the screen door leading west is open. So why can't they go west?

Wait, maybe the user is in the Garden, and the screen door is in the Backyard. So from the Garden, going south leads back to the Garden, but the user needs to go west from the Backyard. But the user is in the Garden, so maybe they need to go south to the Garden again? No, that doesn't make sense. Maybe there's a mistake in the game's navigation. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go to the Kitchen through the screen door, but the screen door is closed. But earlier, the user opened the screen door in the Kitchen. Wait, the user was in the Kitchen and opened the screen door leading east, which connects to the Backyard. So from the Backyard, going west would lead back to the Kitchen. But the user is in the Garden, so maybe they need to go south to the Garden again? No, that's not helpful.

Wait, the user is in the Garden, and the only exit mentioned is north. But the user tried going north and ended up in the Backyard. So maybe the correct path is to go west from the Backyard to the Kitchen, but the user can't because the screen door is closed. But earlier, the user opened the screen door in the Kitchen. Maybe the user needs to go west from the Backyard, but the screen door is closed. But the description says the screen door is open. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the user is stuck because they need to place the bell pepper on the stove, which is in the Kitchen. So the user needs to go to the Kitchen, but the path is blocked. The user has the bell pepper, so maybe they need to go to the Kitchen, find the stove, and place it there. But how to get there?

Wait, the user is in the Garden. The only way to the Kitchen is through the Backyard's screen door. So from the Garden, go south to the Backyard, then west through the screen door to the Kitchen. But the user is in the Garden, so they need to go south to the Backyard, then west. But the user's last action was going west from the Garden, which isn't possible. So maybe the user needs to go south first to the Backyard, then west. But the user is in the Garden, so the next step is to go south, then west. But the user tried going west from the Garden and got "You can't go that way." So maybe the user needs to go south to the Backyard first, then west. But the user is in the Garden, so the correct command is "go south" to reach the Backyard, then "go west" to the Kitchen. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action should be "go south" to the Backyard, then "go west" to the Kitchen. But the user is in the Garden, so the first step is "go south".
