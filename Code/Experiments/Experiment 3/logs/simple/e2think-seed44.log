Welcome to TextWorld! Here is how to play! First thing I need you to do is to doublecheck that the antique trunk is opened. Then, recover the old key from the antique trunk inside the bedroom. Having taken the old key, insert the old key into the wooden door inside the bedroom's lock to unlock it. After that, look and see that the wooden door is ajar. And then, travel east. With that over with, ensure that the screen door is open. And then, attempt to move east. After that, make an attempt to go south. With that accomplished, lift the apple from the floor of the garden. After that, make an attempt to take a trip north. Then, go to the west. With that over with, put the apple on the stove. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Bedroom =-
You find yourself in a bedroom. An ordinary one.

Oh, great. Here's a chest drawer. You make out an antique trunk. Huh, weird. You make out a king-size bed. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game called TextWorld. The goal seems to be a series of specific actions they need to follow. Let me recap the steps they've taken so far.

First, they were in the bedroom and found an antique trunk. They opened it and took an old key. The score increased each time they completed a step. The next step in the initial instructions was to insert the old key into the wooden door's lock to unlock it. Then, after unlocking, they needed to check if the door is ajar, move east, ensure the screen door is open, move east again, try to go south, pick up an apple from the garden, take a trip north, go west, put the apple on the stove, and then stop.

So far, the user has completed the first two steps: opening the trunk and taking the key. The next step according to the instructions is to insert the key into the wooden door's lock. The current location is the bedroom, and there's a closed wooden door leading east. The user needs to use the old key to unlock it. 

The user's next action should be to use the key on the door. The command would be "use old key on wooden door" or something similar. But in the game's context, the correct command might be "unlock wooden door with old key" or "insert old key into wooden door". However, based on the previous commands the user used ("open antique trunk", "take old key from antique trunk"), the next logical step is to use the key on the door. 

The user's previous actions were "open antique trunk" and "take old key from antique trunk". The next step is to insert the key into the door's lock. The correct command here would be "use old key on wooden door" or "unlock wooden door with old key". But since the game might expect a specific syntax, maybe "insert old key into wooden door". However, the user's previous commands were more about interacting with objects directly. 

Looking at the initial instructions: "insert the old key into the wooden door inside the bedroom's lock to unlock it." So the action is to insert the key into the door's lock. The correct command here would be "insert old key into wooden door". But the user might need to first approach the door. However, in the current location, the wooden door is already present. So the next step is to insert the key into the door's lock. 

Therefore, the next action should be "insert old key into wooden door".

Okay, let's see. The user is in the bedroom, has the old key, and just unlocked the wooden door leading east. The next step according to the original instructions was to check if the door is ajar, then move east, ensure the screen door is open, move east again, try to go south, pick up an apple, etc.

So after unlocking the door, the next logical step is to open the door. The user needs to make sure the door is ajar. The command would be "open wooden door" or "push wooden door". But since the door was just unlocked, maybe it's already open. However, the instruction says "look and see that the wooden door is ajar", so maybe the user needs to check it. But the game might require an action to open it. Alternatively, the door might be unlocked but not open, so the user needs to push it open.

The previous action was "unlock wooden door with old key", and the response was "You unlock wooden door." So the door is now unlocked. The next step is to open it. The correct command here would be "open wooden door" or "push wooden door east". Since the door is leading east, maybe "push wooden door east" to open it. But the user needs to first check if it's ajar. However, the game might require the user to open it. So the next action should be "open wooden door".

Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You make out a stove. The stove appears to be empty. Sometimes, just sometimes, TextWorld can just be the worst. You can see a kitchen island. On the kitchen island you can see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

The next steps according to the original instructions were to ensure the screen door is open, then move east again, attempt to go south, pick up the apple from the garden, etc.

In the kitchen, there's a closed screen door leading east. The user needs to make sure that screen door is open. The instruction says "ensure that the screen door is open" before moving east.

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a set of chairs. The set of chairs is usual. But the thing is empty.

Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The patio table is typical. The patio table appears to be empty.

There is an open screen door leading west. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

Okay, the user is in the backyard now. The previous steps were opening the screen door and moving east to the backyard. The next step according to the original instructions was to "attempt to move east" after ensuring the screen door is open. But the user is already in the backyard. Wait, maybe the next step is to check the south exit as mentioned in the environment description. The instruction said after moving east, attempt to go south. So the user needs to try moving south from the backyard. The command would be "go south".

Okay, the user is in the garden and tried to take the apple from the floor, but the game said they can't see any such thing. Let me check the environment description again. The garden has a tomato plant, milk, an apple, and a shovel on the floor. Wait, maybe the apple is not visible because it's covered by something else. The user might need to look closer or check under a object. Alternatively, maybe the command should be "take apple" without specifying the floor. Let me think. The previous command was "take apple from floor", but the game responded that it can't see the apple. Maybe the apple is actually present but not on the floor. Wait, the description says "an apple and a shovel on the floor". So the apple is on the floor. Maybe the correct command is "take apple" instead of specifying the floor. Let me try that. The user needs to take the apple from the floor, but the game might require just "take apple" without the "from floor" part. So the next action should be "take apple".

Okay, the user is in the living room now. The previous steps involved moving west from the backyard to the kitchen, then south to the living room. The original goal was to eventually put the apple on the stove. The user has the apple from the garden. Now, they need to find the stove, which is in the kitchen.
