You are now playing a life changing round of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First off, make absolutely sure that the antique trunk is ajar. Then, retrieve the old key from the antique trunk. And then, make absolutely sure that the wooden door in the bedroom is unlocked. And then, look and see that the wooden door is open. And then, make an attempt to head east. And then, open the refrigerator inside the kitchen. If you have opened the refrigerator, pick up the lettuce from the refrigerator. And then, sit the lettuce on the stove inside the kitchen. Alright, thanks!

-= Bedroom =-
You are in a bedroom. A normal kind of place. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You can see a chest drawer. You can see a closed antique trunk, which looks usual, right there by you. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a king-size bed. The king-size bed is normal. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

<think>
Okay, let me figure out what to do next. The user has been following the steps given in the initial instructions. Let me recap the current state.

First, they needed to make sure the antique trunk is ajar. They opened it and found the old key. Then they had to retrieve the key, which they did. Next, they needed to unlock the wooden door in the bedroom with the old key. But earlier, when they tried to open the door, they were told they needed to unlock it first. So, the next logical step is to use the old key to unlock the wooden door.

Wait, the user tried to go east but was told to open the door first. Then they tried to open the door but were told to use the key. So after getting the key, the next action should be to unlock the door. Let me check the previous steps again.

The user just retrieved the old key from the trunk. The next step according to the initial instructions was to make sure the wooden door is unlocked. So the correct action here is to unlock the door with the key. The user hasn't done that yet. So the next command should be "unlock wooden door" or "use old key on wooden door". But the game might expect a specific command. Let me check the previous interactions.

In the history, when the user tried to open the door, the game said they needed to unlock it with the key. So the correct action now is to unlock the door. The command would be "unlock wooden door". But maybe the game expects "use old key on wooden door". However, the user's previous action was "get old key from antique trunk", and now they have the key. So the next step is to use the key to unlock the door. The correct command here is "unlock wooden door" or "use old key on wooden door". But looking at the game's responses, when the user tried to open the door, the game said they needed to unlock it. So the next action should be to unlock the door. Therefore, the correct command is "unlock wooden door".

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. An ordinary one.

You make out a refrigerator, so there's that. What's that over there? It looks like it's a counter. The counter is normal. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What's the point of an empty counter? You can see a stove. The stove is normal. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You make out a kitchen island. On the kitchen island you see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Okay, let's see. The user has followed the steps correctly so far. They opened the antique trunk, got the key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, went east to the kitchen. Now they opened the refrigerator, took the lettuce. The next step according to the original instructions was to sit the lettuce on the stove.

So the current location is the kitchen, and the user has the lettuce. The next action should be to go to the stove and place the lettuce there. But first, they need to check if the stove is accessible. The description mentions a stove in the kitchen, so the command would be to "put lettuce on stove". But maybe the correct command is "sit lettuce on stove" as per the instructions. The user's previous action was "take lettuce from refrigerator", so now they need to move to the stove and place it. The game might require the exact command "put lettuce on stove" or "sit lettuce on stove". Since the original instruction said "sit the lettuce on the stove", the correct command here is "sit lettuce on stove".
