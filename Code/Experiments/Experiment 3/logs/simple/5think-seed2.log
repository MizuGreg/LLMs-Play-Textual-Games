You are now playing a exciting game of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First stop, assure that the chest drawer in the bedroom is wide open. And then, pick up the old key from the chest drawer inside the bedroom. Then, check that the wooden door is unlocked with the old key. After unlocking the wooden door, assure that the wooden door is wide open. After that, head east. Then, ensure that the screen door in the kitchen is open. Then, make an attempt to move east. With that accomplished, make an attempt to head south. Then, pick-up the lettuce from the floor of the garden. Then, travel north. Then, try to take a trip west. Then, rest the lettuce on the stove inside the kitchen. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Bedroom =-
You arrive in a bedroom. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You make out a chest drawer. What's that over there? It looks like it's an antique trunk. Were you looking for a king-size bed? Because look over there, it's a king-size bed. The king-size bed is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

You arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.

You see a closed refrigerator. What's that over there? It looks like it's a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is ordinary. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. What's the point of an empty counter? You can see a stove. The stove is usual. The stove appears to be empty. You see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is standard. On the kitchen island you make out a note. Hmmm... what else, what else?

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

Okay, let me go through the steps again to make sure I'm on track. The user has already completed the tasks in the bedroom: opened the chest drawer, picked up the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, then went east into the kitchen. The next steps according to the original task were to ensure the screen door in the kitchen is open, then try to move east, then south, pick up the lettuce in the garden, travel north, west, rest the lettuce on the stove, and finally stop.

In the kitchen, the user now sees a closed screen door leading east and an open wooden door west. The next step mentioned was to ensure the screen door is open. So the next action should be to open the screen door. But wait, the user's last action was going east, which led them to the kitchen. Wait, no—the user was in the bedroom, opened the door, went east into the kitchen. Now, in the kitchen, the screen door is closed. The next task is to check the screen door in the kitchen is open. So the correct next step is to open the screen door. But the user's last action was "go east", which led them into the kitchen. Now, in the kitchen, the screen door is closed. So the next action should be to open the screen door. But the user's current location is the kitchen. So the next command should be "open screen door". But the game's response after going east into the kitchen says that the screen door is closed. So the user needs to open it. Then, after that, the next step is to attempt to move east again. But the user's next action should be to open the screen door. However, the user's previous action was "go east", which brought them into the kitchen. Now, in the kitchen, the screen door is closed. So the next step is to open it. Therefore, the next command should be "open screen door".

You're now in the backyard. You begin looking for stuff.

You make out a set of chairs. The set of chairs is ordinary. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? Oh, great. Here's a bbq. The bbq appears to be empty. Hm. Oh well Look over there! a patio table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the patio table.

There is an open screen door leading west. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

Okay, let's see. The user has been through several rooms: bedroom, kitchen, backyard, and now back in the backyard again. Their goal was to pick up the lettuce in the garden and then rest it on the stove in the kitchen. So far, they've picked up the lettuce in the garden (step 9/10) and then went back to the backyard (step 9/11). Now, the next logical step would be to head back to the kitchen to rest the lettuce on the stove.

But wait, the user is in the backyard again. The previous steps mention that after picking up the lettuce, they went north to the backyard. Now, they need to get back to the kitchen. The kitchen was previously accessed via the eastern door from the bedroom, but now they're in the backyard. The backyard has a screen door leading west, which might connect back to the kitchen. However, the kitchen's screen door was opened earlier, so maybe they can go west from the backyard through the screen door to get back to the kitchen. Once there, they can rest the lettuce on the stove. So the next action should be to go west from the backyard to return to the kitchen and then place the lettuce on the stove. But the current location is the backyard, so the immediate action is to go west through the screen door. Then, once in the kitchen, they can rest the lettuce. But the user's last action was "go north" which brought them back to the backyard. So the next command should be "go west" to return to the kitchen. Then, once in the kitchen, they can "rest lettuce on stove". But the user's current location is the backyard, so the next step is to go west. The user's last input was "go north", leading to the backyard. Now, the correct next step is to go west to return to the kitchen. Therefore, the answer should be "go west".

Okay, let's see. The user has been following a series of steps in the TextWorld game. Their goal was to complete a list of tasks, starting from the bedroom, then moving through the kitchen, backyard, garden, and so on. So far, they've picked up the lettuce in the garden and need to rest it on the stove in the kitchen.

Looking at the current state, the user is back in the kitchen again after moving between rooms. The next step according to the original task was to "rest the lettuce on the stove inside the kitchen." The user has the lettuce in their inventory, as they picked it up earlier. Now, they need to place it on the stove.

But wait, the stove is described as "usual" and "appears to be empty." The user needs to interact with the stove to place the lettuce there. The previous actions involved moving between rooms and opening doors, but now the focus should be on the kitchen's stove. The user is in the kitchen, so the next logical step is to try and put the lettuce on the stove. The command should be "put lettuce on stove" or something similar. However, the game's commands might require a specific phrasing. Since the user has the lettuce, they need to use the correct verb to place it. The correct command here would be "put lettuce on stove".
