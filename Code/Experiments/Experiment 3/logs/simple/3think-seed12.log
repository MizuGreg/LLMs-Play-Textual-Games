I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First off, ensure that the antique trunk within the bedroom is open. After that, recover the old key from the antique trunk. After that, make it so that the wooden door in the bedroom is unlocked with the old key. And then, make absolutely sure that the wooden door inside the bedroom is ajar. After opening the wooden door, go east. Then, doublecheck that the screen door is wide open. And then, attempt to travel east. And then, try to travel south. With that done, lift the milk from the floor of the garden. After stealing the milk, head north. And then, attempt to travel west. With that done, rest the milk on the stove. That's it!

-= Bedroom =-
I am sorry to announce that you are now in the bedroom. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a chest drawer. You scan the room for an antique trunk, and you find an antique trunk. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to a king-size bed. The king-size bed is standard. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. You think about smashing the king-size bed to bits, throwing the bits in the dump, etc, until you get bored.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me see. The user has been following the steps in the TextWorld game. They started by opening the antique trunk, taking the old key, unlocking the wooden door, and now they've made it to the fourth step. The next step according to the original task was to make sure the wooden door is ajar. Since they just unlocked it, maybe that's done. Then they need to go east.

Wait, the user's last action was unlocking the wooden door, and the next step in the task was to make sure the door is ajar. Since unlocking usually means it's open, maybe that's done. Then the next step is to go east. The user has to go east from the bedroom. So the next command should be "go east". But I need to check the current room. The previous message shows that after unlocking the door, the next step is to go east. So the correct action here is to go east. The user should input "go east" now.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in the TextWorld game. So far, they've opened the antique trunk, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door, and opened it. Now they need to double-check that the screen door is wide open. But the system said "That's not a verb I recognise." So maybe "doublecheck screen door is wide open" isn't the correct command.

Hmm, in TextWorld, commands are usually verbs. So instead of "doublecheck," maybe they need to use "check" or "ensure." Also, the screen door might be referred to as a different name. Let me think. The user mentioned "screen door," but maybe the game calls it something else like "screen door" or "door." Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "open screen door" to ensure it's wide open.

Wait, the user's next step after opening the wooden door is to double-check the screen door is wide open. But the system didn't recognize "doublecheck." So perhaps the correct command is "check screen door" or "open screen door." Since the goal is to make sure it's wide open, maybe "open screen door" is the right action. Alternatively, if it's already open, maybe "check" would work. But the user might need to use the correct verb here. Let me check the previous commands. The user used "unlock" and "open," so maybe "open" is the right verb here. So the next command should be "open screen door." But the user might have to use "check" instead. Alternatively, maybe the screen door is already open, and the user just needs to confirm. But the system's response was that "doublecheck" isn't a valid verb. So the correct command is likely "check screen door" or "open screen door." Since the user's next action is to double-check, maybe "check screen door" is the right command. But I need to make sure. Let me think again. The user's instruction says "doublecheck that the screen door is wide open." So the correct command would be "check screen door" or "open screen door." Since the system didn't accept "doublecheck," the user should use "check" instead. So the next action is "check screen door." But maybe the game expects "open" if it's not already open. However, the user's goal is to make sure it's wide open, so perhaps "open screen door" is the correct command. Alternatively, if it's already open, "check" would confirm. But since the user is following the steps, maybe "open screen door" is the right move here. Let me go with "open screen door" as the next command.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this TextWorld game and has followed a set of instructions. Let me recap the steps they've taken so far to make sure I understand where they are.

Starting in the bedroom, they opened the antique trunk, took the old key, unlocked the wooden door, and then opened it. They went east into the kitchen, then north to the bathroom. Now, the next step according to the original task was after opening the wooden door (which they did), to double-check the screen door is wide open. But when they tried to double-check, the game said "That's not a verb I recognise." Then they tried to open the screen door, but the game said they can't see any such thing. Then they went east again, which led them to the kitchen. Then they went north to the bathroom.

Wait, the original task said after opening the wooden door (in the bedroom), they should double-check the screen door is wide open. But in the kitchen, there's a screen door leading east. But when they tried to open it, the game didn't recognize the command. Maybe the screen door is already open? Or maybe the correct action is to check if it's open. But the user tried "doublecheck screen door is wide open" which wasn't a valid command. Then they tried "open screen door" but the game said they can't see it. So maybe the screen door isn't there, or they need a different approach.

But in the kitchen, the user is now in the bathroom. The original task after the bedroom steps was to go east from the opened wooden door, then double-check the screen door is wide open, then travel east and south. But perhaps the screen door is in the kitchen. Let me check the previous steps again.

After opening the wooden door (bedroom), the user went east into the kitchen. In the kitchen, there's a closed screen door leading east. So maybe the user needs to open that screen door. But when they tried to open it, the game didn't recognize the command. Wait, the user tried "open screen door" but the game said they can't see any such thing. Maybe the screen door is not in the kitchen? Or maybe the correct command is to open the screen door, but the game doesn't allow that. Alternatively, maybe the screen door is already open, and the user needs to check if it's open. But the user tried to "doublecheck screen door is wide open" which wasn't a valid command.

Alternatively, maybe the screen door is in the kitchen, and the user needs to open it. But the game's response said they can't see any such thing. Wait, in the kitchen description, there's a closed refrigerator, a counter, a stove, a kitchen island with a note, a closed screen door leading east, and an open wooden door leading west. So the screen door is there, but closed. So the user needs to open it. But when they tried "open screen door", the game didn't recognize it. Maybe the correct command is "open the screen door" with "the" included. But the user might not have included "the" in their command. However, in the previous steps, the user used commands like "open antique trunk" without "the", so maybe the game expects "open screen door" without "the". But the game said they can't see any such thing. Hmm, maybe the screen door is not there, or the user is in the wrong location.

Wait, the user is in the bathroom now. They came from the kitchen by going north. So the screen door is in the kitchen, leading east. So the user needs to go back to the kitchen, open the screen door, then proceed east. But the user is in the bathroom. So the next step would be to go south back to the kitchen, then open the screen door. But according to the original task, after opening the wooden door (bedroom), they should go east (to kitchen), double-check screen door is open, then go east again, then south. But the user is now in the bathroom, so they need to go back to the kitchen.

So the correct next action would be to go south from the bathroom back to the kitchen. Then, in the kitchen, open the screen door. Then go east. Then go south. Then lift the milk from the garden, etc. But the user is currently in the bathroom. So the next step is to go south to the kitchen. Then open the screen door. Then proceed east. Then go south. But the user's current location is the bathroom, so the next command should be "go south" to return to the kitchen.

Okay, let me try to figure out what the user needs to do next. The original task was a series of steps in TextWorld. Let me recap the steps to make sure I don't miss anything.

First, they had to open the antique trunk in the bedroom, take the old key, unlock the wooden door, and make sure it's ajar. Then go east, check the screen door is open, travel east and south. Then go to the garden, lift the milk, head north, go west, and put the milk on the stove.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the kitchen again. The previous steps had them moving between rooms, but they haven't reached the garden yet. The next steps after the kitchen were supposed to be going east from the bedroom, but there was some confusion with the screen door. Now, after moving back to the kitchen, the user needs to continue with the remaining tasks.

Wait, the user mentioned lifting the milk from the floor of the garden. So they need to get to the garden. The current location is the kitchen. The kitchen has a screen door leading east and an open wooden door west. The exit to the south is unguarded. But the garden is probably east of the kitchen, since the screen door is there. So maybe the next step is to go east through the screen door to reach the garden.

But the user's last action was going south from the bathroom back to the kitchen. Now, they need to proceed east from the kitchen through the screen door. However, the screen door is closed. So the user needs to open it first. But in the kitchen description, the screen door is listed as closed. So the next action should be to open the screen door.

Wait, but the original task said after opening the wooden door in the bedroom, go east. Then double-check the screen door is wide open. But in the kitchen, the screen door is closed. So maybe the user needs to open it. However, the user might have already done that. Wait, no, in the previous steps, when they tried to go east from the bedroom, the screen door wasn't open. Then they went to the kitchen, and now the screen door is closed. So the user needs to open it before proceeding.

But the user's next action should be to open the screen door. However, the user is currently in the kitchen. So the correct next step is to open the screen door leading east. Then, after that, go east to the garden. Then lift the milk from the floor. Then head north, go west, and put the milk on the stove.

But the user's current location is the kitchen. The screen door is closed, so they need to open it. Therefore, the next command should be "open screen door".

Okay, let's see. The user's task is to lift the milk from the floor of the garden. They just arrived in the Garden room, and the description mentions that there's a milk on the floor. So the next logical step is to pick up the milk.

The user's previous action was going south into the Garden. Now, they need to take the milk. The command should be "take milk". That's the direct action needed here. Let me make sure there's no other step required. The original goal also mentions stealing the milk, so "take" is appropriate. No other objects are mentioned as needing attention here. So the correct command is "take milk".

Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is an open screen door leading west. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

-= Kitchen =-
Of every kitchen you could have sauntered into, you had to walk into an ordinary one. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You can see a closed refrigerator in the room. You can make out a counter. The counter is usual. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. You scan the room, seeing a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. You can see a kitchen island. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? On the kitchen island you can see a note.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps in the game, moving through different rooms and interacting with objects. The current goal is to rest the milk on the stove after stealing it from the garden. The user just came back to the kitchen after going west from the backyard.

In the kitchen, the user has already opened the screen door east and the wooden door west. The next step according to the original task was to rest the milk on the stove. The user has the milk in hand, so the next action should be to go to the stove and place the milk there. But wait, the stove is described as being empty. So the user needs to go to the stove, then put the milk on it. 

Looking at the current room (Kitchen), the user can see a stove, but there's nothing on it. The user is holding the milk. So the correct sequence is to go to the stove, then rest the milk there. The command would be "rest milk on stove" or "put milk on stove". However, in the game's context, the exact phrasing might matter. The user has to use the correct verb. Since the previous action was "take milk", the next step is to place it on the stove. The correct command here is "rest milk on stove" or "put milk on stove". But the game might expect "rest" as the verb. Let me check the previous interactions. The user was told to "rest the milk on the stove" in the original task. So the correct command is "rest milk on stove".

That's not a verb I recognise.

Okay, the user is trying to rest the milk on the stove, but the system is rejecting "rest" as a verb. Let me think about the possible correct command. In TextWorld games, actions are usually verbs that match the available objects and actions. The user has the milk in hand, and the stove is an object in the kitchen.

The correct action here would be to place the milk on the stove. The verb "put" is commonly used for such actions. So instead of "rest," the correct command should be "put milk on stove." Let me check if that's the right syntax. Yes, "put" is the correct verb here. The user might have used "rest" by mistake, thinking it's a valid verb for placing items. So the next action should be "put milk on stove."
