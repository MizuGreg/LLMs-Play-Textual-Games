Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First step, assure that the chest drawer within the bedroom is opened. And then, retrieve the old key from the chest drawer. After that, make absolutely sure that the wooden door in the bedroom is unlocked with the old key. After that, open the wooden door inside the bedroom. After that, attempt to travel east. Following that, ensure that the refrigerator in the kitchen is open. And then, take the lettuce from the refrigerator inside the kitchen. And then, rest the lettuce on the stove. Alright, thanks!

-= Bedroom =-
You've stumbled into a typical room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be typical. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the bedroom.

As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a chest drawer. You make out a closed antique trunk. You can see a king-size bed. But the thing is empty.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

-= Kitchen =-
You've entered a kitchen. The room is well lit.

You make out a closed refrigerator right there by you. You make out a counter. But there isn't a thing on it. You make out a stove. The stove is standard. But there isn't a thing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an unguarded exit to the north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me see. The user has been following the steps given in the TextWorld game. They started in the bedroom, opened the chest drawer, took the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, then went east to the kitchen. Now they're in the kitchen, opened the refrigerator, took the lettuce. The next step according to the initial instructions was to rest the lettuce on the stove.

So the current state is that the lettuce is in the player's inventory. The next action should be to put it on the stove. The stove is in the kitchen, and the player is already there. The command would be "put lettuce on stove" or something similar. But in the game's context, the exact phrasing might matter. The user has to use the correct command syntax. Since the previous actions were "take lettuce from refrigerator", the next step would be to place it on the stove. So the correct command is "put lettuce on stove".
