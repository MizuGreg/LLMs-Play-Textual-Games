I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First off, ensure that the antique trunk within the bedroom is open. After that, recover the old key from the antique trunk. After that, make it so that the wooden door in the bedroom is unlocked with the old key. And then, make absolutely sure that the wooden door inside the bedroom is ajar. After opening the wooden door, go east. Then, doublecheck that the screen door is wide open. And then, attempt to travel east. And then, try to travel south. With that done, lift the milk from the floor of the garden. After stealing the milk, head north. And then, attempt to travel west. With that done, rest the milk on the stove. That's it!

-= Bedroom =-
I am sorry to announce that you are now in the bedroom. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a chest drawer. You scan the room for an antique trunk, and you find an antique trunk. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to a king-size bed. The king-size bed is standard. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. You think about smashing the king-size bed to bits, throwing the bits in the dump, etc, until you get bored.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me see. The user is in a text-based game called TextWorld. Their task is to follow a series of steps to complete the game. So far, they've opened an antique trunk, taken an old key, unlocked the wooden door, and opened it. The current score is 4 out of 6.

The user's next step, according to the original instructions, is to go east after opening the wooden door. But the user is asking if they're on the right track and if they're close to the goal. They also want to know the next action.

Looking at the current state: the wooden door is open (since they just opened it), and the next step is to go east. The user has to move east, then check the screen door, then go east again, then south, etc. So the immediate next action should be to go east. But the user is asking for confirmation, so maybe they need to proceed with that step.

But the user's last input was "open wooden door" which succeeded. Now the next step is to go east. The user's question is whether they're on the right path. Since they've completed the steps up to opening the door, it's correct. So the next command should be "go east".

-= Kitchen =-
Of every kitchen you could have sauntered into, you had to walk into an ordinary one. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You can see a closed refrigerator in the room. You can make out a counter. The counter is usual. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. You scan the room, seeing a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. You can see a kitchen island. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? On the kitchen island you can see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Okay, let me try to figure out what the next step should be. The user is in the Kitchen room after opening the wooden door from the bedroom. The original task was to go east after opening the door, then check the screen door, etc.

So far, the user tried to go east but couldn't because the screen door was closed. Then they looked again and tried help, but the screen door is still closed. The next logical step is to open the screen door. The user has the old key from the trunk, so they should use it to unlock the screen door. Once that's open, they can proceed east. Then they need to check if the screen door is wide open, then go east again, try south, etc. So the immediate action is to open the screen door with the key.

Okay, the user is stuck trying to open the screen door with the old key, but every time they try, it says "That's unlocked at the moment." Wait, maybe the key isn't working here. Let me think. The old key was used to unlock the wooden door in the bedroom. Maybe the screen door requires a different key, or perhaps the user needs to use the correct command.

Looking back at the available commands, there's "unlock ... with ..." but the user has been using "open ... with ...". Maybe the correct command is "unlock screen door with old key" instead of "open". Let me check the previous interactions. The user tried "unlock wooden door with old key" earlier, which worked. So maybe the screen door needs "unlock" instead of "open". Let me try that.

Okay, the user is repeatedly trying to unlock the screen door with the old key, but it's not working. Let me check the previous steps. The old key was taken from the antique trunk in the bedroom and used to unlock the wooden door. Maybe the screen door requires a different key, or perhaps the key isn't compatible. Alternatively, maybe the screen door is already unlocked but closed, so the user needs to open it instead of unlocking. Wait, the user tried "open screen door with old key" earlier, but the system said "That's unlocked at the moment." Maybe the correct command is just "open screen door" without the key. Or perhaps the key isn't needed here. Let me think about the game's logic. The user needs to make the screen door wide open, so maybe they just need to open it normally. Since the key was used for the wooden door, maybe the screen door is a different mechanism. The user might need to use the "open" command without the key. Let me try that.

Well, here we are in the garden.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north.

There is a milk, a half of a bag of chips, a lettuce and a shovel on the floor.

Okay, the user is in the Garden room. The description mentions that there is a milk, a half of a bag of chips, a lettuce, and a shovel on the floor. But when the user tried to take the milk from the floor, it said "You can't see any such thing." That's confusing because the description clearly states the milk is there.

Wait, maybe the correct command is "take milk" without specifying "from floor" since it's already on the floor. The game might automatically pick up items when you take them if they're on the floor. Let me check previous commands. The user tried "take milk from floor" which didn't work, so maybe just "take milk" is the right command. Let me try that.

You pick up the milk from the ground.

-= Backyard =-
You find yourself in a backyard. An ordinary one. Let's see what's in here.

You can see a set of chairs. The set of chairs is typical. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the set of chairs. You make out a bbq. The bbq is usual. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm. Oh well You can see a patio table. However, the patio table, like an empty patio table, has nothing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is an open screen door leading west. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

-= Kitchen =-
Of every kitchen you could have sauntered into, you had to walk into an ordinary one. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You can see a closed refrigerator in the room. You can make out a counter. The counter is usual. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. You scan the room, seeing a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. You can see a kitchen island. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? On the kitchen island you can see a note.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Okay, the user is in the Kitchen again, having cycled through several rooms. The original goal was to lift the milk from the garden, then head north, then west, then rest the milk on the stove. But the user has been moving between rooms without completing those steps. Now, in the Kitchen, they need to rest the milk on the stove. The milk was picked up in the Garden, so the next step is to go back to the Garden, rest the milk on the stove, and then proceed with the remaining tasks. But the current location is the Kitchen, so the user needs to go back to the Garden. However, the user's last action was going north to the Bathroom, then back to Kitchen. So the correct next step is to go south to the Garden again. Wait, but the user needs to rest the milk on the stove. The stove is in the Kitchen. So after picking up the milk in the Garden, they should go back to the Kitchen and put the milk on the stove. But the user is currently in the Kitchen. So the next action is to put the milk on the stove. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the correct command is "put milk on stove".

Okay, the user is trying to put the milk on the stove in the Bathroom, but it's not working. Let me check the previous steps. The milk was picked up in the Garden, then the user went through several rooms, ending up in the Bathroom. The stove is in the Kitchen, not the Bathroom. So the user needs to go back to the Kitchen to put the milk on the stove. The current location is the Bathroom, so the next step is to go south to the Kitchen. Then, in the Kitchen, put the milk on the stove. But the user is in the Bathroom, so the correct command is "go south" to return to the Kitchen. Then, once in the Kitchen, "put milk on stove".
