Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an exciting round of TextWorld? You do! Here is how to play! First stop, ensure that the chest drawer within the bedroom is open. And then, pick up the old key from the chest drawer. After that, make absolutely sure that the wooden door is unlocked. Then, ensure that the wooden door is open. After that, venture east. After that, move south. That done, take the bell pepper from the couch in the living room. Then, go north. Then, rest the bell pepper on the stove inside the kitchen. Alright, thanks!

-= Bedroom =-
Well, here we are in the bedroom.

You can make out a chest drawer. You can see a closed antique trunk. You make out a king-size bed. However, the king-size bed, like an empty king-size bed, has nothing on it.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps given in the instructions. First, they opened the chest drawer and picked up the old key. Now, the next step according to the initial instructions was to make sure the wooden door is unlocked. So, I need to figure out how to unlock the door.

Wait, the user has the old key. Maybe using the key on the door would unlock it. The door is closed and leading east. So the next action should be to unlock the door with the key. Let me check the previous steps again. The user has the key now, so the next logical step is to unlock the door. Then, after unlocking, they need to open the door. So the next command should be to unlock the wooden door with the old key. Let me make sure that's the correct action here.

Okay, let's see. The user has followed the steps correctly so far. They opened the chest drawer, picked up the key, unlocked the door, and opened it. The next step in the original instructions was to venture east. So after opening the door, they should move east. The current location is the bedroom, and the door leads east. So the next command should be "go east". That makes sense. Let me make sure there's no other step needed before moving east. The instructions said after opening the door, venture east. So yes, "go east" is the next action.

-= Kitchen =-
I am sorry to announce that you are now in the kitchen.

You see a closed refrigerator right there by you. You scan the room, seeing a counter. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You see a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. You can make out a kitchen island. The kitchen island is standard. On the kitchen island you make out a note. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Living Room =-
You are in a living room. A normal kind of place.

Oh, great. Here's a couch. The couch is typical. On the couch you can see a bell pepper. You see a low table. You see a remote on the low table. You can make out a tv! The tv is usual. However, the tv, like an empty tv, has nothing on it. You move on, clearly upset with your TextWorld experience.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps correctly. They went from the bedroom to the kitchen by going east, then south to the living room. The next step in the original instructions was to take the bell pepper from the couch in the living room. So now that they're in the living room, they need to pick up the bell pepper. The current location is the living room, and the couch has the bell pepper. So the next action should be "take bell pepper". That's the next step according to the instructions. Let me make sure there's no other step needed. The instructions said after venturing east and moving south, take the bell pepper. So yes, "take bell pepper" is the correct next command.

Okay, let's see. The user has taken the bell pepper from the living room and now is back in the kitchen. The next step according to the original instructions was to rest the bell pepper on the stove inside the kitchen. So now that they're in the kitchen, they need to put the bell pepper on the stove. The stove is mentioned in the kitchen description, so the next action should be "put bell pepper on stove". That's the next step after taking the bell pepper. Let me make sure there's no other step needed. The instructions said after taking the bell pepper, go north, but wait, the user just went north from the living room to the kitchen again. Wait, maybe the steps are: after taking the bell pepper, go north (which brought them back to the kitchen), then rest the bell pepper on the stove. So yes, "put bell pepper on stove" is the next correct action.
