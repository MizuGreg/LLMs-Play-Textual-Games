I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First off, open the antique trunk. After that, take the old key from the antique trunk inside the bedroom. Once you have picked up the old key, make it so that the wooden door is unlocked. After unlocking the wooden door, assure that the wooden door is opened. And then, make an attempt to go to the east. After that, look and see that the refrigerator is opened. After that, recover the lettuce from the refrigerator. If you can get your hands on the lettuce, put the lettuce on the stove. Got that? Good!

-= Bedroom =-
You arrive in a bedroom. A typical one.

You can make out a closed chest drawer. You scan the room for an antique trunk, and you find an antique trunk. You check the price tag that's still affixed to the antique trunk. Eighty bucks?! That's ridiculous! Do you know my good friend, they work for the government? I'm sure my friend could get you one of those for 45 bucks! You can see a king-size bed. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user has already opened the antique trunk and taken the old key. The next step according to the task was to unlock the wooden door. So I need to use the old key to unlock it. The door is closed, so the command should be to unlock it with the key. Then, after unlocking, they need to open the door. So first, unlock the door, then open it. But the user's next action should be to unlock the door with the key they just picked up. Let me check the previous steps again. The user is in the bedroom, has the key. The wooden door leading east is closed. So the next action is to unlock the door. The correct command would be "unlock wooden door" or "unlock door with old key". But in TextWorld, the commands are usually more direct. Since the key is in hand, the action would be to unlock the door. So the next step is to unlock the wooden door.

Let me check the previous steps again. The door was leading east, and after opening it, the next action is to go through it. So the next command is "go east".

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a typical kind of place. That is to say, you're in a kitchen.

If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a refrigerator. You can make out a counter. The counter is standard. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. This always happens, here in TextWorld! What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. Look over there! a kitchen island. On the kitchen island you can see a note. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

Okay, the user needs to open the refrigerator. They have the old key, but maybe the key isn't for the fridge. Wait, the task said after unlocking the door, they need to open the refrigerator. But the refrigerator is closed. The user has the key, but maybe the key is for the door, not the fridge. Alternatively, maybe they need to use the key to open the fridge. But the key was taken from the trunk, which was in the bedroom. The user is now in the kitchen. The refrigerator is closed. So the next action should be to open the refrigerator. The command would be "open refrigerator". Let me check the previous steps. The user has already gone east through the door, so now in the kitchen. The refrigerator is closed. So the next step is to open it.
