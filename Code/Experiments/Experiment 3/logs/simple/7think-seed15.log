It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First stop, open the chest drawer. And then, pick up the old key from the chest drawer within the bedroom. After picking up the old key, make it so that the wooden door is unlocked. After that, ensure that the wooden door within the bedroom is open. After that, move east. With that done, open the screen door. And then, go east. Following that, try to move south. Okay, and then, recover the apple from the floor of the garden. If you can get your hands on the apple, head north. That done, try to head west. And then, put the apple on the stove in the kitchen. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Bedroom =-
You find yourself in a bedroom. A typical kind of place. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You see a chest drawer. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can make out a closed antique trunk here. You see a king-size bed. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You swear loudly.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

-= Kitchen =-
You've just sauntered into a kitchen.

You make out a closed refrigerator. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. But there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the counter. You see a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a kitchen island! The kitchen island is normal. On the kitchen island you can see a note. Huh, weird.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what to do next. The user has been following a series of steps in the text adventure game. So far, they've opened the chest drawer, picked up the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door in the bedroom, then went east to the kitchen. They opened the screen door there. Now, the next step according to the original task was after opening the screen door and going east, then trying to move south. But in the current state, they're in the kitchen, having opened the screen door.

Looking at the current environment in the kitchen, there's a closed refrigerator, a stove, a kitchen island with a note, a screen door leading east (which they just opened), an open wooden door west, and the option to go north or south. The user's next step, as per the original plan, was to move south after opening the screen door and going east. Wait, but after opening the screen door, they are in the kitchen. The original instructions said after opening the screen door, go east again? Or maybe after opening the screen door, they can try moving south from the kitchen.

Wait, the original task said: "open the screen door. And then, go east. Following that, try to move south." So after opening the screen door (which they just did), the next step is to go east. But in the kitchen, the screen door is leading east. So going east from the kitchen would take them through the screen door to the next area. Then, from there, try to move south.

But the user's last action was opening the screen door, and the current location is the kitchen. So the next command should be "go east" to move through the screen door. Then, once in the next room (probably the garden or another area), they can try moving south. But the user's next input should be "go east" again. However, the assistant's previous response was "go east" when in the kitchen, but the system responded that they need to open the screen door first. Wait, the user just opened the screen door, so now they can go east. So the next action is "go east" again. Then, after moving east, they can try moving south. So the next command is "go east".

-= Backyard =-
You've entered a backyard.

You see a set of chairs. The set of chairs is ordinary. But there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You make out a bbq. However, the bbq, like an empty bbq, has nothing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a patio table! The patio table is usual. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

There is an open screen door leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked.

There is a milk, an apple, a lettuce and a shovel on the floor.
