Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an exciting round of TextWorld? You do! Here is how to play! First stop, ensure that the chest drawer within the bedroom is open. And then, pick up the old key from the chest drawer. After that, make absolutely sure that the wooden door is unlocked. Then, ensure that the wooden door is open. After that, venture east. After that, move south. That done, take the bell pepper from the couch in the living room. Then, go north. Then, rest the bell pepper on the stove inside the kitchen. Alright, thanks!

-= Bedroom =-
Well, here we are in the bedroom.

You can make out a chest drawer. You can see a closed antique trunk. You make out a king-size bed. However, the king-size bed, like an empty king-size bed, has nothing on it.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps given in the instructions. First, they opened the chest drawer and picked up the old key. Now, the next step according to the initial instructions was to make sure the wooden door is unlocked. So, I need to figure out how to unlock the door.

Wait, the user has the old key. Maybe using the key on the door would unlock it. The door is closed and leading east. So the next action should be to unlock the door with the key. Let me check the previous steps again. The user has the key now, so the next logical step is to unlock the door. Then, after unlocking, they need to open the door. So the next command should be to unlock the wooden door with the old key. Let me make sure that's the correct action here.

Okay, let me see. The user has been following the steps to open the chest drawer, pick up the key, unlock the door, and open it. Now they're at the bedroom door, which is open. The next step according to the initial instructions was to venture east. So after opening the door, the next logical step would be to move east. The user hasn't done that yet. The current location is the bedroom, and the door leading east is open. So the next action should be to go east. Let me check the previous steps again to make sure. Yes, the last action was opening the door, so the next command should be "go east".

-= Kitchen =-
I am sorry to announce that you are now in the kitchen.

You see a closed refrigerator right there by you. You scan the room, seeing a counter. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You see a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. You can make out a kitchen island. The kitchen island is standard. On the kitchen island you make out a note. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Living Room =-
You are in a living room. A normal kind of place.

Oh, great. Here's a couch. The couch is typical. On the couch you can see a bell pepper. You see a low table. You see a remote on the low table. You can make out a tv! The tv is usual. However, the tv, like an empty tv, has nothing on it. You move on, clearly upset with your TextWorld experience.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north.

Okay, let me figure out the next step here. The user has been following the instructions to open the chest drawer, pick up the key, unlock and open the wooden door, then go east to the kitchen. From the kitchen, they went south to the living room. Now, in the living room, they need to take the bell pepper from the couch.

The original goal was to pick up the bell pepper from the couch in the living room. The user just arrived there, so the next logical step is to take the bell pepper. The instructions mentioned taking the bell pepper after venturing east and moving south. Since they're now in the living room, the next action should be to pick up the bell pepper. Then, they need to rest it on the stove in the kitchen. But according to the previous steps, after taking the bell pepper, they should go north to the kitchen. Wait, the user's last action was going south to the living room. So after taking the bell pepper, they need to go north back to the kitchen to rest it on the stove. But the user's next action should be to take the bell pepper first. The current location is the living room, so the command should be "take bell pepper".

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps to complete the game. They started in the bedroom, opened the chest drawer, picked up the key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, then went east to the kitchen. From there, they went south to the living room, took the bell pepper, and went north back to the kitchen.

Now, they're in the kitchen again, and the next step is to rest the bell pepper on the stove. The current location is the kitchen, and the previous action was going north, which brought them back. The goal was to take the bell pepper from the couch in the living room, then rest it on the stove in the kitchen. 

The user's last action was going north from the living room, which led them back to the kitchen. The next logical step is to place the bell pepper on the stove. The stove is in the kitchen, and they have the bell pepper in hand. So the correct command here would be to put the bell pepper on the stove. The game's scoring system indicates they're on track, as they've completed most steps. Making sure they place the bell pepper on the stove will complete the task, leading them closer to the goal.

Okay, the user is trying to rest the bell pepper on the stove, but the command isn't recognized. Let me check the possible actions in the kitchen. The previous actions were moving between rooms and taking items. The valid commands here might be "put" instead of "rest". Since "rest" isn't a valid verb, the correct command should be "put bell pepper on stove". I need to make sure that's the right syntax. The user has to use "put" to place an item. So the next action should be "put bell pepper on stove".
