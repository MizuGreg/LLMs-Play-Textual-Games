It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First thing I need you to do is to make absolutely sure that the antique trunk is opened. And then, take the old key from the antique trunk within the bedroom. After that, check that the wooden door within the bedroom is unlocked with the old key. After that, look and see that the wooden door is open. After that, try to move east. After that, open the screen door in the kitchen. And then, venture east. Then, attempt to travel south. And then, lift the lettuce from the floor of the garden. If you have picked up the lettuce, travel north. And then, try to move west. Then, rest the lettuce on the stove. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Bedroom =-
I am excited to announce that you are now in the bedroom. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You make out a chest drawer. Hmm. You always thought you'd be more excited to see a chest drawer in a room. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to an antique trunk. You can make out a king-size bed. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this TextWorld game and has already completed some steps. They opened the antique trunk, took the old key, and now they need to unlock the wooden door in the bedroom. The next step according to the original task was to check that the door is unlocked with the old key. So the next action should be to unlock the door.

Wait, the user has the key, so they need to use it on the door. The command would be "unlock wooden door with old key". But in the game's context, maybe it's just "unlock wooden door" since the key is in their inventory. Let me check the previous steps. The user took the old key from the trunk, so they have it. The door is closed, so they need to unlock it. The correct command here is "unlock wooden door". Then after that, they need to open the door. So the next step is to unlock the door with the key. The user's next action should be "unlock wooden door".

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps correctly so far. They opened the antique trunk, took the old key, unlocked the wooden door, and opened it. Now they need to move east. The next step in the original task was to "try to move east" after opening the door. Since the door is open and they're in the bedroom, moving east would take them to the next room, probably the kitchen. So the next action should be "go east" or "move east". The user has to make sure they use the correct command. The previous steps were all about the bedroom, so moving east makes sense. I need to confirm that "move east" is the correct command here. The game's environment might use "go east" instead, but based on the previous commands like "open antique trunk" and "unlock wooden door", it's likely that "go east" is the right verb. Wait, the user's previous action after opening the door was "go east"? Or was it "move east"? The original instructions say "try to move east", so maybe "move east" is the correct command. But in the game's context, sometimes "go" is used. However, the user has been using commands like "open antique trunk" and "take old key from antique trunk", so maybe "move east" is acceptable. Alternatively, "go east". But the user's previous action was "open wooden door", so maybe "go east" is the next step. Let me check the previous interactions. The user's last action was "open wooden door", and the next step is to move east. The correct command here is "go east" or "move east". Since the user has been using "go" in some commands, like "go north", but in the initial steps, they used "open" and "take". However, the original task says "try to move east", so the command should be "move east". But I need to check the game's possible commands. Since the user is in the bedroom, after opening the door, moving east would take them to the kitchen. So the next action is "move east".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in this text-based game. So far, they've opened the antique trunk, taken the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door in the bedroom. Then they tried to move east, but the system kept prompting them to name something more substantial. Hmm, maybe the game is expecting a more specific action than just "move east"?

Wait, the original task said after opening the wooden door in the bedroom, they need to look and see that the door is open. Then try to move east. But maybe after moving east, they enter the kitchen and need to open the screen door there. But the user tried to move east again, and the system didn't accept it. Maybe the correct action after opening the door is to "move east" but the system is confused because the previous action was moving east. Or perhaps there's a different command needed here.

Alternatively, maybe the game is expecting them to "look" or "examine" the door after opening it to confirm it's open. But the user's next step was to move east. However, the system kept saying "name something more substantial," which might mean that "move east" isn't the right command here. Maybe they need to "go east" instead? Or perhaps there's a specific object or action they need to take before moving east.

Wait, the original instructions said after opening the wooden door in the bedroom, they should "look and see that the wooden door is open." So maybe the user needs to check the door's state first. But the user already opened it, so maybe the next step is to move east. However, the system is not accepting "move east" again. Maybe the correct command is "go east" or "move east" is not valid here. Or perhaps the game is in a state where moving east is possible only after certain conditions are met.

Alternatively, maybe the user is in the bedroom, opened the door, and now needs to move east into the next room, which is the kitchen. So the correct action is "move east" but the system is not recognizing it. But the user tried it again and got the same response. Maybe the game is expecting a different command, like "open screen door" in the kitchen once they enter. But the user hasn't entered the kitchen yet.

Wait, the original plan was: after moving east from the bedroom, open the screen door in the kitchen, then venture east again, then travel south, etc. So perhaps after moving east from the bedroom, they enter the kitchen. But the system is not allowing "move east" again. Maybe the correct command is "go east" instead of "move east"? Or maybe the game is expecting them to "open the screen door" in the kitchen once they are there.

But the user's last action was moving east, which the system rejected. So maybe the correct action is to "look" or "examine" the door again to confirm it's open, but the user's next step was to move east. Alternatively, maybe the game is in a state where moving east is not possible yet, and the user needs to do something else first.

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to "look" at the door to confirm it's open, but the system is expecting a different command. However, the user's next action was to move east, which the system didn't accept. So perhaps the correct action is to "go east" instead of "move east". But the user tried that again and got the same response.

Hmm, maybe the game is expecting the user to "open the screen door" in the kitchen after moving east. But the user hasn't moved east yet. So perhaps the correct action is to "move east" again, but the system is not accepting it. Maybe there's a typo or a specific command required. Alternatively, the user might need to "look" at the door again to confirm it's open before moving east.

But according to the original instructions, after opening the door, the user should "look and see that the wooden door is open," which they did. Then "try to move east." So the next step is to move east. However, the system is not accepting "move east" again. Maybe the correct command is "go east" instead. Let me check the initial commands. The user's first action was "go north," but in this case, the user is in the bedroom, so maybe "go east" is the correct command. But the user tried "move east" and it didn't work. Maybe the game is using "go east" as the correct command.

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to "open the screen door" in the kitchen after moving east, but that's part of the next steps. So perhaps the correct action is to "move east" again, but the system is not allowing it. Maybe the user needs to "look" at the door again to confirm it's open, but that's not part of the original steps.

Alternatively, maybe the user is in the bedroom, opened the door, and now needs to "go east" to enter the kitchen. So the correct command is "go east," but the user tried "move east" and it didn't work. Therefore, the correct action is "go east."

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game where they have to follow a series of steps to win. So far, they've opened the antique trunk, taken the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door in the bedroom, moved east to the kitchen, opened the screen door there. Now they're at the kitchen, and the next step in the original task was to "venture east" after opening the screen door. But the user just opened the screen door, and the current location is the kitchen. The kitchen has a screen door leading east, so maybe they need to go east from there.

Wait, the user's last action was opening the screen door in the kitchen. The prompt says after opening the screen door, they should "venture east." So the next command should be "go east" or "move east." But the system might have some restrictions, like needing to use specific commands. Looking back at previous interactions, the user has been using commands like "go east," "open screen door," etc. So the next logical step is to move east from the kitchen. The response after opening the screen door mentions that there's a closed screen door leading east, so maybe after opening it, they can go through it. But the user already opened it, so the next step is to move east. The assistant should output "go east" as the next command.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps to complete the game. They started in the bedroom, opened the antique trunk, took the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, then moved east to the kitchen. They opened the screen door, went east again to the backyard, then south to the garden.

In the garden, there's a lettuce on the floor. The next step according to the original task was to lift the lettuce from the floor of the garden. Once picked up, they needed to travel north, then west, then rest the lettuce on the stove. But the user hasn't picked up the lettuce yet. The current location is the garden, and the lettuce is there. So the next action should be to pick up the lettuce. The user's last action was "go south", which led them to the garden. Now they need to pick up the lettuce. The correct command here is "take lettuce from floor" or something similar. But in the game's context, the command might be "take lettuce". Let me check the previous commands. The user had to "lift the lettuce from the floor of the garden." So the correct action is "take lettuce" or "pick up lettuce". The game's previous interactions used "take" for items, so the next step is to take the lettuce.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the steps in the TextWorld game. They've already opened the antique trunk, taken the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, moved east to the kitchen, opened the screen door, went east to the backyard, and then south to the garden. Now, in the garden, they need to pick up the lettuce from the floor. But when they tried "take lettuce from floor", the game responded that it can't see any such thing.

Wait, the game's description of the garden says: "There is a milk, an apple, a lettuce and a shovel on the floor." So the lettuce is indeed there. But the user's command might not be correctly formatted. Maybe the game expects just "take lettuce" without specifying "from floor" since it's on the floor by default. Let me check the previous steps. The user tried "take lettuce from floor" and got an error. Maybe the correct command is just "take lettuce". Let me try that. If that doesn't work, maybe "pick up lettuce" or "get lettuce". But according to the game's previous responses, the correct syntax might be "take lettuce". Let me try that.

Okay, let's see. The user has to follow a series of steps in this text-based game. So far, they've opened the antique trunk, taken the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, moved east to the kitchen, opened the screen door, moved east again to the backyard, then went south to the garden. In the garden, they picked up the lettuce and went north back to the backyard.

Now, the next step according to the original task was to "rest the lettuce on the stove." But the user is currently in the backyard. The stove is in the kitchen, so they need to go back to the kitchen. Let me check the previous locations.

After the garden, they went north to the backyard. The kitchen was earlier when they were in the backyard after opening the screen door. Wait, the user is now in the backyard again. The kitchen is east of the backyard, but they already opened the screen door there. Wait, the kitchen was accessed by moving east from the bedroom, then later they went east from the kitchen to the backyard. Now, to get back to the kitchen, they need to go west from the backyard. But the backyard has an open screen door leading west, which would take them back to the kitchen. Then, in the kitchen, they can go north to the bedroom or south to the garden, but the stove is in the kitchen. So the correct path is to go west from the backyard to the kitchen, then find the stove and rest the lettuce there.

But the user's last action was "go north" from the garden, which brought them back to the backyard. Now, the next step is to go west to the kitchen, then rest the lettuce on the stove. However, the user hasn't mentioned the stove yet. So the next command should be "go west" to reach the kitchen, then "rest lettuce on stove". But according to the instructions, the user must only output the next action. Since they are in the backyard, the next step is to go west to the kitchen. So the correct command is "go west".

I am excited to announce that you are now in the bedroom. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You make out a chest drawer. Hmm. You always thought you'd be more excited to see a chest drawer in a room. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to an antique trunk. The antique trunk is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You can make out a king-size bed. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is an open wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps in the TextWorld game. They started in the bedroom, opened the antique trunk, took the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, then moved east to the kitchen. They opened the screen door, went east again to the backyard, then south to the garden where they picked up the lettuce. Now they're back in the kitchen, then west to the bedroom again.

The next step according to the original task was to rest the lettuce on the stove. But in the current location, they're in the bedroom. Wait, the lettuce was picked up in the garden, then they went back to the kitchen, then to the bedroom. So they need to go back to the kitchen to put the lettuce on the stove. But the current location is the bedroom. So the next action should be to go east back to the kitchen. Then, once in the kitchen, rest the lettuce on the stove. But the user's last action was going west to the bedroom, so the next command should be to go east to the kitchen. Then, after that, rest the lettuce. But the user's last input was "go west", leading them back to the bedroom. So the next step is to go east again to the kitchen. Then, the correct action would be to rest the lettuce on the stove. But the user's current location is the bedroom, so they need to go east to the kitchen first. Therefore, the next command should be "go east".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in this TextWorld game. Their goal is to open the antique trunk, get the key, unlock and open the bedroom door, move east, open the kitchen screen door, go east again, then move south, pick up the lettuce, take it north, then west, and rest it on the stove to win.

So far, they've managed to open the trunk, take the key, unlock and open the bedroom door, move east to the kitchen, open the screen door, go east to the backyard, pick up the lettuce, go north back to the kitchen, then west to the bedroom. Then they went north again to the bathroom. Now, they're in the bathroom, and the next step should be to go south back to the kitchen. But wait, the user's last action was "go north" from the kitchen to the bathroom. The bathroom has an exit to the south, which is unguarded. So the next logical step is to go south back to the kitchen. But the user might have missed something here. However, according to the original plan, after resting the lettuce on the stove, they win. But they haven't done that yet. Wait, the lettuce was picked up in the garden, then they went north to the kitchen. Now in the bathroom, they need to find the stove. But the stove is in the kitchen. So maybe they need to go back to the kitchen, find the stove, and put the lettuce there. But the current location is the bathroom. So the correct next step is to go south back to the kitchen. Then, from the kitchen, go to the stove and rest the lettuce. But the user's last action was "go north" to the bathroom. So the next action should be "go south" to return to the kitchen. Then, from the kitchen, they can go to the stove. But the user might not have considered that. However, the game's current state is in the bathroom, so the next command should be "go south".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in this text-based game. Their goal is to open the antique trunk, get the key, unlock and open the door, move east, open the kitchen screen door, go east again, then move south, pick up the lettuce, take it north, then west, and finally put it on the stove to win.

So far, they've managed to get the key, unlock and open the door, move east to the kitchen, open the screen door, go east to the backyard, then south to the garden where they picked up the lettuce. Then they went north back to the backyard, west to the kitchen, and then north again to the bathroom. Now they're back in the kitchen again, and the prompt says to go north again. But the user is stuck here, maybe because they're looping between rooms without making progress towards the final steps.

Wait, the next step after picking up the lettuce was to travel north, which they did, then west to the kitchen. Then they need to rest the lettuce on the stove. But the stove is in the kitchen. So the user has the lettuce, they need to go to the stove in the kitchen and put it there. But in the current setup, the kitchen has a stove, but the user hasn't interacted with it yet. So the next action should be to go to the stove and put the lettuce down. However, the game's current state after the last move was in the bathroom, then going south back to the kitchen. Now, in the kitchen, the user has the lettuce, so they need to go to the stove and rest the lettuce there. The command would be to "rest lettuce on stove" or something similar. But the game's commands are limited to movement and interactions. The user might need to first go to the stove's location, then use the command to rest the lettuce. But in the current prompt, the user is in the kitchen again, so the next step is to go to the stove and put the lettuce down. The correct command here would be "rest lettuce on stove" or "put lettuce on stove". However, the game might require the user to first go to the stove's location. But in the kitchen description, the stove is mentioned as being there. So the user can directly rest the lettuce on the stove. Therefore, the next action should be to rest the lettuce on the stove, which would complete the game.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to rest the lettuce on the stove. But in the current location, which is the bathroom, there's no stove mentioned. The previous location was the kitchen, where there's a stove. But after moving around, they ended up in the bathroom. So the problem is that the stove isn't here. The correct action would be to go back to the kitchen where the stove is located. The user needs to move north to get back to the kitchen. Then, they can rest the lettuce on the stove there. So the next command should be "go north" to return to the kitchen.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in this TextWorld game. Their goal is to eventually win by completing all the tasks mentioned. Let me recap the steps they've taken so far.

First, they opened the antique trunk in the bedroom, took the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door. Then they moved east to the kitchen, opened the screen door, went east again to the backyard, then south to the garden where they picked up the lettuce. They went north back to the backyard, west to the kitchen, then north to the bathroom, and back to the kitchen. Now they're stuck again trying to rest the lettuce on the stove, but the command isn't recognized.

Wait, the user tried "rest lettuce on stove" but got an error. The problem is that in TextWorld, commands are usually verbs. "Rest" might not be the correct verb here. The correct action might be "put" instead of "rest". So maybe the user needs to use "put lettuce on stove" instead.

Looking at the current location, they're in the kitchen. The stove is present, so the correct command should be "put lettuce on stove". The previous attempt used "rest", which isn't a valid verb here. So the next step is to correct that command to "put".

Once that's done, the user would complete the task, and then the game would end with a win. So the correct action now is to use "put" instead of "rest".
