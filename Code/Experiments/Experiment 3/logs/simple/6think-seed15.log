It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First stop, open the chest drawer. And then, pick up the old key from the chest drawer within the bedroom. After picking up the old key, make it so that the wooden door is unlocked. After that, ensure that the wooden door within the bedroom is open. After that, move east. With that done, open the screen door. And then, go east. Following that, try to move south. Okay, and then, recover the apple from the floor of the garden. If you can get your hands on the apple, head north. That done, try to head west. And then, put the apple on the stove in the kitchen. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Bedroom =-
You find yourself in a bedroom. A typical kind of place. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You see a chest drawer. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can make out a closed antique trunk here. You see a king-size bed. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You swear loudly.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

You make out a closed refrigerator. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. But there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the counter. You see a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a kitchen island! The kitchen island is normal. On the kitchen island you can see a note. Huh, weird.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game and has followed a series of steps to progress. They've opened the chest drawer, picked up the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, then went east into the kitchen. Now they're at the kitchen, where there's a screen door leading east that they need to open before they can go through it.

The user's current location is the kitchen, and the next step they need to do is open the screen door. The previous attempt to go east didn't work because the screen door was closed. So the correct action here is to open the screen door first. The user's score is at 5/7, so they need to continue following the steps correctly to reach the goal.

The original goal was to recover the apple from the garden, put it on the stove in the kitchen, and then head north. So far, they've done the necessary steps in the bedroom and kitchen. Now, after opening the screen door, they can proceed east again. Then, after moving south, they need to go to the garden, recover the apple, and so on.

The user is asking if they're making the right actions and if they're close to the goal. Based on the steps taken so far, they are on the right track. The next immediate action is to open the screen door. Once that's done, they can go east again. Then, moving south would take them to the garden where the apple is. After that, they can return to the kitchen, put the apple on the stove, and finally head north to win.

So the next command should be to open the screen door. That's the logical next step after being in the kitchen and needing to go east. The user has to make sure they follow each step carefully, as some doors need to be opened before they can be passed through.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps in the TextWorld game. Their goal is to recover the apple, put it on the stove in the kitchen, and eventually win. So far, they've picked up the apple in the garden and went back to the backyard.

Now, the next step according to the original plan was to head west after going north. But in the current scene, they're in the backyard again. The available exits are west (open screen door) and south (unblocked). The user needs to go west to return to the kitchen, then proceed to the kitchen where the stove is. But the user's last action was "go north", which brought them back to the backyard. Now, they need to go west to get back to the kitchen. Once in the kitchen, they can put the apple on the stove. Let me check the previous steps to make sure.

Yes, the user has the apple. The next logical step is to go west through the screen door to the kitchen. Then, they can interact with the stove. The user hasn't mentioned putting the apple on the stove yet, but the original plan says after getting the apple, head north (which they did, leading back to backyard), then west to the kitchen. So the next action should be going west from the backyard. The user's last action was "go north", so now they need to "go west" to reach the kitchen. Then, once in the kitchen, they can put the apple on the stove. That should complete the task and win the game.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Kitchen and Bathroom. They keep going north and south, which is causing them to repeat the same rooms. The original goal was to recover the apple and put it on the stove in the kitchen. The user already picked up the apple in the garden and went back to the kitchen. But they might not have placed the apple on the stove yet.

Wait, the last action was going north from the kitchen to the bathroom, then south back to kitchen. The user needs to make sure they put the apple on the stove. The stove is in the kitchen. So the next step should be to go to the stove, place the apple there. But in the current setup, the user is in the kitchen again. They have the apple in their inventory. So the correct action is to go to the stove, then put the apple on it. But the game's current state shows the stove is closed. Wait, in the kitchen description, the stove is mentioned as "you see a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though." So the stove is there but maybe needs to be interacted with. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next step is to go to the stove, then put the apple on it. But the user is currently in the kitchen. So the next command should be to go to the stove, but how? The kitchen has a stove, but the user might need to interact with it. However, the available commands are moving between rooms. The user is in the kitchen, so maybe the next step is to go to the stove (but the stove is a noun, not a direction). Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the 'put' command. But the game's previous actions only allowed movement and picking up items. The user has the apple, so they need to put it on the stove. But the stove is in the kitchen. So the correct action is to go to the stove (but how?), then put the apple there. However, the game might require the user to first go to the stove's location. But in the kitchen, the stove is already present. So maybe the user needs to use the 'put apple on stove' command. But the game's previous interactions only allowed movement and picking up. Wait, in the garden, the user picked up the apple. Then they went back to the kitchen. Now, they need to put the apple on the stove. So the next action should be 'put apple on stove'. But the user is in the kitchen. So the correct command is 'put apple on stove'. However, the game might require the user to first go to the stove's location. But in the kitchen, the stove is already there. So the user can directly put the apple on the stove. Therefore, the next action is 'put apple on stove'.
