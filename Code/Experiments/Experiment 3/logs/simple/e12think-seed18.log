Welcome to TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, you could, like, open the chest drawer. Then, pick up the old key from the chest drawer. After picking up the old key, assure that the wooden door is unlocked. Then, ensure that the wooden door is open. After pulling open the wooden door, take a trip east. And then, make sure that the screen door is wide open. After that, make an effort to move east. With that done, attempt to take a trip south. Then, pick-up the bell pepper from the floor of the garden. And then, attempt to go to the north. If you can succeed at that, make an effort to take a trip west. And then, rest the bell pepper on the stove. Got that? Good!

-= Bedroom =-
You are in a bedroom. A standard kind of place.

You can make out a chest drawer. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You see a closed antique trunk close by. Look over there! a king-size bed. The king-size bed appears to be empty.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

You arrive in a kitchen. A standard one.

You see a refrigerator. You check the price tag that's still affixed to the refrigerator. 100 bucks? What a deal! You'll have to ask where they got this! You see a counter. The counter is typical. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. Look over there! a kitchen island. You wonder idly who left that here. The kitchen island is usual. On the kitchen island you see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Backyard =-
You've entered a backyard. You can barely contain your excitement.

You scan the room for a set of chairs, and you find a set of chairs! The set of chairs is typical. But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? What's that over there? It looks like it's a bbq. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a bbq, go to TextWorld. However, the bbq, like an empty bbq, has nothing on it. You can see a patio table. The patio table is normal. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

There is an open screen door leading west. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

I am so happy to announce that you are now in the garden. You begin to take stock of what's here.

-= Living Room =-
You're now in a living room.

You can see a couch. On the couch you make out a tomato plant. You smell an intriguing smell, and follow it to a low table. The low table is ordinary. On the low table you see a remote. Huh, weird. You can see a tv. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hm. Oh well

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what the next step should be. The user has been following the instructions step by step, and they're currently in the Living Room. The goal was to eventually rest the bell pepper on the stove. Let me recap the steps taken so far.

First, they opened the chest drawer, picked up the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, went east to the Kitchen, opened the screen door, went east again to the Backyard, then south to the Garden where they picked up the bell pepper. Then they went north back to the Backyard, west to the Kitchen, and then south again to the Living Room.

Now, in the Living Room, the next step according to the original task was to "rest the bell pepper on the stove." But the stove is in the Kitchen. However, the user is currently in the Living Room. So they need to go back to the Kitchen to place the bell pepper on the stove.

Looking at the current location, the Living Room has an exit to the north, but that's probably back to where they came from. The Kitchen is west, as per the previous steps. Wait, in the Kitchen, there's a stove mentioned. So the plan is to go from the Living Room back to the Kitchen, then place the bell pepper on the stove.

But the user is in the Living Room now. The available exits here are north, but the Kitchen is west. Wait, in the Living Room description, it says there's an exit to the north. But the previous steps had the user moving through the Kitchen and Backyard. Maybe the Living Room is connected to the Kitchen via the west direction? Or perhaps the user needs to go north from the Living Room to reach another area, but that might not be necessary.

Wait, the user's last action was "go south" from the Kitchen to the Living Room. So the Living Room's exit to the north would lead back to the Kitchen. So from the Living Room, going north would take them back to the Kitchen. Then, in the Kitchen, they can place the bell pepper on the stove.

So the next step is to go north from the Living Room back to the Kitchen, then put the bell pepper on the stove. But the user hasn't done that yet. The current location is the Living Room, so the next command should be "go north" to return to the Kitchen. Then, in the Kitchen, they can interact with the stove to place the bell pepper.

But the user's last input was "go south" leading to the Living Room. So the next action should be "go north" to return to the Kitchen. Then, once in the Kitchen, they can "put the bell pepper on the stove."

But the user's next move is to go north from the Living Room. So the correct command here is "go north."
</think>go north
