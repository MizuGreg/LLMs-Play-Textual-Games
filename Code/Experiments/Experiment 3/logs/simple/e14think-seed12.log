I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First off, ensure that the antique trunk within the bedroom is open. After that, recover the old key from the antique trunk. After that, make it so that the wooden door in the bedroom is unlocked with the old key. And then, make absolutely sure that the wooden door inside the bedroom is ajar. After opening the wooden door, go east. Then, doublecheck that the screen door is wide open. And then, attempt to travel east. And then, try to travel south. With that done, lift the milk from the floor of the garden. After stealing the milk, head north. And then, attempt to travel west. With that done, rest the milk on the stove. That's it!

-= Bedroom =-
I am sorry to announce that you are now in the bedroom. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a chest drawer. You scan the room for an antique trunk, and you find an antique trunk. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to a king-size bed. The king-size bed is standard. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. You think about smashing the king-size bed to bits, throwing the bits in the dump, etc, until you get bored.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in the game, trying to take the milk from the floor in the garden. They've tried "take milk from floor" three times, but it's not working. The game says "You can't see any such thing." Wait, but in the Garden description, it says there's a milk, a half of a bag of chips, a lettuce, and a shovel on the floor. So why can't they take the milk?

Maybe the correct command is just "take milk" without specifying "from floor" since the milk is already on the floor. The game might be expecting a simpler command. Let me check the previous steps. The user was told to "lift the milk from the floor of the garden." So maybe the correct command is "take milk" or "pick up milk". The game's parser might not recognize "from floor" in that context. Let me try that. If the user says "take milk", it should work. Alternatively, maybe "get milk" is the right verb. But the user has been using "take" so far. Let me try "take milk" again.

Okay, the user is trying to navigate the game and has successfully taken the milk. Now they need to head north. The problem is that "head north" isn't recognized as a valid command. Let me check the available commands in the Garden scene.

In the Garden description, the user is told to "head north" but the game doesn't recognize it. Maybe the correct command is "go north" instead of "head north". The user has been using "head" previously, but maybe the game expects "go" for movement. Let me check previous interactions. Earlier, the user used "go east" and "go south", which worked. So perhaps "go north" is the correct verb here. The user might be using "head" instead of "go". Let me try changing "head north" to "go north".

You can see a closed refrigerator in the room. You can make out a counter. The counter is usual. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. You scan the room, seeing a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. You can see a kitchen island. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? On the kitchen island you can see a note.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Kitchen and Bathroom. They keep going north and south, which isn't helping. The original goal was to rest the milk on the stove. The user has the milk, so they need to go to the kitchen again, find the stove, and put the milk there. But they keep getting redirected. Maybe they need to go back to the Kitchen through the west door, then find the stove and put the milk down. The correct command should be "put milk on stove" once they're in the Kitchen. But they've been moving around without focusing on that step. So the next action should be to go back to the Kitchen and then place the milk on the stove.
