Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, doublecheck that the antique trunk in the bedroom is open. Then, pick up the old key from the antique trunk. Then, make it so that the wooden door within the bedroom is unlocked. Then, open the wooden door. After opening the wooden door, venture east. Then, open the screen door. Then, make an attempt to head east. That done, take a trip south. Then, pick up the milk from the floor of the garden. After getting the milk, try to head north. That done, attempt to take a trip west. Then, sit the milk on the stove in the kitchen. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Bedroom =-
You find yourself in a bedroom. An usual one. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You can see a chest drawer. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's an antique trunk. Were you looking for a king-size bed? Because look over there, it's a king-size bed. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps given. So far, they've opened the antique trunk, picked up the old key, unlocked the wooden door, and opened it. Now they're in the next room, probably the east room since they opened the door leading east.

The next step in the original instructions was to venture east after opening the door. So after opening the wooden door, the user would move east. Then they need to open the screen door. Wait, the user just opened the wooden door, so the next action should be to go east. Let me check the previous steps again.

The user's last action was opening the wooden door, and the next instruction is "venture east". So the next command should be "go east". Then, after that, they need to open the screen door. But the user hasn't done that yet. So after going east, they'll face a screen door, which they need to open. Then attempt to head east again. Then go south, pick up milk, etc.

But the user's current location is after opening the wooden door. The next step is to go east. So the correct command here is "go east".

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.

You make out a closed refrigerator in the corner. You make out a counter. The counter is normal. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a stove. The stove is ordinary. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can see a kitchen island. Now why would someone leave that there? On the kitchen island you see a note. You shudder, but continue examining the room.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

-= Backyard =-
You've just sauntered into a backyard.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a set of chairs. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Sometimes, just sometimes, TextWorld can just be the worst. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a bbq. But the thing is empty. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a patio table. But the thing is empty.

There is an open screen door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps given in the initial instructions. They started in the bedroom, opened the antique trunk, picked up the key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, then went east to the kitchen. They opened the screen door, went east again to the backyard, then south to the garden.

In the garden, they found a lettuce, milk, a half-bag of chips, and a shovel. The next step according to the original plan was to pick up the milk from the floor of the garden. The user has already done that, so now they need to try to head north. The instruction says after getting the milk, try to head north, then attempt to take a trip west. Then sit the milk on the stove in the kitchen.

Wait, the current location is the garden. The user just found the milk, so they need to pick it up. The next step in the plan is after picking up the milk, try to head north. So first, pick up the milk. Then go north. Then west. Then sit the milk on the stove.

But in the last message, the user is in the garden, and the response was "go south" which led them to the garden. Now, the next step is to pick up the milk. The user hasn't done that yet. So the next action should be to pick up the milk. Then, after that, they need to go north. But the user's last action was "go south", which brought them to the garden. Now, they need to pick up the milk first. So the correct next step is to pick up the milk. Then proceed to go north as per the plan.
