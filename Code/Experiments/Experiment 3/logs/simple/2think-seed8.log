Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, doublecheck that the antique trunk in the bedroom is open. Then, pick up the old key from the antique trunk. Then, make it so that the wooden door within the bedroom is unlocked. Then, open the wooden door. After opening the wooden door, venture east. Then, open the screen door. Then, make an attempt to head east. That done, take a trip south. Then, pick up the milk from the floor of the garden. After getting the milk, try to head north. That done, attempt to take a trip west. Then, sit the milk on the stove in the kitchen. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Bedroom =-
You find yourself in a bedroom. An usual one. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You can see a chest drawer. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's an antique trunk. Were you looking for a king-size bed? Because look over there, it's a king-size bed. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me see. The user has been following the steps given. First, they checked the antique trunk in the bedroom, opened it, picked up the old key. Then they needed to unlock the wooden door in the bedroom. The next step after getting the key would be to use it to unlock the door.

Wait, the current location is the bedroom. The wooden door is closed and leading east. The user has the key, so they should try to unlock the door with the key. The next action should be to unlock the door. But in the game's context, maybe the command is "unlock wooden door" or "use key on wooden door". But the previous actions were "open antique trunk" and "pick up old key". So the next logical step is to unlock the door with the key. Let me check the previous messages. The user was told to "make it so that the wooden door within the bedroom is unlocked" after picking up the key. So the next action should be to unlock the door. The correct command would be "unlock wooden door". But I need to make sure that's the right action here. Alternatively, maybe "use key on wooden door". But the game might expect "unlock wooden door" as the command. Let me confirm based on the previous interactions. The user was told to "make it so that the wooden door... is unlocked", so the action would be to unlock it. So the next command is "unlock wooden door".

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps given. They started by opening the antique trunk in the bedroom, picked up the old key, unlocked the wooden door, and opened it. Now they're in the next room, probably the garden or another area.

The next step in the original instructions was to venture east after opening the wooden door. So after opening the door, the user should go east. But the user's last action was opening the wooden door, and the next step according to the instructions is to "venture east." So the next command should be "go east." But wait, the user might need to check if the door is open and then move east. Since the door was just opened, the next logical step is to go east. The user's previous action was opening the door, so the next action is to go east. Then, after that, they need to open the screen door, but that's after venturing east. So the immediate next action is "go east."

You are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.

You make out a closed refrigerator in the corner. You make out a counter. The counter is normal. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a stove. The stove is ordinary. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can see a kitchen island. Now why would someone leave that there? On the kitchen island you see a note. You shudder, but continue examining the room.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Kitchen scene. The previous action was trying to go east, but the screen door is closed. The user needs to open it first. The current score is 5/7. The original goal was to perform a series of actions starting from the bedroom, then moving through different areas, picking up items, and finally sitting the milk on the stove.

So, the next logical step is to open the screen door. The user was told that they need to open the screen door before heading east. The user's last action was "go east", which didn't work because the door was closed. Now, the correct action would be to open the screen door. The user should type "open screen door" to proceed. The score is 5/7, so they're on the right track. The next step is to open the door to continue moving east. The user needs to follow the instructions carefully to avoid getting stuck again.

As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a patio table. But the thing is empty.

There is an open screen door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Backyard, and the next step after going east from the Kitchen was opening the screen door, which they did. Now they're in the Backyard. The original goal was to pick up the milk from the garden and then do various steps. The user has already gone through the bedroom, opened the trunk, got the key, unlocked and opened the door, went east to the kitchen, opened the screen door, and then went east again to the backyard.

Now, the next step according to the original plan was to take a trip south from the backyard. The user is in the Backyard, and the description mentions that there's an exit to the south that's unguarded. So the next action should be to go south. That would take them to the garden where the milk is located. The user needs to pick up the milk there. So the correct command here is "go south".

From there, they opened the screen door, went east again to the backyard, then south to the garden where they picked up the milk.

Wait, the original goal was to sit the milk on the stove in the kitchen. The user has the milk now, so the next action should be to go to the stove. But in the current location, they're in the kitchen. The stove is mentioned as being in the kitchen. So the next step is to go to the stove and place the milk there. But the user has to first go to the stove. The command would be "go to stove" or "go to the stove". But in the game's context, maybe the exact command is "go to stove" or "go to the stove". Let me check the previous commands. The user has been using commands like "go east", "open screen door", etc. So probably the correct command here is "go to stove" or "go to the stove". But the game might require "go to stove" without the article. Alternatively, maybe "go to the stove". But the user's previous actions include "go east" and "go west", so maybe "go to stove" is acceptable. However, in the kitchen description, the stove is mentioned as "a stove". So the correct command would be "go to stove". But I need to make sure. The user is in the kitchen, and the stove is there. So the next action is to go to the stove. Then, after reaching the stove, they can put the milk on it. But the user's last action was "go west", which brought them back to the kitchen. Now they need to go to the stove. So the next command should be "go to stove".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in this text-based game. So far, they've opened the antique trunk, picked up the key, unlocked and opened the bedroom door, went east to the kitchen, opened the screen door, went east again to the backyard, then south to the garden where they picked up the milk. Then they went north back to the backyard, west to the kitchen.

Now, in the kitchen, they tried to go to the stove but got an error saying it's not visible. The current location is the kitchen, and the previous steps mention a stove in the kitchen. But the user's last action was "go to stove", which didn't work. The user is at the kitchen, and the task was to "sit the milk on the stove in the kitchen." So the next logical step is to try to interact with the stove. But since the user can't go to the stove directly, maybe they need to use the milk they have and place it on the stove. However, the game's commands might require specific actions. Since the user has the milk, perhaps the correct action is to "put milk on stove" or something similar. But the game's previous commands were more about moving and interacting with objects. The user might need to use the correct command syntax. Since the user tried "go to stove" and it didn't work, maybe the correct command is "put milk on stove" or "sit milk on stove" as per the original instruction. The original goal was to "sit the milk on the stove in the kitchen." So the next action should be to put the milk on the stove. The user has the milk, so the command would be "put milk on stove" or "sit milk on stove". The game might accept either. Since the user previously used "sit the milk on the stove", maybe the correct command is "sit milk on stove".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the instructions to sit the milk on the stove in the kitchen. They tried "sit milk on stove" but the system said it didn't understand. Maybe the correct command is different. Let me check the previous interactions.

Earlier, the user picked up the milk in the garden and then went north to the backyard, then west back to the kitchen. Now, in the kitchen, they need to put the milk on the stove. The problem is that the command "sit milk on stove" isn't recognized. Maybe the correct verb is "put" instead of "sit"? Or maybe "place"?

Looking at the game's previous commands, the user used "pick up" and "open" which are verbs. So perhaps "put" is the right verb here. The correct command might be "put milk on stove". Let me try that. Alternatively, maybe "place milk on stove". But the system might expect a specific phrasing. Since the user tried "sit" and it didn't work, maybe "put" is the right choice. Let me try "put milk on stove".
