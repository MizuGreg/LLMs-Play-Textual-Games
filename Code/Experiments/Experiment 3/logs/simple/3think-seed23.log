You are now playing a profound session of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First of all, ensure that the antique trunk is open. And then, recover the old key from the antique trunk in the bedroom. Then, check that the wooden door is unlocked with the old key. Then, open the wooden door. And then, move east. And then, make absolutely sure that the screen door is open. Having opened the screen door, attempt to head east. With that done, move south. Then, retrieve the apple from the floor of the garden. And then, make an attempt to venture north. If you can succeed at that, head west. With that accomplished, sit the apple on the stove inside the kitchen. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Bedroom =-
Well, here we are in a bedroom.

You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a chest drawer, so there's that. You make out a closed antique trunk in the corner. You make out a king-size bed. The king-size bed is typical. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me see. The user is playing this text adventure game. They've already opened the antique trunk and took the old key from it. The next step in the original instructions was to check that the wooden door is unlocked with the old key. So now, they need to use the key to unlock the door.

Wait, the current location is the bedroom. The wooden door leading east is mentioned as closed. So the next logical step is to unlock that door with the old key. The user has the key, so they should try to unlock the door. The command would be "unlock wooden door" or something similar. But in TextWorld, the exact phrasing matters. The previous action was "take old key from antique trunk", so maybe the next step is to use the key on the door. The correct command here is likely "unlock wooden door with old key" or "use old key on wooden door". But looking at the previous interactions, the user was told to "check that the wooden door is unlocked with the old key". So maybe the action is "unlock wooden door". Let me check the history again.

The user's previous action was "take old key from antique trunk", which worked. Now, the next step is to unlock the door. The correct command would be "unlock wooden door". The system message says to only output the action, so the answer should be "unlock wooden door".

<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what to do next. The user has been following the steps given in the initial instructions. So far, they've opened the antique trunk, taken the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, then went east to the kitchen. Now, in the kitchen, there's a screen door leading east, a wooden door west, and exits to north and south.

The next step according to the original plan was to make sure the screen door is open. The user mentioned that after opening the screen door, they should attempt to head east. So maybe the first thing here is to open the screen door. But wait, in the current scene, the screen door is listed as closed. So the user needs to open it. Then, after opening it, they can go east. But the user's last action was going east from the bedroom, which led to the kitchen. Now, in the kitchen, the screen door is closed. So the next step should be to open the screen door. Then, after that, go east again. But the user needs to check if that's the correct path. Also, the original plan said after opening the screen door, attempt to head east. So maybe the next action is to open the screen door first. Let me check the current state again. The kitchen has a closed screen door east. So the user needs to open it. Then, after opening, go east. But the user's next move should be to open the screen door. So the command would be "open screen door". But the system might require the exact wording. Let me check the previous commands. The user previously used "unlock wooden door" and "open wooden door". So maybe here, the correct command is "open screen door". Then, after that, go east. But the user's next action should be to open the screen door. So the answer is "open screen door".

You scan the room for a set of chairs, and you find a set of chairs. The set of chairs appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You see a bbq. The bbq is normal. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a patio table. The patio table is standard. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

There is an open screen door leading west. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps given in the original instructions. They started by opening the antique trunk, taking the old key, unlocking and opening the wooden door, then going east to the kitchen. They opened the screen door, went east again to the backyard, and then went south to the garden.

In the garden, the current state is that there's a lettuce, a tomato plant, an apple, and a shovel on the floor. The next step according to the original plan was to retrieve the apple from the floor of the garden. The user has already reached the garden, so the next logical action would be to pick up the apple. 

The user's next command should be "take apple from floor" or something similar. But looking at the previous actions, the user has been using commands like "go east", "open screen door", etc. The game's response in the garden mentions the apple is on the floor, so the correct action here is to take the apple. 

The user's previous action was "go south", which led them to the garden. Now, they need to pick up the apple. The next step after that would be to venture north as per the original plan, but first, the apple must be retrieved. So the correct command here is to take the apple from the floor.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the steps in the TextWorld game. They've opened the antique trunk, taken the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, went east to the kitchen, opened the screen door, went east again to the backyard, and then south to the garden. Now, in the garden, they need to retrieve the apple from the floor.

But the user is trying to take the apple from the floor, but the game says they can't see any such thing. Wait, the description of the garden says: "There is a lettuce, a tomato plant, an apple and a shovel on the floor." So the apple is there. Maybe the user is using the wrong command. The correct command should be "take apple from floor" but maybe the game expects "take apple" without specifying the location. However, the game's response says "You can't see any such thing." Hmm, maybe the apple is not visible, but the description says it's on the floor. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check again.

Wait, the user has already tried "take apple from floor" three times, and each time it's rejected. The game's description does mention the apple is on the floor, so maybe the issue is that the command is not properly formatted. Maybe the correct command is just "take apple" without "from floor", but the game's parser might require the preposition. Alternatively, maybe the apple is not in the correct location. But according to the game's description, it's on the floor. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to first look around to confirm the apple's presence. But the game's description already lists the apple as being on the floor. So perhaps the correct command is "take apple from floor", but the game is not recognizing it. Maybe the game expects "take apple" without the "from floor" part. But the user's previous attempts to take it without the "from floor" might not have worked. Wait, the user's previous attempts were to take the apple from the floor, but the game says they can't see it. But according to the game's description, the apple is there. This is confusing. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to first check the floor, but the game's description already lists the apple as being on the floor. So perhaps the correct command is "take apple", and the game's parser is not recognizing it because of the way the command is structured. But the user has tried "take apple from floor" and it's not working. Maybe the game expects "take apple" without the "from floor" part. Let me check the game's previous interactions. The user tried "take apple from floor" and got "You can't see any such thing." But the game's description says the apple is on the floor. Maybe the game is not parsing the command correctly. Alternatively, maybe the apple is not visible, but the description says it's there. 

In this case, the user needs to take the apple, so the correct command should be "take apple". But the user has tried "take apple from floor" and it's not working. Maybe the game expects just "take apple". Let me think. The user's previous action was in the garden, and the game's description says the apple is on the floor. So the correct command should be "take apple from floor", but the game is not accepting it. Maybe the game is expecting "take apple" without the "from floor" part. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to first look around to see the apple. But the game's description already lists the apple as being on the floor. 

Given that the user has tried "take apple from floor" three times and it's not working, maybe the correct command is simply "take apple". Let's try that. So the next action should be "take apple".

The next step in the original plan was to sit the apple on the stove inside the kitchen. The user has the apple in their inventory now (since they picked it up in the garden). So the next logical action is to go to the stove. But how do they get there? The kitchen has a stove, so they need to interact with it. The command would be to 'put apple on stove' or something similar. However, in TextWorld, the exact phrasing might matter. Since the stove is in the kitchen, and they're already in the kitchen, the correct command would be to place the apple on the stove. The previous steps have them in the kitchen, so the next action should be to put the apple on the stove. The user needs to check if they can do that. The correct command here is 'put apple on stove'.
