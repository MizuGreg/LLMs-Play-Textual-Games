I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is how to play! First, it would be great if you could ensure that the chest drawer within the bedroom is open. And then, retrieve the old key from the chest drawer. And then, unlock the wooden door with the old key. And then, ensure that the wooden door within the bedroom is open. And then, make an attempt to go east. And then, open the screen door. After opening the screen door, make an effort to go to the east. Then, take a trip south. And then, retrieve the bell pepper from the floor of the garden. If you can get your hands on the bell pepper, head north. Then, travel west. After that, rest the bell pepper on the stove. Got that? Good!

-= Bedroom =-
You're now in the bedroom. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You can make out a chest drawer. You can see a closed antique trunk. You make out a king-size bed. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Hm. Oh well

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. You make out a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. The stove is ordinary. The stove appears to be empty. You can see a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

If you're wondering why everything seems so ordinary all of a sudden, it's because you've just walked into the backyard. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You can see a set of chairs. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a set of chairs, go to TextWorld. The set of chairs is usual. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You see a bbq. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You swear loudly. You can see a patio table. Now why would someone leave that there? But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.

There is an open screen door leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Backyard, and they need to retrieve the bell pepper from the garden. The next steps mentioned were: after opening the screen door and going east, then take a trip south, retrieve the bell pepper from the floor of the garden, put it on the stove, etc.

Wait, the current location is the Backyard. The user just opened the screen door and went east, but the Backyard's description says there's an open screen door leading west and an unblocked exit to the south. So maybe the next step is to go south from the Backyard. The goal is to get to the garden where the bell pepper is. So the user needs to go south from the Backyard to reach the garden. Then, retrieve the bell pepper from the floor. Then head north, travel west, rest the bell pepper on the stove.

But the user's last action was "go east" in the Backyard, which might not be correct. Wait, the Backyard's exits are west (screen door) and south (unblocked exit). So going east from the Backyard isn't possible. Maybe the user made a mistake here. But according to the previous steps, after opening the screen door in the kitchen, they went east to the Backyard. Now, in the Backyard, the next step should be to go south to the garden. So the correct action here is to go south. The user's next move should be "go south" to reach the garden where the bell pepper is located. Then retrieve it. So the answer should be "go south".

-= Garden =-

There is an unblocked exit to the north.

There is a half of a bag of chips, an apple, a bell pepper and a shovel on the floor.

Okay, the user is stuck in the Garden trying to take the bell pepper. Let me check the game state again. The Garden has a half bag of chips, an apple, a bell pepper, and a shovel on the floor. The user has tried "take bell pepper from floor" multiple times, but it's not working. Wait, maybe the correct command is just "take bell pepper" without specifying the floor? Or perhaps the bell pepper is already in the inventory? Alternatively, maybe the user needs to pick it up directly. Let me think about the possible commands. In TextWorld, sometimes you just say "take [object]" without specifying location if it's in the current room. The user might have tried "take bell pepper from floor" but the game doesn't recognize it because the bell pepper is simply on the floor, so the correct command is "take bell pepper". Let me check the previous interactions. The user tried "take bell pepper from floor" multiple times, but the game says "You can't see any such thing." Wait, but the garden does have a bell pepper on the floor. Maybe the game's parser isn't recognizing "from floor" here. So the correct action is to just take the bell pepper. Let me confirm: the user is in the Garden, and the bell pepper is on the floor. So the correct command should be "take bell pepper". The user might have been using the wrong syntax. So the next action should be "take bell pepper".

Okay, let's see. The user has been moving between rooms, trying to complete tasks. The original goal was to retrieve the bell pepper and put it on the stove. They got the bell pepper in the garden, then went back to the kitchen, but now they're stuck in a loop between the kitchen and bathroom.

Wait, the last action was going south from the bathroom back to the kitchen. The user's score is at 9/18, which seems low. Maybe they missed some steps. Let me check the original instructions again.

The user needed to: retrieve the bell pepper from the garden, then head north, travel west, rest the bell pepper on the stove. But in the current state, they're in the kitchen again. The stove is in the kitchen. So after getting the bell pepper, they should go north to the backyard, then west to the kitchen, then put the bell pepper on the stove.

But the user is going back and forth between kitchen and bathroom, which might be a mistake. The correct path after the garden is to go north to the backyard, then west to the kitchen, then north again to the bathroom? Wait, no. Let me retrace.

After getting the bell pepper in the garden (step 9/10), the next step was to go north to the backyard (step 9/11). Then go west to the kitchen (step 9/12). Then go north to the bathroom (step 9/13). Then go south back to kitchen (step 9/14). Then again north to bathroom (step 9/15), south to kitchen (step 9/16), north to bathroom (step 9/17), south to kitchen (step 9/18). So the user is stuck in a loop between kitchen and bathroom, not progressing further.

The missing step is putting the bell pepper on the stove. The user has the bell pepper in their inventory, so they need to go to the stove in the kitchen and place it there. But they're not moving towards the stove. The stove is in the kitchen, so once in the kitchen, they should "put bell pepper on stove".

But the user's last action was going south to the kitchen again. So the next step should be to put the bell pepper on the stove. However, the user hasn't done that yet. So the correct action now is to "put bell pepper on stove" in the kitchen.
