It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First stop, open the chest drawer. And then, pick up the old key from the chest drawer within the bedroom. After picking up the old key, make it so that the wooden door is unlocked. After that, ensure that the wooden door within the bedroom is open. After that, move east. With that done, open the screen door. And then, go east. Following that, try to move south. Okay, and then, recover the apple from the floor of the garden. If you can get your hands on the apple, head north. That done, try to head west. And then, put the apple on the stove in the kitchen. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Bedroom =-
You find yourself in a bedroom. A typical kind of place. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You see a chest drawer. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can make out a closed antique trunk here. You see a king-size bed. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You swear loudly.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

You've just sauntered into a kitchen.

You make out a closed refrigerator. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. But there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the counter. You see a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a kitchen island! The kitchen island is normal. On the kitchen island you can see a note. Huh, weird.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

The patio table is usual. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

There is an open screen door leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in the Garden area trying to recover the apple. The problem is that the game's response says "You can't see any such thing" when they try to take the apple. But earlier, when they looked around, the description mentioned "a milk, an apple, a lettuce and a shovel on the floor." So the apple is there, but maybe the player isn't using the correct command.

In TextWorld games, commands are usually verbs like "take", "get", "pick up", etc. The user tried "recover apple" which isn't a valid command. Then they tried "take apple from floor", but the game says it's not possible. However, the correct command might just be "take apple" without specifying "from floor" since the apple is on the floor. Alternatively, maybe "pick up apple" is the right verb. But the game's response says "You can't see any such thing," which is confusing because the apple is listed in the description.

Wait, maybe the game is case-sensitive or the command needs to be exact. The user might need to use "take apple" instead of "take apple from floor". Let me check the previous steps. The user was in the Garden, and the description says there's an apple on the floor. So the correct command should be "take apple" or "pick up apple". The user tried "take apple from floor" which might be incorrect because the apple is already on the floor, so the command doesn't need to specify "from floor". 

So the next action should be "take apple" to pick it up. If that doesn't work, maybe "pick up apple". But the user has to try the correct command. The game's response might be a bug, but according to the instructions, the user has to follow the correct commands. So the next step is to try "take apple".
</think>take apple

You pick up the apple from the ground.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

Well, here we are in a bathroom.

You can make out a closed toilet. You can see a bath. You can see a sink. The sink is normal. On the sink you make out a toothbrush.

There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user has been moving between rooms, trying to complete the tasks. The main goal is to recover the apple and put it on the stove in the kitchen. So far, they've picked up the apple in the garden. Now, they need to go north from the kitchen to the bathroom, but that's just a loop. The user is stuck in a cycle between kitchen and bathroom, going back and forth.

The original task after getting the apple was to head north, then west, then put the apple on the stove. But the user is going north from the kitchen, which leads to the bathroom, then back to the kitchen. That's not helpful. Maybe they need to go east from the kitchen instead, but the screen door is open. Wait, in the kitchen, there's an open screen door leading east, which was previously the backyard. But the user was in the backyard, then went south to the garden, then back. Maybe they need to go east from the kitchen to the backyard again, then find the stove?

Wait, the stove is in the kitchen. The user has the apple, so they need to go to the kitchen's stove. But they are currently in the kitchen, so maybe they can just go to the stove. But the stove is described as being in the kitchen, but the user hasn't interacted with it yet. The task was to put the apple on the stove in the kitchen. So once they have the apple, they need to go to the stove and place it there.

But in the current state, the user is in the kitchen, having the apple. So the next step should be to go to the stove. However, the game's description of the kitchen mentions a stove, but the user hasn't used it yet. So the correct action would be to go to the stove, then put the apple there. But the user is currently in the kitchen, so maybe they can just "go to stove" or "go to the stove". Alternatively, the command might be "put apple on stove".

But the user's last action was going north and south repeatedly. They need to stop that loop. Since they are in the kitchen, they should go to the stove. The stove is in the kitchen, so the command would be "go to stove" or "go to the stove". Alternatively, maybe "approach stove" or "go to stove". The game might accept "go to stove" as the command. So the next action should be to go to the stove in the kitchen, then put the apple there.

Okay, the user is stuck in the bathroom, repeatedly trying to go to the stove but getting errors. Let me check the game state. The user has the apple from the garden and is in the bathroom after moving back and forth between kitchen and bathroom. The original goal was to put the apple on the stove in the kitchen. But the user is in the bathroom now. The stove is in the kitchen, so they need to go back to the kitchen. The error messages indicate that "stove" isn't visible here. So the correct step is to go back to the kitchen, then go to the stove. The user was in the bathroom, so the next action should be to go south back to the kitchen. Then, from the kitchen, go to the stove. But the user is currently in the bathroom, so the command should be "go south" to return to the kitchen. Then, in the kitchen, "go to stove" or "approach stove". But the user is in the bathroom, so first go south to the kitchen.

Okay, the user is stuck in the kitchen again, trying to find the stove. They have the apple from the garden and need to put it on the stove. The problem is that the game's description of the kitchen mentions a stove, but the user can't see it. Maybe the stove is hidden or requires a specific action to interact with. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to open the stove first. Let me check the previous steps.

The user was in the kitchen, and the description says: "You see a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though." So the stove is present but maybe it's closed or needs to be opened. The user might need to "open stove" before putting the apple on it. But the command "go to stove" isn't working. Maybe the correct command is "open stove" or "approach stove". Alternatively, the user might need to use the apple in a different way. Wait, the original goal was to put the apple on the stove. So perhaps the stove is a receptacle that can hold the apple. But the game's response says "You can't see any such thing" when trying to go to the stove. Maybe the stove is not visible, so the user needs to look around again. But the user has already looked around. Alternatively, maybe the stove is in a different location. Wait, the kitchen has a stove, but maybe the user needs to interact with it directly. The correct command might be "put apple on stove" without going there first. But the game might require being near the stove. Since the user is in the kitchen, maybe they can just "put apple on stove" directly. Let me try that.
