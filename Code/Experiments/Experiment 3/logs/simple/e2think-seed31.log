You are now playing a life changing game of TextWorld! First stop, open the antique trunk. After pulling open the antique trunk, take the old key from the antique trunk within the bedroom. If you can get your hands on the old key, assure that the wooden door is unlocked with the old key. And then, look and see that the wooden door is ajar. After that, try to go east. Then, try to move south. After that, retrieve the lettuce from the couch. And then, try to head north. Then, place the lettuce on the stove inside the kitchen. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Bedroom =-
You arrive in a bedroom. An ordinary one.

You can see a closed chest drawer in the corner. You see an antique trunk. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a king-size bed. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user has already opened the antique trunk and taken the old key. The next step according to the instructions was to unlock the wooden door with the key. So I need to check if the door is locked. The description mentioned that the door is closed, but after unlocking, it should be ajar. Then they need to go east, move south, get the lettuce from the couch, place it on the stove in the kitchen, and win.

Wait, the current location is the bedroom. The wooden door leads east. So after unlocking it, the user should go east. But first, they need to use the key on the door. The next action should be to unlock the door with the key. Let me confirm the steps again. The user has the key now. The door is closed. So the next step is to unlock it. Then go east, then south, etc. So the next command should be to unlock the door. But how is the door described? The original description said "closed wooden door leading east." So maybe the user needs to use the key to unlock it. So the next action is to unlock the door with the key. Then proceed east. Then move south. Then retrieve the lettuce from the couch. Then go north, place on stove. So the next step is to unlock the door. So the command should be "unlock the wooden door with the old key". But in the game's context, maybe the command is just "use old key on wooden door" or "unlock wooden door". But the user has to input the exact command. Looking back at the previous actions, the user was told to "assure that the wooden door is unlocked with the old key". So the next action is to unlock the door. The correct command here would be "unlock the wooden door" or "use old key on wooden door". But in the game's previous steps, the user was told to "open the antique trunk" and "take the old key". So maybe the next step is to "unlock the wooden door". But the user has the key, so the action is to use the key on the door. So the next command is "unlock the wooden door with the old key". But the game might require a simpler command. Alternatively, since the key is in hand, the user can try to unlock the door. So the next action is "unlock the wooden door".

Okay, let's see. The user tried to go east but the game said they have to open the wooden door first. So the previous action was unlocking the door, which was successful. Now, the door is unlocked, so going east should be possible. Wait, maybe the door was just unlocked, so the user needs to open it again? Or maybe the door is now ajar. The original instruction said after unlocking, the door is ajar. So the next step is to go east. But the game's response says "You have to open the wooden door first." Maybe the door is locked again? Wait, no, the user just unlocked it. Maybe the game is prompting to open it again. Alternatively, maybe the door is closed but unlocked, so the user needs to open it. But the user already unlocked it. Hmm. The correct action here is to go east, but the game is preventing it. So the user needs to open the door. But the door was just unlocked. Maybe the game is using "open" instead of "unlock". Wait, the user used "unlock", but the game says "open". Maybe the correct command is "open the wooden door" instead of "unlock". But the user already unlocked it. Wait, maybe the door is locked and the user needs to open it. But the user just unlocked it. This is confusing. Let me check the previous steps. The user had the key, unlocked the door, and now the game says they have to open it. Maybe the door is locked again. But that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the door is ajar but needs to be opened. Wait, the original instructions said after unlocking, the door is ajar. So the user can go east. But the game is preventing it. Maybe the game is expecting the user to open the door again. So the correct action is to open the door. But the user already unlocked it. Maybe the game is using different verbs. So the next action should be "open the wooden door" even though it was unlocked. Alternatively, the user can go east. But the game says they have to open the door first. So the user needs to open the door again. So the next command is "open the wooden door".

You are in a kitchen. An usual kind of place. You can barely contain your excitement.

You see a refrigerator. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. The counter is standard. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You smell a terrible smell, and follow it to a stove. But the thing is empty. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is ordinary. On the kitchen island you can see a note. Wow! Just like in the movies!

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

Okay, let's recap the steps so far. The player started in the bedroom, opened the antique trunk, took the old key, unlocked the wooden door, opened it, and went east into the kitchen. The current location is the kitchen, and the score is 5/7. The next steps according to the original plan were to move south after going east. But in the kitchen, the player sees a note on the kitchen island. The original goal mentioned retrieving the lettuce from the couch and placing it on the stove. Wait, but the player is in the kitchen now. The couch was in the bedroom, maybe? Or perhaps the couch is in the kitchen? The description says the kitchen has a counter, stove, and a kitchen island. The lettuce was supposed to be retrieved from the couch, which might be in the bedroom. But the player is now in the kitchen. Maybe the next step is to go west back to the bedroom to get the lettuce? Or perhaps the lettuce is already here. Wait, the original instructions said "retrieve the lettuce from the couch" which was in the bedroom. So the player needs to go back to the bedroom, get the lettuce, then go to the kitchen and place it on the stove. But the player is currently in the kitchen. So the next action should be to go west back to the bedroom. But the kitchen has an open wooden door leading west, which connects back to the bedroom. So the next command is "go west" to return to the bedroom, then retrieve the lettuce from the couch. But the player hasn't done that yet. The score is 5/7, so there are still steps left. The original plan was after unlocking the door, go east, then move south, retrieve lettuce from couch, then head north, place on stove. But in the kitchen, the player is now. So maybe after going west to the bedroom, then go south to retrieve the lettuce. But the player is in the kitchen, so the next step is to go west to the bedroom. So the next command is "go west".

Okay, the user is in the bedroom again after going west from the kitchen. The previous action was "go south", but they can't go that way. The current location is the bedroom, and the possible exits are east (open wooden door) and maybe other directions. The original goal was to retrieve the lettuce from the couch and place it on the stove. The couch wasn't mentioned in the bedroom description, but maybe it's in the bedroom. The user needs to find the lettuce. Since they can't go south, perhaps they need to check other areas in the bedroom. The chest drawer is in the corner. Maybe the lettuce is in the chest drawer. So the next action should be to open the chest drawer. Alternatively, the user might need to look around the bedroom for the couch where the lettuce is. But the description says the bed is empty. Maybe the chest drawer has the lettuce. So the command would be "open the closed chest drawer".

Okay, the user is stuck in the bedroom. They tried opening the chest drawer but couldn't find the lettuce. The previous steps were going west to the bedroom, then trying to go south which wasn't possible. Now, after looking around, it's still not working. Maybe the lettuce is somewhere else. Wait, the original plan was to retrieve the lettuce from the couch. But in the bedroom description, there's no mention of a couch. Maybe the couch is in the kitchen? Or perhaps the lettuce is in the antique trunk, but it was empty. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check the kitchen again. But they were in the kitchen earlier. Wait, the user is in the bedroom now. Maybe the correct action is to go east back to the kitchen. Since the eastern door is open, that's possible. Then, in the kitchen, maybe the lettuce is there. But according to the original instructions, the lettuce is on the couch in the bedroom. Hmm. Maybe the user needs to check the kitchen again for the lettuce. So the next action is to go east back to the kitchen.

You are in a kitchen. An usual kind of place. You can barely contain your excitement.

You see a refrigerator. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. The counter is standard. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You smell a terrible smell, and follow it to a stove. But the thing is empty. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is ordinary. On the kitchen island you can see a note. Wow! Just like in the movies!

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

You are in a kitchen. An usual kind of place. You can barely contain your excitement.

You see a refrigerator. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. The counter is standard. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You smell a terrible smell, and follow it to a stove. But the thing is empty. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is ordinary. On the kitchen island you can see a note. Wow! Just like in the movies!

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

You are in a kitchen. An usual kind of place. You can barely contain your excitement.

You see a refrigerator. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. The counter is standard. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You smell a terrible smell, and follow it to a stove. But the thing is empty. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is ordinary. On the kitchen island you can see a note. Wow! Just like in the movies!

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the bathroom and the kitchen. They keep going back and forth between the two rooms. The original goal was to retrieve the lettuce from the couch in the bedroom and place it on the stove in the kitchen. But the user hasn't found the lettuce yet. The chest drawer in the bedroom was empty, and the kitchen doesn't have the lettuce either. The note on the kitchen island might be a clue, but the user hasn't checked it. Maybe the lettuce is in the bathroom? But the bathroom description doesn't mention it. Alternatively, the user might have missed something in the kitchen. The note on the kitchen island could be a hint, but the user hasn't looked closer. The next step should be to check the kitchen island again or look for the lettuce in the bedroom. Since the user is in the kitchen, maybe they should go west back to the bedroom and check the chest drawer again. But the chest drawer was already opened and found empty. Hmm. The user needs to find the lettuce, so maybe the correct action is to go west to the bedroom and check again, or look for the lettuce in the kitchen. But according to the game's description, the lettuce is supposed to be on the couch in the bedroom. The user might need to check the couch in the bedroom. But the bedroom description doesn't mention a couch. Maybe the user needs to look under the counter or in the refrigerator. But the refrigerator is empty. This is confusing. The user needs to find the lettuce, so the next action should be to check the kitchen island again or go back to the bedroom. Since the user is in the kitchen, the next command is to go west to the bedroom.

You arrive in a bedroom. An ordinary one.

You can see a closed chest drawer in the corner. You see an antique trunk. What a letdown! The antique trunk is empty! You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a king-size bed. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open wooden door leading east.

On the kitchen island you can see a note. Wow! Just like in the movies!

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Bathroom =-
You arrive in a bathroom. An usual one.

You make out a toilet. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can make out a closed bath, which looks normal, close by. Hey, want to see a sink? Look over there, a sink. You see a toothbrush on the sink.

There is an unguarded exit to the south.
