I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! First off, assure that the antique trunk within the bedroom is open. And then, take the old key from the antique trunk inside the bedroom. Once you have got the old key, doublecheck that the wooden door is unlocked. And then, open the wooden door. Once you have pulled open the wooden door, attempt to venture east. That done, make sure that the refrigerator is open. Then, recover the lettuce from the refrigerator in the kitchen. If you can get your hands on the lettuce, place the lettuce on the stove in the kitchen. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Bedroom =-
You've just walked into a bedroom.

You can see a chest drawer. You can see a closed antique trunk. What's that over there? It looks like it's a king-size bed. The king-size bed is ordinary. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user has already opened the antique trunk and taken the old key. The next step according to the instructions was to double-check that the wooden door is unlocked. So I need to check if the door is unlocked. But wait, the user has the old key, so maybe using it on the door would unlock it. Let me make sure. The current location is the bedroom, and the wooden door leading east is closed. The user needs to unlock it. So the next action should be to unlock the wooden door with the old key. But the game might require using the key on the door. Alternatively, maybe the door is locked, so using the key on it would unlock it. Let me check the previous steps again. The user has the key, so the next step is to unlock the door. Then open it and go east. So the next command should be to unlock the wooden door. But the exact command might be "unlock wooden door" or "use old key on wooden door". But in TextWorld, the correct command might be "unlock wooden door" since the key is already in the inventory. Wait, the user took the old key from the trunk, so they have it. So the next step is to unlock the door with the key. So the command would be "unlock wooden door". But maybe the door is locked, so using the key on it would unlock it. Let me confirm. The user needs to unlock the door, then open it. So the next action is to unlock the wooden door.

Okay, the user has successfully opened the wooden door leading east. The next step according to the original instructions was to venture east. So after opening the door, the next action should be to go east. Let me check the previous steps again. The user is in the bedroom, just opened the door, so now they need to move east to the next room. The command should be "go east". That's the next logical step. Let me make sure there's no other action needed before moving. The instructions said once the door is open, attempt to venture east. So "go east" is the correct command here.

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. A typical one. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

You see a refrigerator. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. The counter is usual. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Okay, the user tried to go east but the screen door is closed. The next step is to open the screen door. The command should be "open screen door". Let me check the previous steps. The user is in the kitchen, and the screen door leading east is closed. So the correct action is to open it first before going through.

The user's score is 5/7, so they're on the right track. The next action is to open the screen door.

You find yourself in a standard kind of place. That is to say, you're in a backyard.

You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a set of chairs. You wonder idly who left that here. The set of chairs is typical. But there isn't a thing on it. You can see a bbq. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a patio table. The patio table is usual. However, the patio table, like an empty patio table, has nothing on it. Hm. Oh well

There is an open screen door leading west. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

Okay, the user is in the backyard. The previous steps involved opening the screen door and going east, which led here. The goal is to get the lettuce from the refrigerator in the kitchen and place it on the stove. But the user is now in the backyard. The instructions mentioned going east from the kitchen, but maybe there's a mistake in the path. Wait, the user had to go east from the kitchen, but the screen door was closed and needed to be opened. Now, in the backyard, the exit to the south is mentioned as unguarded. But the original plan was to go to the kitchen, get the lettuce, and then place it on the stove. Maybe the user is lost in the maze of rooms. The next step should be to go back west to the kitchen. The screen door is open, so going west would return to the kitchen. Then, the user needs to check the refrigerator. But the user's current location is the backyard, so the correct action is to go west back to the kitchen. The command should be "go west".

Okay, the user opened the refrigerator and found a bell pepper and lettuce. The next step is to take the lettuce. So the command should be "take lettuce from refrigerator". Let me check the previous steps. The user needs to recover the lettuce from the fridge, so taking it now would proceed. Then, after taking the lettuce, the next step is to place it on the stove. But first, take the lettuce. The command is straightforward.

Okay, the user tried to "place lettuce on stove" but got an error. Maybe the correct command is "put lettuce on stove" or "place the lettuce on the stove". Let me check the game's possible commands. Since "place" isn't recognized, perhaps "put" is the correct verb. So the next action should be "put lettuce on stove". That should work.
