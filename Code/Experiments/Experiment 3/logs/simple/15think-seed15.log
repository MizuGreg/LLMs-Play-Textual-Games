It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First stop, open the chest drawer. And then, pick up the old key from the chest drawer within the bedroom. After picking up the old key, make it so that the wooden door is unlocked. After that, ensure that the wooden door within the bedroom is open. After that, move east. With that done, open the screen door. And then, go east. Following that, try to move south. Okay, and then, recover the apple from the floor of the garden. If you can get your hands on the apple, head north. That done, try to head west. And then, put the apple on the stove in the kitchen. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Bedroom =-
You find yourself in a bedroom. A typical kind of place. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You see a chest drawer. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can make out a closed antique trunk here. You see a king-size bed. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You swear loudly.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

-= Kitchen =-
You've just sauntered into a kitchen.

You make out a closed refrigerator. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. But there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the counter. You see a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a kitchen island! The kitchen island is normal. On the kitchen island you can see a note. Huh, weird.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in the Garden scene. They need to recover the apple from the floor. The previous attempts to "take apple from floor" didn't work. The game message says there's an apple on the floor, but the player can't see it. Maybe the issue is that the apple is hidden or not directly visible.

Wait, the user tried "recover apple" but that's not a valid command. Then they tried "take apple from floor," which also didn't work. The game says "You can't see any such thing." So maybe the apple is not in the floor but somewhere else? Let me check the description again.

In the Garden scene, the message says: "There is a milk, an apple, a lettuce and a shovel on the floor." So the apple is indeed on the floor. But the player can't see it. Maybe the command should be "take apple" without specifying the floor, or perhaps "pick up apple." Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "take apple from floor," but the game isn't recognizing it. Or maybe the apple is hidden under something else.

Alternatively, maybe the player needs to look around again, but the previous "look around" didn't help. Wait, the user tried "look around" and got "You can't see any such thing." That's confusing because the game says the apple is on the floor. Maybe there's a typo or a miscommunication. The correct command might be "take apple" or "pick up apple." Let me check the available commands. The user is in the Garden, and the possible actions are moving directions or interacting with objects. Since the apple is on the floor, the correct command should be "take apple" or "pick up apple." But the game might require the exact phrasing. Maybe "take apple from floor" is correct, but the game is not recognizing it. Alternatively, maybe the apple is not visible, so the player needs to look again. But the user tried that already. Hmm. The next step would be to try "take apple" without specifying the floor, or maybe "pick up apple." Let's try that.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in the Garden area, trying to find the apple. The problem is that they can't see the apple even though it's mentioned in the description. The previous attempts to "take apple from floor" failed because the game doesn't recognize that command. The correct verb here should be "take" instead of "take apple from floor". The user might be trying to use a command structure that's not valid. The game's response indicates that the apple is on the floor, so the right action is to "take apple from floor", but the system is rejecting it. Wait, but the user tried that and got "You can't see any such thing." Maybe the game expects a different command, like "take apple" without specifying the location. Alternatively, maybe the apple is not visible, so the player needs to look around again. But the user has already looked around multiple times. Hmm, perhaps the correct command is just "take apple" without the "from floor" part. Let me check the previous interactions. The user tried "take apple from floor" and it failed. The game's message says there's an apple on the floor. So maybe the correct command is "take apple" alone. But the user might not realize that. Alternatively, maybe the game requires the player to first look around to see the apple. But the user has already looked around and the game says "You can't see any such thing." That's confusing. Wait, the game's description says "There is a milk, an apple, a lettuce and a shovel on the floor." So the apple is there. The user needs to take it. The correct command should be "take apple" without the "from floor" part. The previous attempt was "take apple from floor", which the game doesn't recognize. So the correct command is just "take apple". Let me confirm. The user's last action was "take apple from floor", which failed. So the next step is to try "take apple".

There is an open screen door leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

-= Kitchen =-
You've just sauntered into a kitchen.

You make out a closed refrigerator. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. But there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the counter. You see a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a kitchen island! The kitchen island is normal. On the kitchen island you can see a note. Huh, weird.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

You find yourself in a bedroom. A typical kind of place. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You see a chest drawer. Hmmm... what else, what else? Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You can make out a closed antique trunk here. You see a king-size bed. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You swear loudly.

There is an open wooden door leading east.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game where they have to follow a series of steps to reach the goal. The current score is 9 out of 25, and they've been stuck in a loop between the Kitchen and Bathroom, going back and forth between them.

First, I need to recall the original task. The user had to: open the chest drawer, pick up the old key, unlock and open the wooden door in the bedroom, move east, open the screen door, go east again, move south to recover the apple from the garden, then head north, west, and put the apple on the stove in the kitchen. Finally, they'd win.

Looking at the current state, the user has the apple from the garden. They went back to the kitchen, but they're stuck in a loop between the kitchen and bathroom. The last action was going north to the bathroom, then south back to the kitchen. They need to proceed with the next steps after getting the apple.

The next step after recovering the apple was to head north, then west, and put the apple on the stove. But in the current state, they're in the kitchen again. The stove is in the kitchen, so maybe they need to go west from the kitchen to the bedroom, then proceed further. However, the user has already unlocked and opened the door in the bedroom earlier. Wait, but in the current state, they're in the kitchen, and the previous steps might have been redundant.

Wait, the user has the apple. The next step was to go north from the garden, which led them to the backyard, then west to the kitchen. Then they got stuck in the bathroom loop. So maybe they need to go from the kitchen west to the bedroom, then proceed further. But the bedroom's east door is open, so maybe they can go back east to the kitchen, but that's not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe they need to go north from the kitchen to the bathroom, but that's not helpful. The key is to get the apple to the stove. The stove is in the kitchen. So perhaps they need to go west from the kitchen to the bedroom, but the bedroom's west door is closed? Wait, in the bedroom description, there's an open wooden door leading east, but the west door might be closed. Wait, earlier in the bedroom, after opening the door, the user went east to the kitchen. So the bedroom's west door might be closed, so they can't go back. So maybe they need to go from the kitchen east to the backyard, then south to the garden, but they already have the apple.

Wait, the user has the apple in their inventory. The next step was to head north from the garden, which they did, but got stuck. Maybe they need to go from the kitchen west to the bedroom, then east again to the kitchen, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe they need to go from the kitchen north to the bathroom, then south back to the kitchen, but that's just looping.

Wait, the original plan was after getting the apple, go north, then west. But in the current state, they're in the kitchen. Maybe they need to go west from the kitchen to the bedroom, then proceed east again? But the bedroom's east door is open. Wait, but the user is in the kitchen, so going west would take them back to the bedroom. Then from the bedroom, they can go east again to the kitchen, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe they need to go from the kitchen east to the backyard, then south to the garden, but they already have the apple.

Wait, the user has the apple. The next step was to put it on the stove in the kitchen. So they need to be in the kitchen, have the apple, and then put it on the stove. But in the current state, they're in the kitchen, but they're stuck in a loop. So maybe they need to just go to the stove and put the apple there. But the stove is in the kitchen. So the user needs to go to the stove, which is in the kitchen. But the user is already in the kitchen. So perhaps the next step is to go to the stove and put the apple there.

But in the game's current state, the user is in the kitchen, and the stove is present. So the correct action would be to go to the stove and put the apple on it. However, the user hasn't done that yet. So the next step is to go to the stove and put the apple there. But how to do that? The user has the apple, so they need to interact with the stove.

But the game's commands are limited to movement and actions. The user might need to "put apple on stove" or something similar. However, in the previous steps, the user had to "take apple from floor" which was successful once. Now, they need to put it on the stove. So the correct action would be to "put apple on stove".

But in the game's context, the user is in the kitchen, and the stove is there. So the next step is to put the apple on the stove. Therefore, the correct command is "put apple on stove".
