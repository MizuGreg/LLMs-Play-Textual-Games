Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First step, look and see that the chest drawer within the bedroom is opened. And then, recover the old key from the chest drawer inside the bedroom. And then, unlock the wooden door. Then, open the wooden door within the bedroom. And then, go east. That done, open the refrigerator within the kitchen. After that, recover the apple from the refrigerator. Then, put the apple on the stove. Got that? Good!

-= Bedroom =-
You are in a bedroom. A normal kind of place.

You can make out a closed chest drawer in the corner. Oh, great. Here's an antique trunk. You can see a king-size bed. However, the king-size bed, like an empty king-size bed, has nothing on it.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me see. The user has been following the steps to open the chest drawer, get the key, unlock and open the door, then go east. Now they're in the kitchen, right? The next step was to open the refrigerator. So the next action should be "open refrigerator" to proceed. I need to make sure that's the correct command here. The user's score is at 4/5, so they're on the right track. The next step is definitely opening the fridge in the kitchen.

You can't see any such thing.

-= Kitchen =-
You've stumbled into a normal room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be normal. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the kitchen. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You can make out a closed refrigerator. You can make out a counter. You shudder, but continue examining the counter. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. You can make out a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? The stove appears to be empty. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a kitchen island. The kitchen island is usual. On the kitchen island you make out a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the south.
