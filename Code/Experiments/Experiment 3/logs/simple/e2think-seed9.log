Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First, it would be good if you could open the chest drawer within the bedroom. And then, take the old key from the chest drawer within the bedroom. With the old key, unlock the wooden door. Then, ensure that the wooden door within the bedroom is open. After that, make an effort to head east. If you can accomplish that, open the refrigerator inside the kitchen. After that, recover the lettuce from the refrigerator in the kitchen. After that, rest the lettuce on the stove. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Bedroom =-
You're now in the bedroom. Let's see what's in here.

You can make out a closed chest drawer. You see an antique trunk. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You make out a king-size bed. The king-size bed is normal. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user has already opened the chest drawer and taken the old key. The next step was to unlock the wooden door with the key. So the next action should be to unlock the door. But wait, in TextWorld, sometimes you need to use the key on the door. So maybe the command is "unlock wooden door with old key". But the user might have to specify the key. Let me check the previous steps. The user took the old key from the chest drawer. So now, they need to use that key to unlock the door. The door is closed and leads east. So the correct command would be to unlock the door with the key. But the system might require a specific phrasing. Let me think. The previous actions were "open chest drawer" and "take old key from chest drawer". Now, the next step is to unlock the door. So the next command should be "unlock wooden door with old key". But maybe the game expects "use old key on wooden door" or something similar. However, the user's previous actions used "take" and "open", so maybe "unlock" is the right verb here. Let me confirm. The task said to "unlock the wooden door" using the old key. So the correct command is "unlock wooden door with old key". But the system might require just "unlock wooden door" if the key is in the inventory. Alternatively, maybe "use old key on wooden door". But the user has the key, so the correct action is to unlock the door with the key. So the next command should be "unlock wooden door with old key".

Okay, the user tried to go east but couldn't because the door was locked. They already unlocked the door with the key, so maybe the door is now open. Wait, the previous message said "You unlock wooden door." So the door should be open now. But the system says "You have to open the wooden door first." That's confusing. Maybe the door is still closed even though they tried to unlock it. Or maybe the action "unlock" doesn't equate to the door being open. Maybe the correct action is to "open wooden door" instead of unlock. But the task said to "unlock the wooden door." Hmm. The user's next action should be to go east again, but the system is preventing it. So perhaps the door is still closed, and they need to open it. But they already unlocked it. Maybe the game's logic is that unlocking doesn't automatically open it. So maybe they need to "open wooden door" after unlocking. But the user's previous action was unlocking, so maybe the next step is to go east. But the system is saying they need to open the door first. Maybe the correct command is "open wooden door" even though they unlocked it. Alternatively, maybe the door is locked and needs to be opened. But the task said to unlock it. This is a bit conflicting. The user's next action should be to go east, but the system is blocking. So perhaps the correct command is "go east" again, even though the system says to open the door. But according to the task, after unlocking, they should "ensure that the wooden door within the bedroom is open." So maybe they need to open it again. But the user already unlocked it. Maybe the game requires the "open" action. So the next command should be "open wooden door".

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. An usual one.

A closed refrigerator is here. You scan the room for a counter, and you find a counter. The counter is ordinary. But the thing is empty. You move on, clearly infuriated by your TextWorld experience. You see a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You see a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island, so there's that.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Okay, the user is in the kitchen now. The task was to open the refrigerator, take the lettuce, put it on the stove, and win. So next steps: open the refrigerator. The user has to use the command "open refrigerator" to access it. Then take the lettuce from inside. Then go back to the stove, which is in the kitchen. But the user has to make sure the refrigerator is open. So the next action should be opening the refrigerator.

Okay, the user has taken the lettuce from the refrigerator. The next step is to rest the lettuce on the stove. So they need to go to the stove and place the lettuce there. The command would be "put lettuce on stove". But first, they might need to check if the stove is accessible. Since the stove is mentioned in the kitchen description, they can directly interact with it. So the next action is to put the lettuce on the stove.
