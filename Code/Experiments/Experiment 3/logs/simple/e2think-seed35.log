Welcome to TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First thing I need you to do is to open the chest drawer within the bedroom. And then, retrieve the old key from the chest drawer within the bedroom. With the old key, insert the old key into the wooden door's lock to unlock it. After that, ensure that the wooden door is open. Then, try to go east. After that, open the refrigerator. After that, recover the tomato plant from the refrigerator. If you can get your hands on the tomato plant, sit the tomato plant on the stove in the kitchen. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Bedroom =-
You find yourself in a bedroom. An usual kind of place.

A closed chest drawer is in the room. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an antique trunk. Huh, weird. What's that over there? It looks like it's a king-size bed. The king-size bed is normal. But the thing is empty.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing a text-based game where they need to follow a series of steps to complete a task. The current situation is in the bedroom. They've already opened the chest drawer and retrieved the old key. But the system said "That's not a verb I recognise" when they tried to retrieve the key. Wait, maybe the correct action isn't "retrieve" but something else like "take" or "get"?

The user is confused because they thought "retrieve" was the right command. But in text adventures, sometimes the verbs are more specific. Maybe the correct action is "take old key from chest drawer" or "get old key". But the user's previous action was "retrieve old key from chest drawer", which the system didn't recognize. So perhaps the correct verb is "take" instead of "retrieve".

Looking back at the game's possible commands, the user might need to use "take" to pick up the key. So the next step should be to take the old key from the chest drawer. Then, after getting the key, they need to unlock the wooden door. But first, they have to make sure the key is in their inventory.

Wait, the user's last action was "retrieve old key from chest drawer", which the system rejected. So the correct action might be "take old key from chest drawer". Let me check the game's possible commands again. The user needs to use the correct verb. Since "retrieve" wasn't accepted, maybe "take" is the correct verb here.

So the next action should be "take old key from chest drawer". Then, after that, they can proceed to unlock the door. But the user's next step is to insert the key into the lock. So after taking the key, they need to go to the wooden door, unlock it, then go east, open the fridge, get the tomato plant, put it on the stove, etc.

But the user's current step is to retrieve the key. Since "retrieve" didn't work, they need to try "take" instead. So the correct next action is "take old key from chest drawer".

Okay, let's see. The user has successfully unlocked the wooden door. The next step according to the original task was to ensure the wooden door is open. Since they just unlocked it, the door should now be open. Then they need to go east. So the next action should be "go east".

But wait, the user is in the bedroom, and after unlocking the door, they need to check if the door is open. But in the game's context, unlocking the door would mean it's now open. So the next step is to move east. The command would be "go east". Then, after going east, they need to open the refrigerator. So the next action after going east would be "open refrigerator". But the user's current step is after unlocking the door, so the immediate next action is to go east.

Okay, let me retrace the steps. The user started in the bedroom, opened the chest drawer, retrieved the old key, unlocked the wooden door, but the game mentioned they had to open the door first. Wait, maybe there's a confusion between unlocking and opening. The user tried to go east before opening the door, which was incorrect. So after unlocking, they need to open the door again? Or maybe "unlock" and "open" are different actions here.

Wait, the game's feedback said "You have to open the wooden door first." So even though they unlocked it, they need to open it. Maybe the door was locked, so unlocking is different from opening. So after unlocking, they need to open it. But the user tried to go east before opening, which was wrong. So the correct next step is to open the door again. But the user just tried to go east, which was incorrect. Then the game said they had to open the door first. So the next action should be "open wooden door" again. But the user already unlocked it. Hmm, maybe the game considers unlocking as part of opening. Wait, the user previously tried to go east without opening the door, which was wrong. So after unlocking, they need to open the door. But the user already unlocked it. Maybe the game requires them to open the door again. So the next action is "open wooden door". Then, after that, they can go east. So the correct next command is "open wooden door".

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a refrigerator. You make out a counter. The counter is standard. The counter appears to be empty. You make out a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove! oh well. You can see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is normal. On the kitchen island you can see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the kitchen now. The task was to open the refrigerator after going east. So the next step is to open the refrigerator. The user just came from the bedroom, so they need to check if the refrigerator is in the kitchen. The description mentions a refrigerator, so the correct action is "open refrigerator". That should be the next command.
