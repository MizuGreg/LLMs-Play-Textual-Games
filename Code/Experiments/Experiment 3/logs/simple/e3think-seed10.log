You are now playing a life changing round of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First off, make absolutely sure that the antique trunk is ajar. Then, retrieve the old key from the antique trunk. And then, make absolutely sure that the wooden door in the bedroom is unlocked. And then, look and see that the wooden door is open. And then, make an attempt to head east. And then, open the refrigerator inside the kitchen. If you have opened the refrigerator, pick up the lettuce from the refrigerator. And then, sit the lettuce on the stove inside the kitchen. Alright, thanks!

-= Bedroom =-
You are in a bedroom. A normal kind of place. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You can see a chest drawer. You can see a closed antique trunk, which looks usual, right there by you. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a king-size bed. The king-size bed is normal. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in the text adventure game. The goal seems to involve opening the wooden door in the bedroom, which requires using the old key. But the user tried to go east first, which wasn't allowed because the door was closed. Then they tried to open the door, but it needed unlocking with the key. Next, they tried to get the old key from the antique trunk, but the trunk was closed. The system message says the trunk is ajar, so maybe the user didn't open it yet.

Wait, the initial instruction said to make sure the antique trunk is ajar. The user might have missed that step. So the first thing is to open the trunk. Then retrieve the key. Then unlock the door. Then open the door. Then proceed east. Then go to the kitchen, open the fridge, get lettuce, put it on the stove.

But in the current state, the user tried to get the key from the trunk but couldn't because it was closed. So the correct action now is to open the antique trunk first. The user didn't do that yet. So the next step should be to open the trunk. Then get the key. Then unlock the door. Then open the door. Then go east. Then proceed with the kitchen tasks.

So the user's last action was trying to get the key from the trunk, but the trunk was closed. The system message says the trunk is ajar, but maybe the user didn't open it. Wait, the initial instruction said to make sure the trunk is ajar. So maybe the user needs to open it first. So the correct next action is to open the antique trunk. Then retrieve the key. Then unlock the door. Then open the door. Then go east. Then proceed to the kitchen.

So the user's current step is at 0/3, which might be the third step in the sequence. The user tried to get the key but couldn't because the trunk was closed. So the next action should be to open the trunk. Then get the key. Then unlock the door. Then open the door. Then go east. Then proceed to the kitchen.

Therefore, the correct next action is to open the antique trunk.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps correctly. They first made sure the antique trunk was open, retrieved the key, unlocked the wooden door. Now the next step according to the initial instructions was to "look and see that the wooden door is open." But the system message says the door is unlocked. So maybe the next step is to open the door. Wait, the user just unlocked it, so they need to open it. Then proceed east. Then go to the kitchen, open the fridge, get lettuce, put it on the stove.

So the current step is after unlocking the door. The next action should be to open the wooden door. Then go east. Then proceed to the kitchen. So the next command is "open wooden door".

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to play the text adventure game. They've followed the steps correctly so far: opened the antique trunk, got the key, unlocked the door, and opened the door. Now they need to go east. But the system is rejecting "go east" as not a valid action.

Wait, maybe the correct command is "move east" instead of "go east"? Or perhaps "walk east"? But the game's previous actions used "go east" when the user tried it earlier. The system said "That's not a verb I recognise." So maybe the correct verb is "move" instead of "go"? Let me check the previous interactions.

Looking back, the user first tried "go east", which was rejected. Then the assistant suggested "open the wooden door", which worked. Then "unlock wooden door with old key" worked. Now, after opening the door, the user needs to move east. The system is not accepting "go east". Maybe the correct command is "move east" or "walk east". Alternatively, maybe the game expects "east" as a direction without the verb. But in text adventures, usually, "go east" is the correct command. However, the system is rejecting it. So perhaps the correct action is "move east". Let me try that. Alternatively, maybe the game uses "walk east". But since the user previously tried "go east" and it was rejected, maybe the correct command is "move east". So the next action should be "move east".

Okay, let's see. The user is in the bedroom, tried to go east but the command wasn't accepted. Then they tried "look east" but saw nothing. The original goal was to proceed east after opening the door. Maybe the correct action is "go east" again, but the system rejected it before. Alternatively, maybe the game expects "move east" or "walk east". But the user tried "look east" and it didn't help. Since the previous attempt to "go east" was rejected, perhaps the correct command is "move east". Let me check the possible commands. In text adventures, "go east" is standard, but maybe the game uses "move" as the verb. So the next action should be "move east".

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. An ordinary one.

You make out a refrigerator, so there's that. What's that over there? It looks like it's a counter. The counter is normal. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What's the point of an empty counter? You can see a stove. The stove is normal. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You make out a kitchen island. On the kitchen island you see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Okay, let's see. The user has been through the bedroom, opened the door, and now they're in the kitchen. The original goal was to open the refrigerator, get lettuce, and put it on the stove. So the next steps would be to open the refrigerator. The user is in the kitchen, so the next action should be to open the refrigerator. The score increased, so they're on the right track.
