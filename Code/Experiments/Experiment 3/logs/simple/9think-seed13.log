I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is how to play! First, it would be great if you could ensure that the chest drawer within the bedroom is open. And then, retrieve the old key from the chest drawer. And then, unlock the wooden door with the old key. And then, ensure that the wooden door within the bedroom is open. And then, make an attempt to go east. And then, open the screen door. After opening the screen door, make an effort to go to the east. Then, take a trip south. And then, retrieve the bell pepper from the floor of the garden. If you can get your hands on the bell pepper, head north. Then, travel west. After that, rest the bell pepper on the stove. Got that? Good!

-= Bedroom =-
You're now in the bedroom. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You can make out a chest drawer. You can see a closed antique trunk. You make out a king-size bed. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Hm. Oh well

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a refrigerator. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a counter. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. You make out a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. The stove is ordinary. The stove appears to be empty. You can see a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

If you're wondering why everything seems so ordinary all of a sudden, it's because you've just walked into the backyard. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You can see a set of chairs. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a set of chairs, go to TextWorld. The set of chairs is usual. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You see a bbq. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You swear loudly. You can see a patio table. Now why would someone leave that there? But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.

There is an open screen door leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in the Backyard, and they need to retrieve the bell pepper from the garden. The next steps mentioned were: after opening the screen door and going east, then take a trip south, retrieve the bell pepper from the floor of the garden, put it on the stove, etc.

Wait, the current location is the Backyard. The user just opened the screen door and went east, but the Backyard's description says there's an open screen door leading west and an unblocked exit to the south. So maybe the next step is to go south from the Backyard. The goal is to get to the garden where the bell pepper is. So the user needs to go south from the Backyard to reach the garden. Then, retrieve the bell pepper from the floor. Then head north, travel west, rest the bell pepper on the stove.

But the user's last action was "go east" in the Backyard, which might not be correct. Wait, the Backyard's exits are west (screen door) and south (unblocked exit). So going east from the Backyard isn't possible. Maybe the user made a mistake here. But according to the previous steps, after opening the screen door in the kitchen, they went east to the Backyard. Now, in the Backyard, the next step should be to go south to the garden. So the correct action here is to go south. The user's next move should be "go south" to reach the garden where the bell pepper is located. Then retrieve it. So the answer should be "go south".

Okay, the user is stuck in the game because they can't find the bell pepper. Let me check the previous steps. The user was told to retrieve the bell pepper from the floor of the garden. But when they tried to take it, the game said it wasn't there. Wait, maybe the user didn't actually pick it up yet. Let me look at the current state.

In the Garden scene, the items on the floor are a half bag of chips, an apple, a bell pepper, and a shovel. The user hasn't taken any of these yet. The previous action was trying to take the bell pepper, but the game said "You can't see any such thing." That's confusing because the bell pepper is listed as being on the floor. Maybe the user needs to check again or there's a typo in the item name. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use a different verb, like "get" instead of "take." But the game's response says "can't see any such thing," so perhaps the item isn't visible. Wait, maybe the user didn't look carefully. Let me check the description again. The garden has the bell pepper on the floor. So the user should be able to take it. Maybe the game is having a glitch, but the user is supposed to proceed. Since the user is at 8/9, they need to get the bell pepper, then put it on the stove. But they can't find it. Maybe the correct command is "take bell pepper from floor" even though the game says it's not there. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to look again. But the game's response says "can't see any such thing," so perhaps the item is not there. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in the previous steps. Let me check the history. The user was in the Garden after going south from the Backyard. The items are there. The user tried to take the bell pepper multiple times, but the game says it's not there. Maybe the correct command is "get bell pepper" instead of "take." But the user tried "take" and it didn't work. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use "pick up" or another verb. However, the game's response says "can't see any such thing," which is confusing. Since the user is stuck, maybe the next step is to try a different action, like looking around again, but the game doesn't have a "look" command. Alternatively, the user might need to proceed to the next step even if they can't find the bell pepper. But the original goal requires getting the bell pepper. So maybe the user needs to try again, perhaps the game is having a bug, but the user has to keep trying. The next action after failing multiple times would be to try "take bell pepper from floor" again, even though the game says it's not there. Alternatively, maybe the user should try "get bell pepper" without specifying the floor. But according to the game's previous responses, the correct command is "take bell pepper from floor." Since the user is at 8/9, they need to proceed. The next step is to take the bell pepper, even if the game says it's not there. Maybe the game is malfunctioning, but the user has to continue. So the next action is "take bell pepper from floor."

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to take the bell pepper from the floor in the garden. They've tried "take bell pepper from floor" multiple times, but it's not working. The game says "You can't see any such thing." So maybe the bell pepper isn't actually on the floor? Wait, the description of the garden says there's a half of a bag of chips, an apple, a bell pepper, and a shovel on the floor. So the bell pepper is there. But when the user tries to take it, it's not recognized. Maybe the correct command is just "take bell pepper" without specifying the floor? Or maybe the game expects a different phrasing. Alternatively, perhaps the user needs to first look around to see the bell pepper, but the game already mentions it's on the floor. Hmm. The user has already tried taking it from the floor, but maybe the correct verb is "take" instead of "retrieve"? Wait, earlier the user tried "retrieve bell pepper from floor" which didn't work, then switched to "take". But the game says "You can't see any such thing." Maybe the bell pepper is not visible, even though it's there. Or maybe the game is broken. But the user is supposed to follow the instructions. The original goal was to retrieve the bell pepper, so maybe the correct command is just "take bell pepper" without specifying the floor. Let me check the previous steps. The user was in the garden, and the description lists the bell pepper on the floor. So the correct command should be "take bell pepper" or "take bell pepper from floor". But the game is not recognizing it. Maybe the game expects "take bell pepper" alone. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use "get" instead of "take". But the game's previous interactions used "take". Wait, in the garden, the user is told to "retrieve the bell pepper from the floor of the garden." So maybe the correct command is "take bell pepper from floor" but the game is not recognizing it. Alternatively, maybe the bell pepper is not there. But the description says it is. Maybe the user needs to use a different verb. Alternatively, maybe the game is malfunctioning. But the user is supposed to keep trying. Since the user has tried "take bell pepper from floor" multiple times and it's not working, maybe the correct command is just "take bell pepper". Let me try that. The user's last action was "take bell pepper from floor", which didn't work. So maybe the correct command is "take bell pepper" without the "from floor" part. Let me check the game's previous responses. When the user tried "take bell pepper from floor", the game said "You can't see any such thing." But the description says the bell pepper is on the floor. Maybe the game is not updating the inventory correctly. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use "get" instead of "take". But the game's previous interaction used "take". Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to look around again. But the game already mentions the bell pepper is on the floor. I think the correct command here is "take bell pepper" without specifying the floor. Let's try that.

-= Backyard =-
If you're wondering why everything seems so ordinary all of a sudden, it's because you've just walked into the backyard. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You can see a set of chairs. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a set of chairs, go to TextWorld. The set of chairs is usual. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You see a bbq. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You swear loudly. You can see a patio table. Now why would someone leave that there? But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.

There is an open screen door leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

You've just sauntered into a kitchen.

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a refrigerator. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a counter. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. You make out a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. The stove is ordinary. The stove appears to be empty. You can see a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in a loop between the Kitchen and Bathroom, going back and forth. The original goal was to retrieve the bell pepper and then rest it on the stove. But the user has been moving around without completing that task.

Wait, the user was in the Garden earlier, where they picked up the bell pepper. Then they went back to the Backyard, then Kitchen, then Bathroom, and back. They haven't mentioned putting the bell pepper on the stove yet. Maybe the next step is to go back to the Kitchen where the stove is located and place the bell pepper there.

But the current location is the Kitchen again. The user has the bell pepper in their inventory, so they need to go to the stove and put it there. The stove is in the Kitchen, so the next action should be to go to the stove and rest the bell pepper. However, the user might not know the exact command for putting an item on the stove. The correct command would be "put bell pepper on stove" or "rest bell pepper on stove" as mentioned in the original instructions. But in the game's context, the correct verb might be "put" or "rest". Since the user previously used "rest" when instructed, maybe that's the right term. But the game's response when trying to put it on the stove might vary. However, the user hasn't tried that yet. So the next action should be to go to the stove and then put the bell pepper there. But since the user is already in the Kitchen, the next step is to "put bell pepper on stove".
