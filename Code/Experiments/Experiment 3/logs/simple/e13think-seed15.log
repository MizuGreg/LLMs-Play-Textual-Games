It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First stop, open the chest drawer. And then, pick up the old key from the chest drawer within the bedroom. After picking up the old key, make it so that the wooden door is unlocked. After that, ensure that the wooden door within the bedroom is open. After that, move east. With that done, open the screen door. And then, go east. Following that, try to move south. Okay, and then, recover the apple from the floor of the garden. If you can get your hands on the apple, head north. That done, try to head west. And then, put the apple on the stove in the kitchen. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Bedroom =-
You find yourself in a bedroom. A typical kind of place. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You see a chest drawer. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can make out a closed antique trunk here. You see a king-size bed. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You swear loudly.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

You've just sauntered into a kitchen.

You make out a closed refrigerator. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. But there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the counter. You see a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a kitchen island! The kitchen island is normal. On the kitchen island you can see a note. Huh, weird.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

The patio table is usual. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

There is an open screen door leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in the game and can't find the apple in the garden. They tried "recover apple" and "take apple from floor", but both failed. The garden has a milk, apple, lettuce, and shovel on the floor. The user needs to pick up the apple.

Wait, maybe the correct command is "take apple" without specifying "from floor"? Or maybe "get apple"? The game might have specific verbs. Since "take apple from floor" didn't work, perhaps just "take apple" is needed. Alternatively, maybe "pick up apple".

But the user tried "take apple from floor" and it didn't work. The game message says "You can't see any such thing." So maybe the apple is not visible, but it's there. Maybe the correct command is just "take apple" or "get apple". Let me check the previous steps.

In the garden description, it says "There is a milk, an apple, a lettuce and a shovel on the floor." So the apple is on the floor. The user needs to take it. The correct command might be "take apple" or "pick up apple". Since "take apple from floor" didn't work, maybe just "take apple".

Alternatively, maybe the game expects "take apple" without the "from floor" part. Let me try that. The user's last action was "take apple from floor", which failed. So the next step should be "take apple".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to put the apple on the stove in the kitchen, but they can't see it. They've been in the kitchen, then went back to the bedroom. The apple is in their inventory since they picked it up in the garden.

Wait, maybe the stove is in the kitchen, but when they were in the kitchen earlier, they saw a stove. But when they tried to put the apple on it, the game said they couldn't see it. Maybe the stove is closed or not accessible. Alternatively, maybe they need to open the stove first. Or perhaps the apple is not on the stove but on the counter or somewhere else.

Wait, in the kitchen description, there's a stove and a kitchen island. The user has the apple. Maybe they need to go to the stove location. But the user is currently in the bedroom. They need to go back to the kitchen. Let me check the previous steps.

The user was in the kitchen, then went west to the bedroom. Now they're in the bedroom. To get back to the kitchen, they can go east. Then, once in the kitchen, try to put the apple on the stove. But the game says they can't see the stove. Maybe the stove is closed, so they need to open it first. Or maybe the apple is already on the stove, but the game isn't recognizing it.

Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "put apple on stove" without specifying the kitchen, but the game expects the location. Since the user is in the bedroom, they need to go back to the kitchen first. So the next step should be to go east to the kitchen, then try putting the apple on the stove. But the user is currently in the bedroom, so the next command should be "go east" to return to the kitchen. Then, once in the kitchen, "put apple on stove".
