You are now playing a fast paced episode of TextWorld! First, it would be fantastic if you could make absolutely sure that the chest drawer is ajar. Then, take the old key from the chest drawer. After that, assure that the wooden door is unlocked. And then, make absolutely sure that the wooden door within the bedroom is opened. And then, make an attempt to head east. If you can get around to doing that, look and see that the refrigerator within the kitchen is open. Once you have opened the refrigerator, pick up the milk from the refrigerator inside the kitchen. If you can get your hands on the milk, place the milk on the stove inside the kitchen. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Bedroom =-
You are in a bedroom. A normal kind of place.

You see a closed chest drawer. You can make out a closed antique trunk right there by you. You can see a king-size bed. The king-size bed is normal. But there isn't a thing on it.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

<think>
Okay, let me see. The user has been following the steps to open the chest drawer, take the key, unlock the wooden door, and now they've reached the fourth step. The next step according to the original instructions was to make sure the wooden door within the bedroom is opened. Wait, the door was already unlocked, but maybe it needs to be opened? Or maybe "unlocked" and "opened" are different actions here.

Looking at the previous steps: The user unlocked the wooden door with the key. The next step in the original plan was to "make absolutely sure that the wooden door within the bedroom is opened." So maybe after unlocking, they need to open it. But in the game's context, sometimes unlocking and opening are separate. So the user might need to open the door after unlocking it. Let me check the previous messages.

In the initial description, the wooden door is closed and leads east. The user unlocked it, but maybe the door is still closed. So the next action should be to open the door. Then, after that, they need to head east. So the next command should be "open wooden door" to ensure it's opened. Then go east. Let me confirm the current state. The user is in the bedroom, and the wooden door is unlocked but maybe not opened. So the next step is to open it. Then proceed east. So the correct next action is to open the door.

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.

You make out a closed refrigerator. You see a counter. But there isn't a thing on it. Sometimes, just sometimes, TextWorld can just be the worst. You can see a stove. The stove is usual. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You move on, clearly angry about TextWorld. You can see a kitchen island. You wonder idly who left that here. You see a note on the kitchen island. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps given in the initial instructions. They started in the bedroom, opened the chest drawer, took the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, then went east to the kitchen. Now, in the kitchen, they opened the refrigerator and found milk and lettuce.

The next step according to the original plan was to pick up the milk from the refrigerator. So the user should now take the milk. After that, they need to place the milk on the stove. Then, once that's done, they win. 

Looking at the current state, the user has already opened the refrigerator, so the immediate next action is to take the milk. The response should be "take milk from refrigerator". Then, after getting the milk, they would go to the stove and put it there. The user hasn't done that yet, so the next command after taking the milk would be "put milk on stove". But the current step is to take the milk. So the correct next action is to take the milk.
