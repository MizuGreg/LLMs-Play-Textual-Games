I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First off, ensure that the antique trunk within the bedroom is open. After that, recover the old key from the antique trunk. After that, make it so that the wooden door in the bedroom is unlocked with the old key. And then, make absolutely sure that the wooden door inside the bedroom is ajar. After opening the wooden door, go east. Then, doublecheck that the screen door is wide open. And then, attempt to travel east. And then, try to travel south. With that done, lift the milk from the floor of the garden. After stealing the milk, head north. And then, attempt to travel west. With that done, rest the milk on the stove. That's it!

-= Bedroom =-
I am sorry to announce that you are now in the bedroom. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a chest drawer. You scan the room for an antique trunk, and you find an antique trunk. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to a king-size bed. The king-size bed is standard. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. You think about smashing the king-size bed to bits, throwing the bits in the dump, etc, until you get bored.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game where they have to follow a series of steps to complete a task. The current situation is in the Garden, where they need to lift the milk from the floor. But when they tried to take the milk, the game said they can't see any such thing. Hmm, maybe the milk isn't visible at first, or maybe it's hidden somewhere else.

Looking back at the previous steps, the user had to go east from the Kitchen, which led them to the Backyard, then south to the Garden. In the Garden, the description mentions that there's a milk, a half bag of chips, lettuce, and a shovel on the floor. Wait, but when the user tried to take the milk, it said they can't see any such thing. That's confusing because the description explicitly says the milk is there. Maybe there's a typo or a misunderstanding in the game's response. Alternatively, maybe the milk is in a different location than what's described. Or perhaps the user needs to interact with another object first to see the milk.

Alternatively, maybe the game's response is a mistake. The user might need to check again. But according to the game's last message, the milk is on the floor. So why can't they take it? Maybe the correct command is "take milk" instead of "take milk from floor"? Or maybe the game expects a different verb. But the user tried "take milk from floor" and it didn't work. Maybe the correct action is just "take milk" without specifying the floor, since the milk is already on the floor. Let me check the previous steps again.

In the Garden description, it says: "There is a milk, a half of a bag of chips, a lettuce and a shovel on the floor." So the milk is on the floor. The user's previous attempt was "take milk from floor", which the game rejected. Maybe the correct command is simply "take milk", as the game might automatically assume it's on the floor. Alternatively, maybe the game requires the user to pick it up directly. Let me think about possible commands. The user might need to use "take milk" without specifying the location, since the game's description already states it's on the floor. So the next action should be "take milk".

<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game where they have to follow a series of steps to complete a task. The current challenge is to rest the milk on the stove. The user has tried several commands like "put milk on stove" multiple times, but each time it's rejected because the action isn't possible.

First, I need to recall the game's environment. The user is in the Backyard, which has a patio table, chairs, a BBQ, and an open screen door west and an exit south. The milk was picked up from the Garden, which is north of the Backyard. The stove is in the Kitchen, which is west of the Backyard. But the user is currently in the Backyard, so the stove isn't visible here. The problem is that the user has the milk, but they can't put it on the stove because they're not in the right location.

The user's last action was trying to "put milk on stove" again, which didn't work. The error message says "You can't see any such thing," meaning the stove isn't in the current room. So the correct approach would be to go back to the Kitchen where the stove is located. The user needs to go west through the open screen door to reach the Kitchen again. Once there, they can put the milk on the stove. 

But the user hasn't tried moving west yet. The previous steps had them go east from the Kitchen to the Backyard, so going west from the Backyard would return them to the Kitchen. Then, in the Kitchen, the stove should be visible, allowing them to put the milk on it. The key here is to navigate back to the correct room where the stove is located before attempting the action.
