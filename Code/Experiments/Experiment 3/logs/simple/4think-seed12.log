I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First off, ensure that the antique trunk within the bedroom is open. After that, recover the old key from the antique trunk. After that, make it so that the wooden door in the bedroom is unlocked with the old key. And then, make absolutely sure that the wooden door inside the bedroom is ajar. After opening the wooden door, go east. Then, doublecheck that the screen door is wide open. And then, attempt to travel east. And then, try to travel south. With that done, lift the milk from the floor of the garden. After stealing the milk, head north. And then, attempt to travel west. With that done, rest the milk on the stove. That's it!

-= Bedroom =-
I am sorry to announce that you are now in the bedroom. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a chest drawer. You scan the room for an antique trunk, and you find an antique trunk. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to a king-size bed. The king-size bed is standard. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. You think about smashing the king-size bed to bits, throwing the bits in the dump, etc, until you get bored.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me try to figure out what the user needs here. They're in a text-based game called TextWorld, and their task is to follow a series of steps to complete a quest. So far, they've opened an antique trunk, taken an old key, unlocked a wooden door, and tried to make the door ajar. But the system responded that "ajar wooden door" isn't a recognized verb.

Hmm, the user is probably trying to make the door open fully. The previous step was unlocking the door, so maybe the next step is to open it. But the game might use specific commands. The user tried "ajar," which isn't working. Maybe the correct command is "open wooden door" instead. Let me check the previous interactions. The user had to "unlock" the door, so maybe "open" is the next action. Alternatively, maybe "push" or "pull" if the door is locked but unlocked. Wait, the user already unlocked it, so perhaps just opening it. The system might expect "open" as the command. Let me make sure. The user's last action was "ajar wooden door," which failed. So the next step should be to try "open wooden door." That makes sense. The user needs to open the door after unlocking it. So the correct command is "open wooden door."

Of every kitchen you could have sauntered into, you had to walk into an ordinary one. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You can see a closed refrigerator in the room. You can make out a counter. The counter is usual. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. You scan the room, seeing a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. You can see a kitchen island. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? On the kitchen island you can see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they have to follow a series of steps to complete a task. The current scenario is in the Kitchen after opening the screen door. The original goal was to go through various rooms, open doors, collect items like the old key and milk, and perform specific actions.

So far, the user has opened the antique trunk, taken the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door in the bedroom, then went east to the kitchen. They opened the screen door here. Now, the next step according to the original instructions was to "doublecheck that the screen door is wide open" and then "attempt to travel east." The user just opened the screen door, so the next logical step would be to check if it's open, which they already did, and then try to go east again. However, the user might need to confirm the screen door is open before proceeding. But since the game already allows moving east after opening it, the next action would be to go east again. But the user might have to make sure that the screen door is indeed open. However, the game's response after opening the screen door says the screen door is open, so the next step is to go east. But the user's previous action was going east, which might have been blocked until the screen door was open. So the correct next step is to go east again. But the user has to make sure they are following the exact steps given. The original instructions said after opening the screen door, attempt to travel east. So the next command should be "go east" again. However, the user might have to check if they can go east. But according to the game's current state, after opening the screen door, the user can go east. So the next action is "go east".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in the TextWorld game. They've successfully opened the antique trunk, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door, opened it, and moved east to the kitchen. Then they tried going east again, opened the screen door, and moved to the backyard. Now they're in the garden, where the goal is to lift the milk from the floor.

The user tried "take milk from floor" but got a "You can't see any such thing" response. Wait, the garden description says there's a milk, a half bag of chips, lettuce, and a shovel on the floor. So the milk is there. Maybe the correct command is just "take milk" without specifying "from floor" since the milk is on the floor by default. Or maybe the game expects "take milk" without the preposition. Let me check the previous steps. In the garden, the user is supposed to lift the milk. The correct command would be "take milk" because the milk is on the floor, so the game might automatically recognize it as being on the floor. The user tried "take milk from floor" but got an error, so maybe the correct command is just "take milk". Let me confirm the game's expected syntax. In TextWorld, usually, you just say "take milk" if it's in the room. Since the milk is on the floor, the command should be "take milk". The user's previous attempt included "from floor", which might not be necessary. So the next action should be "take milk".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in this text-based game. They started in the bedroom, opened the antique trunk, took the key, unlocked the door, opened it, went east to the kitchen, then east again to the backyard, south to the garden, picked up the milk, went north back to the backyard, west to the kitchen, north to the bathroom. Now they're in the bathroom and the next step is to rest the milk on the stove.

Wait, the original task said after stealing the milk, head north, then attempt to travel west, then rest the milk on the stove. So the user has the milk in their inventory now. They were in the kitchen after going west from the backyard. Then they went north to the bathroom. Now they need to go back to the kitchen, maybe? Because the stove is in the kitchen. So the next step would be to go south from the bathroom back to the kitchen, then find the stove and put the milk there. But the current location is the bathroom, so the command would be 'go south' to return to the kitchen. Then, once in the kitchen, they can go to the stove and rest the milk. But the user's last action was 'go north' to the bathroom, so the next command should be 'go south' to return to the kitchen. Then, in the kitchen, they can put the milk on the stove. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the correct next step is to go south from the bathroom back to the kitchen.
