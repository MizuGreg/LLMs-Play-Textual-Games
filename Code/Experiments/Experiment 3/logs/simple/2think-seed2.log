You are now playing a exciting game of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First stop, assure that the chest drawer in the bedroom is wide open. And then, pick up the old key from the chest drawer inside the bedroom. Then, check that the wooden door is unlocked with the old key. After unlocking the wooden door, assure that the wooden door is wide open. After that, head east. Then, ensure that the screen door in the kitchen is open. Then, make an attempt to move east. With that accomplished, make an attempt to head south. Then, pick-up the lettuce from the floor of the garden. Then, travel north. Then, try to take a trip west. Then, rest the lettuce on the stove inside the kitchen. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Bedroom =-
You arrive in a bedroom. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You make out a chest drawer. What's that over there? It looks like it's an antique trunk. Were you looking for a king-size bed? Because look over there, it's a king-size bed. The king-size bed is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me see. The user has already opened the chest drawer and picked up the old key. The next step according to the task was to check that the wooden door is unlocked with the old key. So now, they need to use the key to unlock the door.

Wait, the current location is the bedroom. The wooden door leading east is closed. The user has the old key, so they should try to unlock the door with it. The command would be to unlock the door with the key. But in the game's context, maybe the action is to use the key on the door. So the next action should be to unlock the wooden door with the old key. Then, after unlocking, they need to make sure the door is wide open. So after unlocking, they might need to open it further. But the exact commands depend on the game's possible actions. Since the user has the key, the next step is to use it on the door. So the correct command here is "unlock wooden door with old key".

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps given in the task. So far, they've opened the chest drawer, picked up the old key, unlocked the wooden door, and opened it. The next step according to the original instructions was to "head east." The user hasn't done that yet.

The current location is the bedroom, and after opening the wooden door, the next logical step would be to move east. The user's next action should be to go east. The response should just be the command "go east" without any extra text. I need to make sure that's the correct next step based on the task description. Let me double-check the original steps: after opening the door, they need to head east, then check the screen door in the kitchen, etc. So yes, "go east" is the next correct action.

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.

You see a closed refrigerator. What's that over there? It looks like it's a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is ordinary. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. What's the point of an empty counter? You can see a stove. The stove is usual. The stove appears to be empty. You see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is standard. On the kitchen island you make out a note. Hmmm... what else, what else?

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? Oh, great. Here's a bbq. The bbq appears to be empty. Hm. Oh well Look over there! a patio table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the patio table.

There is an open screen door leading west. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game where they have to follow a series of steps to complete tasks. The current scenario is in the Backyard. The user has already opened the screen door and went east, leading them to the Backyard. Now, they need to proceed with the next steps as per the original task.

The original task mentioned after unlocking the wooden door and opening it, they should head east. Then, ensure the screen door in the kitchen is open, which they did. Then, try to move east again. But in the current state, they're in the Backyard. The next step according to the original plan was to travel north after some actions. Wait, let me check the original instructions again.

Original task steps: After unlocking and opening the wooden door, head east. Then ensure screen door in kitchen is open (which they did), then attempt to move east. Then attempt to head south. Then pick up lettuce in garden, travel north, west, rest lettuce on stove in kitchen.

Wait, the user is now in the Backyard. The next step after going east from the kitchen (which was the screen door) led them to the Backyard. Now, they need to follow the next steps. The original plan after heading east from the kitchen was to attempt to move east again? Or maybe after the screen door was opened, they tried to go east from the kitchen, which led to the Backyard. Now, the next step was to attempt to head south. But in the Backyard, the user can go south. So maybe the next action is to go south from the Backyard. But the user's last action was going east to the Backyard, and now they need to try moving south. However, the user's current location is the Backyard, and the next step in the original task was after heading east (from kitchen to backyard), then attempt to move east again? Or maybe after the screen door was opened, they tried to move east (which took them to backyard), then attempt to head south. So the next step would be to go south from the Backyard. But the user is in the Backyard now, and the next step is to try moving south. However, the Backyard has an open screen door leading west and a path south. So the user should try going south. But the user's last action was going east to the Backyard, and now they need to attempt to head south. So the next command should be 'go south'. But the user's current location is Backyard, and the next step in the original task was after moving east (from kitchen to backyard), then attempt to move east again? Wait, the original task said: "After that, make an attempt to move east. Then, make an attempt to head south." So after heading east (from kitchen to backyard), then attempt to move east again? But in the Backyard, moving east might not be possible. Wait, the Backyard's description says there's an open screen door leading west, and you can go south. So maybe the next step is to go south from the Backyard. But the original task says after heading east (from kitchen to backyard), then attempt to move east again. But in the Backyard, there's no east direction. So perhaps the user is supposed to go south from the Backyard. But according to the original plan, after heading east (to backyard), then attempt to move east again. But that might not be possible. Maybe the user needs to go south from the Backyard. However, the user's current location is Backyard, and the next step in the original task is to attempt to head south. So the next action should be 'go south'. But the user's last action was 'go east' to get to the Backyard. Now, they need to attempt to head south. So the next command is 'go south'.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps given in the original task. They started in the bedroom, opened the chest drawer, picked up the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, then went east to the kitchen. They opened the screen door, went east again to the backyard, then south to the garden. In the garden, they picked up the lettuce.

Now, the next step according to the original task was to travel north from the garden. The user's last action was picking up the lettuce, so the next command should be to go north. The score is at 9/11, so they need to continue with the steps: after picking up the lettuce, they should travel north, then try to take a trip west, then rest the lettuce on the stove in the kitchen. But the current prompt says to only output the next action. Since the user is in the garden, the immediate next step is to go north as per the task. So the correct command is "go north".

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps given in the original task. They started in the bedroom, opened the chest drawer, picked up the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, then went east to the kitchen. They opened the screen door, went east again to the backyard, then south to the garden where they picked up the lettuce. Now they're back in the garden, and the next step according to the original plan was to travel north after picking up the lettuce. The user just did that, going north from the garden back to the backyard. Now they're at the garden again, and the next step in the task was to "rest the lettuce on the stove inside the kitchen." 

Wait, the current location is the garden. The user needs to get the lettuce to the kitchen. So after picking up the lettuce in the garden, they went north to the backyard, but now they're back in the garden. Maybe they need to go back to the kitchen. Let me check the previous steps. The last action was "go north" from the garden, which took them back to the backyard. Now they're in the garden again. Wait, no, the last step was "go north" from the garden, which would take them to the backyard. But the current location shown is the garden again. Maybe there's a mistake in the steps. Alternatively, perhaps the user needs to go from the garden back to the kitchen. 

The original task said: after picking up the lettuce in the garden, travel north, then try to take a trip west, then rest the lettuce on the stove in the kitchen. So after picking up the lettuce in the garden, the next steps are to go north (which would take them to the backyard), then west (maybe to the kitchen?), then rest the lettuce on the stove. But the user is currently in the garden again. Wait, maybe after going north from the garden, they are in the backyard, then need to go west to the kitchen. But the user's last action was "go north" from the garden, which led them to the backyard. Now, the current location is the backyard. But the prompt shows them back in the garden. Maybe there's a confusion in the steps. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go from the garden back to the kitchen. The garden is connected to the backyard (north) and the kitchen is connected to the backyard (west). So after picking up the lettuce in the garden, they need to go north to the backyard, then west to the kitchen. Then, rest the lettuce on the stove. So the next action should be "go north" from the garden to the backyard, then "go west" to the kitchen. But the user is currently in the garden, so the next step is to go north. However, the user just did that, and the system is showing them back in the garden. Maybe there's a loop here. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go from the garden to the kitchen directly. But according to the map, the garden is connected to the backyard (north), and the kitchen is connected to the backyard (west). So the correct path is garden -> backyard -> kitchen. Therefore, the next action after picking up the lettuce in the garden is to go north to the backyard, then west to the kitchen. The user has already done "go north" from the garden, which took them to the backyard. Now, they need to go west from the backyard to the kitchen. But the current prompt shows them in the garden again. Maybe there's a mistake in the system's response. 

But according to the last message, the user is in the garden again, and the next step is to rest the lettuce on the stove in the kitchen. So the user needs to get from the garden to the kitchen. The correct path is garden -> backyard (north) -> kitchen (west). So the next action should be "go north" again to reach the backyard, then "go west" to the kitchen. But the user is already in the garden, so the next step is to go north. However, the system's last message shows them in the garden again after "go north". That might be a bug, but the user needs to proceed as per the original plan. 

Therefore, the next action should be to go north from the garden to the backyard, then west to the kitchen. But since the user is in the garden, the immediate next step is "go north". However, the user has already done that, and the system is showing them back in the garden. Maybe the user needs to go west from the backyard. But the current location is the garden.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in this text-based game. They've already completed several tasks: opened the chest drawer, picked up the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, went east to the kitchen, opened the screen door, went east again to the backyard, then south to the garden where they picked up the lettuce. They then went north back to the backyard, but trying to go west didn't work. Now they're back in the backyard again.

The next step in the original goal was to "rest the lettuce on the stove inside the kitchen." So the user needs to get the lettuce from the garden back to the kitchen. But right now, they're in the backyard. The garden is north of the backyard, and the kitchen is east of the backyard via the screen door. Wait, earlier they went east from the kitchen through the screen door to the backyard. So maybe the path is: backyard (current location) → kitchen (east) → stove.

But the user is in the backyard. The screen door is open west from the kitchen, but they're in the backyard. Wait, no: the screen door leads east from the kitchen to the backyard. So to get back to the kitchen, they need to go west from the backyard. But earlier, when they tried to go west from the garden (which is north of the backyard), they couldn't. But now they're in the backyard. Wait, the backyard's screen door is leading west, which would be back to the kitchen. Wait, maybe the directions are confusing. Let me check the previous steps.

In the Garden, the user went north to Backyard. In the Backyard, the screen door leads west. So going west from Backyard would take them back to the kitchen. But earlier, when they were in the Garden, trying to go west was blocked. But now, in the Backyard, the screen door is open west. So the user can go west from Backyard to Kitchen. Then, in the Kitchen, they can rest the lettuce on the stove.

So the next action should be to go west from the Backyard to the Kitchen, then rest the lettuce on the stove. But the user is currently in the Backyard. The previous action was "go north" which brought them back to the Backyard. Now, they need to go west to the Kitchen. But the user's last input was "go north" which led them back to the Backyard. Then the system responded with the Backyard description again. So the next step is to go west from the Backyard to the Kitchen. Then, in the Kitchen, they can rest the lettuce on the stove. So the correct next command is "go west".

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.

You see a closed refrigerator. What's that over there? It looks like it's a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is ordinary. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. What's the point of an empty counter? You can see a stove. The stove is usual. The stove appears to be empty. You see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is standard. On the kitchen island you make out a note. Hmmm... what else, what else?

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

That's not a verb I recognise.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user tried to "rest lettuce on stove" but the game said that's not a recognized verb. So I need to figure out the correct command here.

First, the task was to rest the lettuce on the stove inside the kitchen. The user has the lettuce picked up, so they're in the kitchen. The correct action would be to put the lettuce on the stove. But the game doesn't recognize "rest" as a verb here. Maybe the correct command is "put lettuce on stove" or "place lettuce on stove".

Looking at previous interactions, the user used commands like "pick up lettuce" and "open screen door". The game responds to standard verbs. So "put" might be the right verb here. Let me check the previous commands again. The user said "pick up lettuce" which worked. So "put lettuce on stove" might be the correct command. Alternatively, maybe "place" is the verb. But "put" is more common. Let me try "put lettuce on stove".
