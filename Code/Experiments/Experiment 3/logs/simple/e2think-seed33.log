Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, you could, like, doublecheck that the antique trunk is open. And then, retrieve the old key from the antique trunk. After that, make sure that the wooden door in the bedroom is unlocked. Then, open the wooden door. After that, make an attempt to move east. And then, make it so that the refrigerator in the kitchen is ajar. And then, take the bell pepper from the refrigerator. Then, place the bell pepper on the stove. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Bedroom =-
Well, here we are in a bedroom.

You can see a closed chest drawer in the room. You see an antique trunk. You scan the room, seeing a king-size bed. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The king-size bed is standard. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps given. First, they opened the antique trunk and retrieved the old key. Now, the next step according to the original instructions was to make sure the wooden door in the bedroom is unlocked. So, the next action should be to unlock the door.

Wait, the user has already taken the key from the trunk. The next step in the task was to unlock the wooden door. So, the correct command here would be to unlock the door. But how do you do that in the game? The key might be needed to unlock it. Since the user has the key, they can use it to unlock the door. So the next action should be to unlock the wooden door. Let me check the previous steps again.

Yes, the user has the key now. The next step is to unlock the door. So the command should be "unlock wooden door". But in the game's context, maybe it's "unlock the wooden door" or "unlock door". The exact phrasing might matter. The user has to use the key to unlock it. So the correct action is to unlock the door with the key. Therefore, the next command is "unlock wooden door".

Okay, let's see. The user has already opened the antique trunk, taken the key, unlocked the wooden door, and opened it. The next step in the original instructions was to attempt to move east. So after opening the door, the next action should be to go east. The user is in the bedroom, and the door leads east. So the command should be "go east".

Wait, the previous action was opening the wooden door, which was east. So now, the player is outside the bedroom, maybe in another room. The next step is to move east from there. But the user's next action should be "go east" to proceed. The score is 4/5, so they need to do one more step. The original task also included making the refrigerator in the kitchen ajar and taking the bell pepper, then placing it on the stove. But the current steps are about the bedroom and the door. So the next immediate action is to move east. Then, after that, they would need to handle the kitchen tasks. But according to the user's instructions, after moving east, they need to make the refrigerator ajar. But the current step is to move east. So the next command is "go east".

-= Kitchen =-
Well, here we are in a kitchen. Let's see what's in here.

You make out a refrigerator. You see a counter. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You can make out a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You make out a kitchen island. The kitchen island is typical. On the kitchen island you can make out a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

Okay, the user tried to say "make refrigerator ajar" but the system said that's not a recognized verb. So I need to figure out the correct command. In text adventures, common verbs are like "open", "close", "use", "take", etc. Since the refrigerator is a object, maybe the correct action is "open refrigerator" or "open the refrigerator". The user probably meant to open it. Let me check the previous commands. The user had to open the antique trunk, unlock the door, open the door, and now they need to open the refrigerator. So the correct command should be "open refrigerator". The error was using "make ajar" which isn't a standard verb here. So the next action is to open the refrigerator.

Okay, the user has taken the bell pepper from the refrigerator. The next step according to the original instructions was to place the bell pepper on the stove. So the current action should be to put the bell pepper on the stove. The command would be "put bell pepper on stove". Let me check if that's the correct verb. In text adventures, "put" is a common verb for placing items. So the next command is "put bell pepper on stove".
