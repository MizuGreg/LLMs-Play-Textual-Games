It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First step, doublecheck that the antique trunk in the bedroom is wide open. After that, pick up the old key from the antique trunk. After that, make it so that the wooden door inside the bedroom is unlocked with the old key. And then, ensure that the wooden door is open. Then, move east. Then, try to head south. Then, pick up the milk from the couch. Then, make an effort to travel north. Then, put the milk on the stove. That's it!

-= Bedroom =-
I never took you for the sort of person who would show up in a bedroom, but I guess I was wrong.

You can make out a closed chest drawer. You can make out a closed antique trunk. Hey, want to see a king-size bed? Look over there, a king-size bed. The king-size bed is usual. The king-size bed appears to be empty. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps in the TextWorld game. They started by checking the antique trunk in the bedroom, which was closed. Then they opened it and found an old key. They took the key, and now they're at step 2/4.

The next step according to the original task is to unlock the wooden door inside the bedroom with the old key. So the next action should be to unlock the door. But how do you do that in the game? The user has the key, so they need to use it on the door. The command would likely be something like "unlock wooden door" or "use old key on wooden door". But the game's commands might be more straightforward. Since the door is closed and the key is in hand, the correct command is probably "unlock wooden door".

Wait, the user has to make sure the door is unlocked and then open it. So first, unlock it with the key, then open it. The current step is to unlock the door. So the next action is to unlock the wooden door with the old key. The correct command would be "unlock wooden door" or "use old key on wooden door". But in the game's context, maybe just "unlock wooden door" is sufficient. Let me check the previous actions. The user opened the trunk, took the key. Now they need to unlock the door. So the next command is "unlock wooden door".

You arrive in a kitchen.

You see a refrigerator. You make out a counter. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You can see a stove. The stove is ordinary. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. This always happens! Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an unguarded exit to the north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Okay, let me recap the steps I've taken so far to make sure I'm on the right track. The original goal was to explore the world, follow specific steps, and eventually reach the end. Let's break down what's been done:

1. **Bedroom**: Checked the antique trunk, opened it, took the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door leading east. Score is now 4/6. Then moved east to the Kitchen. Score increased to 5/7.

Next steps according to the original task were:
- After opening the wooden door in the bedroom, move east (which I did, arriving in the kitchen).
- Then try to head south. Wait, the user mentioned after moving east, the next step was to try heading south. But in the current location (Kitchen), the exits are east (screen door), west (open wooden door back to bedroom), north (unguarded exit), and south (exit). So, the next logical step would be to go south from the kitchen. However, the user's instruction said after moving east, try to head south. So, the next action should be 'go south' from the kitchen.

But let me check the current location again. The user is in the Kitchen. The exits are east, west, north, and south. The original task said after moving east (from bedroom to kitchen), try to head south. So, the next step is to go south. Then, after that, the next steps were to pick up the milk from the couch, but wait, the couch is in the bedroom, right? Wait, the original task said: "Then, pick up the milk from the couch." But in the current setup, the kitchen is the next location. Wait, maybe there's a mistake here. Let me check the original task again.

Original task steps:
1. Check antique trunk in bedroom is open.
2. Pick up old key from trunk.
3. Unlock wooden door in bedroom with key.
4. Open wooden door.
5. Move east.
6. Try to head south.
7. Pick up milk from couch.
8. Travel north.
9. Put milk on stove.

Wait, but after moving east to the kitchen, the next step is to try heading south. So from the kitchen, go south. But where is the couch? The couch was mentioned in the bedroom description. So maybe after going south from the kitchen, the next location is the bedroom again? But the bedroom's door to the east is open, but the user is in the kitchen. Wait, maybe the south exit from the kitchen leads back to the bedroom? Or perhaps another room?

Wait, the current location is the Kitchen. The exits are:
- East: screen door
- West: open wooden door (back to bedroom)
- North: unguarded exit
- South: exit

So, if the user goes south from the kitchen, they might end up in another room. But according to the original task, after moving east (to kitchen), the next step is to try heading south. So the next action is 'go south' from the kitchen. Then, after that, the next step is to pick up the milk from the couch. But where is the couch? The couch was in the bedroom. So perhaps after going south, the user returns to the bedroom, where the couch is located. But in the bedroom description, there's a king-size bed, a closed chest drawer, a closed antique trunk, and a closed wooden door. The couch isn't mentioned. Wait, maybe the couch is in the kitchen? But the kitchen description doesn't mention a couch. Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, the original task says "pick up the milk from the couch." So the couch must be in a room. The user is in the kitchen now. The original task steps after moving east (to kitchen) are to try heading south. So the next action is 'go south' from the kitchen. Let's assume that going south from the kitchen leads to another room, perhaps the bedroom again? But the bedroom's west door is open. Alternatively, maybe the south exit leads to a different room. However, based on the current information, the user is in the kitchen, and the next step is to go south. So the correct action here is 'go south' to proceed with the task.

-= Living Room =-
You find yourself in a living room. A normal one.

Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a couch. On the couch you can make out a milk. You make out a low table. On the low table you make out a remote. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You see a tv. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps given in the original task. They started in the bedroom, opened the antique trunk, took the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, then moved east to the kitchen. From there, they went south to the living room, picked up the milk, and went north back to the kitchen.

Now, the current location is the kitchen again, with the score at 7/10. The next step according to the original instructions was to "put the milk on the stove." The user has the milk in their inventory since they just took it from the couch. The stove is in the kitchen, and the task is to place the milk there. 

Looking at the kitchen description, the stove is mentioned as ordinary but empty. The user needs to interact with the stove to put the milk on it. The correct command here would be to "put milk on stove." However, in some text adventures, you might need to first pick up the milk from the counter or ensure it's in hand. But since the user just took the milk, the next logical step is to place it on the stove. 

I should check if there's any obstacle. The stove is described as having nothing on it, so putting the milk there should be possible. The command should be straightforward. The user's next action should be to put the milk on the stove to complete the task.
