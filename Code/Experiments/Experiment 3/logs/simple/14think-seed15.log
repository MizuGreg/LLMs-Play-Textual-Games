It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First stop, open the chest drawer. And then, pick up the old key from the chest drawer within the bedroom. After picking up the old key, make it so that the wooden door is unlocked. After that, ensure that the wooden door within the bedroom is open. After that, move east. With that done, open the screen door. And then, go east. Following that, try to move south. Okay, and then, recover the apple from the floor of the garden. If you can get your hands on the apple, head north. That done, try to head west. And then, put the apple on the stove in the kitchen. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Bedroom =-
You find yourself in a bedroom. A typical kind of place. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You see a chest drawer. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can make out a closed antique trunk here. You see a king-size bed. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You swear loudly.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

You make out a closed refrigerator. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. But there isn't a thing on it.

Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a kitchen island! The kitchen island is normal. On the kitchen island you can see a note. Huh, weird.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in the Garden area trying to recover the apple. The problem is that the game's response says "You can't see any such thing" when they try to take the apple. But earlier, when they looked around, the description mentioned "a milk, an apple, a lettuce and a shovel on the floor." So the apple is there, but maybe the player isn't using the correct command.

In TextWorld games, commands are usually verbs like "take", "get", "pick up", etc. The user tried "recover apple" which isn't a valid command. Then they tried "take apple from floor", but the game says it's not possible. However, the correct command might just be "take apple" without specifying "from floor" since the apple is on the floor. Alternatively, maybe "pick up apple" is the right verb. But the game's response says "You can't see any such thing," which is confusing because the apple is listed in the description.

Wait, maybe the game is case-sensitive or the command needs to be exact. The user might need to use "take apple" instead of "take apple from floor". Let me check the previous steps. The user was in the Garden, and the description says there's an apple on the floor. So the correct command should be "take apple" or "pick up apple". The user tried "take apple from floor" which might be incorrect because the apple is already on the floor, so the command doesn't need to specify "from floor". 

So the next action should be "take apple" to pick it up. If that doesn't work, maybe "pick up apple". But the user has to try the correct command. The game's response might be a bug, but according to the instructions, the user has to follow the correct commands. So the next step is to try "take apple".
</think>take apple

You pick up the apple from the ground.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to complete a series of tasks in this TextWorld game. They've already done most of the steps: opened the chest drawer, picked up the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, moved east, opened the screen door, went east again, moved south to the garden, recovered the apple, and then went back west to the kitchen and then to the bedroom.

Now, the final task is to put the apple on the stove in the kitchen. But in the current location, which is the bedroom, there's no stove mentioned. The user tried to put the apple on the stove but couldn't because they're in the bedroom, not the kitchen. 

So the mistake here is that the user is in the bedroom, but the stove is in the kitchen. They need to go back to the kitchen to put the apple on the stove. The previous steps showed that after the garden, they went west to the kitchen, then west again to the bedroom. So to reach the kitchen again, they need to go east from the bedroom. 

Once in the kitchen, they can then put the apple on the stove. The user needs to first go east from the bedroom to the kitchen, then perform the action. The key here is to make sure they're in the correct location before trying to interact with the stove.

Well, here we are in a bathroom.

You can make out a closed toilet. You can see a bath. You can see a sink. The sink is normal. On the sink you make out a toothbrush.

There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

You've just sauntered into a kitchen.

You make out a closed refrigerator. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. But there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the counter. You see a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a kitchen island! The kitchen island is normal. On the kitchen island you can see a note. Huh, weird.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game where they have to follow a series of steps to win. The goal is to recover the apple from the garden, put it on the stove in the kitchen, and eventually reach the winner's objective.

Looking at the current state, the user has been moving between rooms, picking up the apple in the garden, and trying to get back to the kitchen. However, they're stuck in a loop between the kitchen and the bathroom, going north and south repeatedly. The problem is that the apple is in the kitchen, but the user can't see it there. The stove is in the kitchen, but the apple isn't on it. The user tried to put the apple on the stove but couldn't because they weren't in the right place.

Wait, the apple was picked up in the garden, so the user needs to go back to the kitchen to put it on the stove. But the current location is the kitchen, and the user is trying to go north again, which leads to the bathroom. That's not helpful. The user needs to check the kitchen again to put the apple on the stove. But the previous attempts to do so failed because the apple wasn't visible. Maybe the user needs to look around the kitchen again to find the stove and place the apple there.

Alternatively, maybe the user is in the kitchen but hasn't checked the stove properly. The game might require the apple to be on the stove, which is in the kitchen. Since the user has the apple, they need to go to the stove and place it there. But the user is stuck in a loop between rooms, so they need to stay in the kitchen and interact with the stove. The correct action would be to go to the stove and put the apple on it. However, the user's previous attempts to do that failed because they were in the wrong room or didn't check the right location.

So the next step should be to check the stove in the kitchen and place the apple there. The user is currently in the kitchen, so they should try putting the apple on the stove now. The command would be "put apple on stove" again, but the game might require the user to be in the correct location. Since the user is in the kitchen, this should work. The previous failures might have been due to the user not being in the right place or the game's state not updating correctly. Therefore, the correct action is to attempt to put the apple on the stove in the kitchen.
