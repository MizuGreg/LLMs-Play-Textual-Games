You are now playing a exciting game of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First stop, assure that the chest drawer in the bedroom is wide open. And then, pick up the old key from the chest drawer inside the bedroom. Then, check that the wooden door is unlocked with the old key. After unlocking the wooden door, assure that the wooden door is wide open. After that, head east. Then, ensure that the screen door in the kitchen is open. Then, make an attempt to move east. With that accomplished, make an attempt to head south. Then, pick-up the lettuce from the floor of the garden. Then, travel north. Then, try to take a trip west. Then, rest the lettuce on the stove inside the kitchen. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Bedroom =-
You arrive in a bedroom. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You make out a chest drawer. What's that over there? It looks like it's an antique trunk. Were you looking for a king-size bed? Because look over there, it's a king-size bed. The king-size bed is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps in the game. They started in the bedroom, opened the chest drawer, picked up the old key, unlocked the wooden door, and now the door is unlocked. The next step according to the original task was to assure that the wooden door is wide open. So after unlocking, they need to open it fully. The user's next action should be to open the wooden door. Then, after that, they need to head east. Let me check the previous steps again.

Wait, the user just unlocked the door. The next instruction was "assure that the wooden door is wide open." So the action here is to open the door. The command would be "open wooden door". Then, after that, they need to head east. So the next step after opening the door is to go east. But the user's current location is in the bedroom, and the wooden door leads east. So after opening the door, they should go east. But the user's next action is to open the door. The user hasn't done that yet. So the correct next command is "open wooden door".

You see a closed refrigerator. What's that over there? It looks like it's a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is ordinary. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. What's the point of an empty counter? You can see a stove. The stove is usual. The stove appears to be empty. You see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is standard. On the kitchen island you make out a note. Hmmm... what else, what else?

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what the next step should be. The user has been following a series of tasks in the text adventure game. So far, they've opened the chest drawer in the bedroom, picked up the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door leading east (which took them to the kitchen). Now, in the kitchen, they need to check the screen door, but the user might have misunderstood the instruction.

Looking back at the original task, after ensuring the wooden door is open, they should head east, then check the screen door in the kitchen, attempt to move east, then south, pick up the lettuce in the garden, travel north, try west, rest the lettuce on the stove, and finally stop.

In the current state, the user is in the kitchen. The next step after checking the screen door (which is closed) would be to open it. But the user's previous action was "check screen door in kitchen," which might not be the correct command. The game might expect "open screen door" instead. However, the user's response was "check screen door in kitchen," which the system interpreted as not understanding. So the user needs to correct that.

But according to the original instructions, after opening the wooden door and moving east to the kitchen, the next steps are: check that the screen door is open, then attempt to move east. So maybe the user needs to first open the screen door. However, the user's last action was "check screen door in kitchen," which might not be the right command. The correct command might be "open screen door" or "check screen door."

But the user's previous response was "check screen door in kitchen," and the system said they only understood up to wanting to check the screen door. So perhaps the next step is to actually open the screen door. However, the original task says to "ensure that the screen door in the kitchen is open." So maybe the user needs to open it. But the user's last action was checking, not opening. So the next action should be to open the screen door. But the user might have to first check if it's open. However, the system's response indicates that the user's previous action was not understood, so the user needs to try again.

Alternatively, maybe the user should try to move east from the kitchen. But the original task says after checking the screen door, attempt to move east. However, in the kitchen, there's a closed screen door leading east, and an open wooden door leading west. So maybe the user needs to open the screen door first. But the user's last action was checking the screen door, which might not be the correct command. The correct command might be "open screen door" or "check screen door."

But the user's previous action was "check screen door in kitchen," which the system didn't recognize. So the user needs to try the correct command. The correct command might be "open screen door" or "check screen door." However, the original task says to "check that the screen door is open," so maybe the user needs to check if it's open. If it's closed, then open it. But the user's last action was checking, which might not be the right command. The system might be expecting "open screen door" instead.

Alternatively, maybe the user should try to move east from the kitchen, but the screen door is closed. So the user needs to open it first. Therefore, the next action should be to open the screen door. But the user's previous action was checking, which might not be the correct command. So the user needs to try "open screen door" next.

There is an open screen door leading west. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps in the game. They started in the bedroom, opened the chest drawer, picked up the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, then went east to the kitchen. They opened the screen door, went east again to the backyard, then south to the garden.

In the garden, they found a half-bag of chips, lettuce, bell pepper, and a shovel on the floor. The next step according to the original task was to pick up the lettuce from the floor of the garden. The user hasn't done that yet. So the next action should be to pick up the lettuce. The current score is 8/9, so that's the next step. The user needs to pick up the lettuce, then travel north, try to go west, rest the lettuce on the stove, etc. So the immediate next action is to pick up the lettuce.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps in the game. They started in the bedroom, opened the chest drawer, picked up the key, unlocked and opened the door, then went east to the kitchen. They opened the screen door, went east again to the backyard, then south to the garden. In the garden, they picked up the lettuce and went north back to the backyard.

Now, the current location is the garden again. The task was to rest the lettuce on the stove in the kitchen. So after picking up the lettuce in the garden, the next step would be to go back to the kitchen. But the user just came from the backyard to the garden. The next action should be to go north to the backyard again, then west through the screen door to the kitchen. But the user's last action was going south from the backyard to the garden. Wait, the user is in the garden again. The next step is to go north to the backyard, then west to the kitchen. But the user hasn't gone west yet. However, the current prompt says to rest the lettuce on the stove in the kitchen. So the user needs to go to the kitchen and then place the lettuce on the stove.

But the user is in the garden. The previous steps were: pick up lettuce in garden, go north to backyard, then go south back to garden. Now, they need to go west from the backyard to the kitchen. So the next command should be to go west from the backyard. But the user is in the garden. Wait, the current location is the garden. The user needs to go north to the backyard, then west to the kitchen. So the next action is 'go north' to get back to the backyard. Then, from there, 'go west' to the kitchen. But the user is in the garden, so the immediate next step is to go north. But the user's last action was 'go south' to the garden. So the next step is to go north back to the backyard. Then, from the backyard, go west to the kitchen. Then, once in the kitchen, put the lettuce on the stove.

But the user's last action was 'go south' to the garden. So the next command should be 'go north' to return to the backyard. Then, from the backyard, 'go west' to the kitchen. Then, in the kitchen, 'put lettuce on stove'. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next step is to go north from the garden to the backyard. So the correct next command is 'go north'.

They opened the screen door, went east again to the backyard, then south to the garden where they picked up the lettuce. Now they're back in the backyard again, moving north and south repeatedly.

The current step in the task was to travel north after picking up the lettuce, then try to take a trip west, rest the lettuce on the stove in the kitchen. But the user is stuck in a loop between the backyard and garden. The lettuce is already picked up, so the next step should be to go west from the backyard, but the user is going north again. Wait, the last action was going north from the garden back to the backyard. The task says after picking up the lettuce, travel north, then try to take a trip west. So maybe after going north to the backyard, they need to go west through the screen door. But the user is repeatedly going north and south, which might not be necessary. The key is to rest the lettuce on the stove in the kitchen. So perhaps the user needs to go back to the kitchen, maybe through the west door, and then place the lettuce on the stove. But the current position is in the backyard. The screen door is open west, so going west from the backyard would lead back to the kitchen. Then, from the kitchen, go north to the garden? Wait, no.

So after picking up the lettuce in the garden, they should go back to the kitchen, maybe through the backyard's screen door west, then into the kitchen, then to the stove. But the user is currently in the backyard, so the next step should be to go west through the screen door to the kitchen. Then, from the kitchen, maybe go north to the garden again, but the main goal is to rest the lettuce on the stove.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to rest the lettuce on the stove. The previous attempt didn't work because "rest" isn't a recognized verb here. Maybe the correct command is "put" instead of "rest". In text adventures, common verbs for placing items are "put" or "place". So the correct action should be "put lettuce on stove". Let me check the game's context. The user has the lettuce in hand, so using "put" makes sense. I should suggest that as the next step.
