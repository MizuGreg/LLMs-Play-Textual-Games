You are now playing a fast paced episode of TextWorld! First, it would be fantastic if you could make absolutely sure that the chest drawer is ajar. Then, take the old key from the chest drawer. After that, assure that the wooden door is unlocked. And then, make absolutely sure that the wooden door within the bedroom is opened. And then, make an attempt to head east. If you can get around to doing that, look and see that the refrigerator within the kitchen is open. Once you have opened the refrigerator, pick up the milk from the refrigerator inside the kitchen. If you can get your hands on the milk, place the milk on the stove inside the kitchen. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Bedroom =-
You are in a bedroom. A normal kind of place.

You see a closed chest drawer. You can make out a closed antique trunk right there by you. You can see a king-size bed. The king-size bed is normal. But there isn't a thing on it.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps in the TextWorld game. They first opened the chest drawer, took the old key, then checked the wooden door. The next step according to the original instructions was to ensure the wooden door is unlocked. So after taking the key, the next logical step would be to unlock the door.

Wait, the user's last action was taking the key. Now they need to unlock the door. The command should be "unlock wooden door". But in the game's context, maybe the door is already unlocked? Let me check the previous messages. The user was told to "assure that the wooden door is unlocked" and then "make absolutely sure that the wooden door within the bedroom is opened". So maybe after unlocking, they need to open it. But the user has already taken the key, so the next step is to unlock the door. The correct command would be "unlock wooden door". Then, after that, they need to open it. But the user's next action should be based on the current state. Since the user just took the key, the next step is to unlock the door. So the answer is "unlock wooden door".

Okay, the user has unlocked and opened the wooden door. The next step according to the original instructions was to "make an attempt to head east." So after opening the door, they should try to go east. The command would be "go east." Let me check if there are any other steps in between. The original plan was: open chest drawer, take key, unlock door, open door, then go east. So after opening the door, the next action is definitely "go east."

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.

You make out a closed refrigerator. You see a counter. But there isn't a thing on it. Sometimes, just sometimes, TextWorld can just be the worst. You can see a stove. The stove is usual. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You move on, clearly angry about TextWorld. You can see a kitchen island. You wonder idly who left that here. You see a note on the kitchen island. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Okay, the user opened the refrigerator and found milk and lettuce. The next step was to pick up the milk. So the command should be "take milk from refrigerator". Let me check the previous steps. The original plan was: after opening the fridge, pick up the milk, then place it on the stove. So yes, take the milk first.

Okay, the user tried to "place milk on stove" but got an error. The correct command should be "put milk on stove". Let me check the possible verbs. "Put" is a valid verb here. So the next action is to put the milk on the stove.
