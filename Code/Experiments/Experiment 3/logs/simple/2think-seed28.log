Welcome to TextWorld! First of all, you could, like, doublecheck that the chest drawer is opened. And then, retrieve the old key from the chest drawer inside the bedroom. After that, check that the wooden door is unlocked with the old key. After that, open the wooden door. And then, travel east. Once you manage that, open the refrigerator within the kitchen. Then, recover the bell pepper from the refrigerator. If you have picked up the bell pepper, place the bell pepper on the stove inside the kitchen. Got that? Good!

-= Bedroom =-
You've just sauntered into a bedroom.

You make out a closed chest drawer nearby. You make out a closed antique trunk, which looks standard, nearby. You can make out a king-size bed. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. What's the point of an empty king-size bed?

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing a text-based game called TextWorld. The goal is to follow a series of steps to reach the original goal, which I assume is something like escaping or completing a quest. The user has already opened the chest drawer and retrieved the old key, but there was a mistake in the command.

First, the user tried "retrieve old key from chest drawer," but the system said that's not a recognized verb. So I need to figure out the correct command. In text adventures, common verbs are like 'take', 'get', 'open', 'use', etc. Since the key is in the chest drawer, the correct action would be to take the key. The previous step was opening the chest drawer, which revealed the key. So the next step should be taking the key.

But the user might have confused "retrieve" with "take." So the correct command here is "take old key." Alternatively, maybe "get old key." But in the game's context, the correct verb might be "take." Let me check the previous interaction. The user said "retrieve old key from chest drawer," which the system rejected. So the correct action is probably "take old key" without the "from chest drawer" part, since the key is already in the chest drawer after opening it. So the next action should be taking the key.

Then, after taking the key, the next step is to unlock the wooden door with the old key. So the user needs to use the key on the door. The command would be "unlock wooden door with old key" or "use old key on wooden door." But the game might expect "unlock wooden door" after using the key. Wait, the original instructions said to check that the wooden door is unlocked with the old key. So maybe the correct command is "unlock wooden door" using the key. But the exact command depends on the game's syntax.

Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "use old key on wooden door" to unlock it. But the user's previous action was retrieving the key, so after that, the next step is to unlock the door. So the correct command here is "unlock wooden door" using the key. However, the system might require the player to use the key first. So the next action after taking the key is to unlock the door.

But the user's last action was "retrieve old key from chest drawer," which was invalid. The correct command should be "take old key." Then, after taking the key, the next step is to unlock the door. So the user needs to take the key first. Therefore, the correct next action is "take old key."

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game, and they've been following the steps given. The original goal was to open the wooden door, then go east, open the fridge, get the bell pepper, and put it on the stove. So far, they've opened the chest drawer, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door. The next step mentioned was to open the wooden door, which they did. Now, the next action should be to go east through the door.

The user is asking if they're on the right track and if they're close. From the previous steps, they've completed the first part: getting the key and unlocking the door. The next logical step is to open the door fully and move east. The command would be "open wooden door" again, but since they just unlocked it, maybe "go east" is the next step. Wait, the initial instructions said after unlocking, open the door. But the user already unlocked it. Maybe the door is now open, so they can go through. The next step would be to go east. The user's last action was unlocking the door, and the next step is to go east. So the correct command is "go east".

Okay, let's see. The user is playing a text-based game where they need to follow a series of steps to reach the goal. The current situation is that they've unlocked the wooden door but it's still closed. The previous attempt to "go east" was blocked because the door wasn't open.

First, I need to recall the correct sequence of actions. The user was told to open the wooden door after unlocking it. Since the door is already unlocked, the next logical step is to open it. The user tried "go east" but was told they need to open the door first. So the correct action here is to open the door.

The user's last action was trying to go east, which didn't work. Now, they need to open the door. The command should be "open wooden door" or something similar. But in the game's context, the correct command might be "open door" if the door is the only object nearby. However, since the door was previously mentioned as "wooden door leading east," maybe the exact command is "open wooden door."

But looking at the previous interactions, when the user tried "unlock wooden door with old key," the game responded that it's already unlocked. So the next step is to open it. The correct command here is "open wooden door." The user needs to execute that command to proceed east.

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. A standard one. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

You can make out a refrigerator. You see a counter. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a stove. The stove appears to be empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You scan the room, seeing a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Kitchen now. The original goal was to retrieve the bell pepper from the refrigerator, place it on the stove, and maybe other steps. The user has already opened the wooden door east, which led to the kitchen. Now, the next step according to the initial instructions was to open the refrigerator in the kitchen. The user has to open the fridge, get the bell pepper, then put it on the stove.

Looking at the current description of the kitchen: the refrigerator is closed. The user needs to open it. The previous action was going east into the kitchen, so the next logical step is to open the refrigerator. The user has the old key, but maybe the fridge requires a different action. Wait, the key was used to unlock the wooden door, so maybe the fridge is just a regular door. The user should try opening the refrigerator. The command would be "open refrigerator". Let me check the previous steps again. The user was told to "open the refrigerator within the kitchen". So yes, the next action should be opening the fridge. Then retrieve the bell pepper. So the correct command here is "open refrigerator".

Okay, the user has been following the steps correctly. They opened the chest drawer, retrieved the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, then went east to the kitchen. Now they've opened the refrigerator, taken the bell pepper. The next step was to place the bell pepper on the stove. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action should be to go to the stove. Wait, the stove is in the kitchen. The user is already in the kitchen. So they need to place the bell pepper on the stove. But the command might be "put bell pepper on stove" or "place bell pepper on stove". Let me check the previous commands. The user used "take bell pepper from refrigerator". So the next step is to put it on the stove. The correct command would be "put bell pepper on stove". But I need to make sure that's the expected action here. Since the user is in the kitchen, and the stove is present, that's the next logical step.
