I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! First off, assure that the antique trunk within the bedroom is open. And then, take the old key from the antique trunk inside the bedroom. Once you have got the old key, doublecheck that the wooden door is unlocked. And then, open the wooden door. Once you have pulled open the wooden door, attempt to venture east. That done, make sure that the refrigerator is open. Then, recover the lettuce from the refrigerator in the kitchen. If you can get your hands on the lettuce, place the lettuce on the stove in the kitchen. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Bedroom =-
You've just walked into a bedroom.

You can see a chest drawer. You can see a closed antique trunk. What's that over there? It looks like it's a king-size bed. The king-size bed is ordinary. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, let me figure out what to do next. The user is in a text-based game where they need to follow specific steps to win. So far, they've opened the antique trunk, taken the old key, and now they need to double-check if the wooden door is unlocked. But the user tried "doublecheck wooden door is unlocked" and got an error because that's not a valid command.

Hmm, in text adventures, commands are usually verbs like "unlock" or "open". The correct action here would be to try unlocking the door with the key. Since the door is closed, maybe they need to use the key to unlock it. The previous step was taking the key, so the next logical step is to unlock the door. Let me check the game's context again. The user was told to "doublecheck that the wooden door is unlocked" after taking the key. But since the game doesn't recognize "doublecheck", maybe the correct action is to try unlocking it. So the right command would be "unlock wooden door" or "use old key on wooden door". But the game might expect "unlock" as the verb. Let me make sure. The user has the key, so using it to unlock the door makes sense. The correct command is probably "unlock wooden door".

GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. A typical one. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

You see a refrigerator. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. The counter is usual. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text adventure game. Their goal is to get the lettuce from the refrigerator, put it on the stove, and win. So far, they've opened the antique trunk, taken the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, then went east into the kitchen.

Now, in the kitchen, they need to make sure the refrigerator is open. The current description says the refrigerator is closed. The next step would be to open it. Then, after opening, they can look inside to find the lettuce. Once they take the lettuce, they need to place it on the stove. The stove is mentioned as being empty, so maybe it's already there, but they need to put the lettuce on it. Let me check the previous steps again.

The user's last action was going east into the kitchen. The current room is the kitchen. The next logical step is to open the refrigerator. The user has to interact with the refrigerator. The command would be "open refrigerator". Then, after that, they can take the lettuce from inside. Then go to the stove and put it there. The user's score is at 5/6, so they need to complete the remaining steps. The answer should be the next command, which is opening the refrigerator.
