You are now playing a life changing session of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First thing I need you to do is to assure that the chest drawer in the bedroom is open. Then, retrieve the old key from the chest drawer in the bedroom. After that, unlock the wooden door with the old key. And then, ensure that the wooden door in the bedroom is open. After that, make an attempt to move east. Following that, open the refrigerator. And then, pick up the apple from the refrigerator. After that, rest the apple on the stove. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Bedroom =-
You are in a bedroom. A normal one. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You make out a chest drawer. You can make out an antique trunk. You smell a wretched smell, and follow it to a king-size bed. The king-size bed is standard. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

-= Kitchen =-
Ah, the kitchen. This is some kind of kitchen, really great standard vibes in this place, a wonderful standard atmosphere. And now, well, you're in it.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a refrigerator. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. The counter appears to be empty. You see a stove. The stove is usual. But there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is standard. On the kitchen island you see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps in the game. They started by opening the chest drawer in the bedroom, retrieving the old key, unlocking and opening the wooden door to the east, which led them to the kitchen. Now, they're in the kitchen, opened the refrigerator, took the apple. The next step according to the original plan was to rest the apple on the stove.

So the current state is that the apple is in the player's inventory. The next action should be to go to the stove. But how to get there? The kitchen has a stove, a refrigerator, a kitchen island, a screen door east, a wooden door west (leading back to the bedroom), and exits north and south. Wait, the description says there's an open wooden door west, so maybe they can go back, but the plan is to proceed further.

Wait, the user's last action was taking the apple from the refrigerator. Now they need to rest the apple on the stove. So first, they need to be at the stove. The stove is in the kitchen, so they need to go there. But the current location is the kitchen. The stove is mentioned as being "usual" but not having anything on it. So the player is already in the kitchen. The next step is to go to the stove. But how? The player is in the kitchen, so maybe they can just go to the stove. But in the game's context, the player might need to move to the stove's location.

Wait, the game's description says: "You see a stove. The stove is usual. But there isn't a thing on it." So the player is in the kitchen, and the stove is there. So the next step is to go to the stove. But the player is already in the kitchen. Maybe the command is "go to stove" or "go to the stove". However, in the game's previous commands, the player used "go east" to move between rooms. But in the kitchen, the exits are north, south, east (screen door), west (open door). So perhaps the stove is in the same room, so the player doesn't need to move. But the game might require the player to interact with the stove.

Alternatively, maybe the player needs to go to the stove's location. Since the stove is in the kitchen, and the player is already there, the next step is to rest the apple on the stove. So the command would be "rest apple on stove" or similar. But the game's previous commands used verbs like "open", "take", "unlock", "go east". So maybe the correct command is "put apple on stove".

But the user's previous action was "take apple from refrigerator". Now, they need to put it on the stove. So the next command should be "put apple on stove". However, the game might require the player to be at the stove's location. Since the stove is in the kitchen, and the player is already there, that's possible.

So the next action is to put the apple on the stove. Therefore, the command is "put apple on stove".
