You are now playing a fast paced episode of TextWorld! First, it would be fantastic if you could make absolutely sure that the chest drawer is ajar. Then, take the old key from the chest drawer. After that, assure that the wooden door is unlocked. And then, make absolutely sure that the wooden door within the bedroom is opened. And then, make an attempt to head east. If you can get around to doing that, look and see that the refrigerator within the kitchen is open. Once you have opened the refrigerator, pick up the milk from the refrigerator inside the kitchen. If you can get your hands on the milk, place the milk on the stove inside the kitchen. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Bedroom =-
You are in a bedroom. A normal kind of place.

You see a closed chest drawer. You can make out a closed antique trunk right there by you. You can see a king-size bed. The king-size bed is normal. But there isn't a thing on it.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps in the TextWorld game. They first opened the chest drawer, took the old key, then checked the wooden door. The next step according to the original instructions was to ensure the wooden door is unlocked. So after taking the key, the next logical step would be to unlock the door.

Wait, the user's last action was taking the key. Now they need to unlock the door. The command should be "unlock wooden door". But in the game's context, maybe the door is already unlocked? Let me check the previous messages. The user was told to "assure that the wooden door is unlocked" and then "make absolutely sure that the wooden door within the bedroom is opened". So maybe after unlocking, they need to open it. But the user has already taken the key, so the next step is to unlock the door. The correct command would be "unlock wooden door". Then, after that, they need to open it. But the user's next action should be based on the current state. Since the user just took the key, the next step is to unlock the door. So the answer is "unlock wooden door".

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps given in the initial instructions. They started by opening the chest drawer, taking the old key, unlocking the wooden door, and then opening it. Now they're in the bedroom, having opened the door. The next step according to the original plan was to attempt to head east. But wait, the user is in the bedroom, and the wooden door leads east. So after opening the door, the next logical step would be to go through it into the east room, which is likely the kitchen.

But the user's last action was opening the wooden door, which is in the bedroom. The next command should be to move east. However, the user might need to check if the door is indeed leading to the kitchen. But according to the initial setup, the refrigerator is in the kitchen, so moving east from the bedroom would take them to the kitchen. Therefore, the next action should be "go east" to proceed to the kitchen. The user needs to make sure they are following the correct sequence of steps as outlined in the original instructions. So the correct next command is "go east".

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.

You make out a closed refrigerator. You see a counter. But there isn't a thing on it. Sometimes, just sometimes, TextWorld can just be the worst. You can see a stove. The stove is usual. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You move on, clearly angry about TextWorld. You can see a kitchen island. You wonder idly who left that here. You see a note on the kitchen island. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Okay, let me see. The user has to pick up the milk from the refrigerator. They just opened the refrigerator and found milk and lettuce. So the next step should be to take the milk. The previous action was opening the refrigerator, so now they need to pick up the milk. The correct command would be "take milk from refrigerator" but in the game's context, maybe just "take milk". But looking at the history, when they took the key, they said "take old key from chest drawer". So maybe the format is "take [item] from [container]". But the user's last action was "open refrigerator", and the response was that milk and lettuce are inside. So the next step is to take the milk. The assistant should output "take milk from refrigerator". But the user's instruction says to only output the action, like "go north". So perhaps the correct command is "take milk from refrigerator". But maybe the game allows just "take milk" if it's in the open container. Wait, the user just opened the refrigerator, so the milk is visible. The correct command would be "take milk from refrigerator". But the user's previous action was "open refrigerator", so maybe the next step is to take the milk. The assistant should respond with "take milk from refrigerator".
