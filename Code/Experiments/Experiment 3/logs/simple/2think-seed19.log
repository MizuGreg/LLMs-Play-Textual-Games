Welcome to another life changing episode of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, you could, like, doublecheck that the chest drawer is opened. Once you have opened the chest drawer, recover the old key from the chest drawer within the bedroom. And then, unlock the wooden door. Then, open the wooden door. Once you have opened the wooden door, attempt to go to the east. With that accomplished, make absolutely sure that the refrigerator within the kitchen is ajar. Then, pick up the milk from the refrigerator. After taking the milk, sit the milk on the stove. Got that? Good!

-= Bedroom =-
You've entered a bedroom. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

You make out a chest drawer. You see a closed antique trunk. You can see a king-size bed. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. This always happens, here in TextWorld!

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game. The current scene is the bedroom. The task is to open the chest drawer, get the old key from the chest drawer, unlock the wooden door, open it, go east, make sure the fridge in the kitchen is ajar, pick up milk, and put it on the stove.

So far, the user tried to "recover old key from chest drawer," but the system said that's not a recognized verb. The user is now asking if they're on the right track and what their next action should be. They also want to know if they're close to the goal.

First, I need to figure out what the correct action is. The previous step was opening the chest drawer, which was successful. The next step was to recover the old key from the chest drawer. But the system didn't recognize that command. Maybe the correct verb is "take" or "get" instead of "recover." In text adventures, common verbs are "take," "get," "open," "use," etc. So maybe the user should use "take old key from chest drawer" or "get old key from chest drawer."

But the user's previous attempt was "recover old key from chest drawer," which the system rejected. So the correct action might be to use "take" instead. Alternatively, maybe the key is already in the chest drawer, and the user needs to pick it up. So the correct command would be "take old key from chest drawer."

But the system's response was that "recover" isn't a recognized verb. So the user should use "take" instead. Therefore, the next action should be "take old key from chest drawer."

Then, after taking the key, the next step is to unlock the wooden door. So once the key is taken, the user would use the key to unlock the door. But first, they need to take the key.

So the user's next action should be to take the key from the chest drawer. That's the correct step here. The user might have used "recover" instead of "take," which is why it didn't work. So the correct command is "take old key from chest drawer."

Okay, let me figure out what to do next. The user has already opened the chest drawer, took the old key, unlocked the wooden door, and now the next step was to open the wooden door. So after unlocking, the next action should be to open it. The user just did that, so now they need to go east. Then, they have to check the refrigerator in the kitchen and get the milk. But the current location is the bedroom after opening the door. So the next command should be "go east" to move to the next room. Let me confirm the steps again. The original task was: open chest drawer, get key, unlock door, open door, go east, check fridge, get milk, put milk on stove. So after opening the door, going east is the next step. The user is in the bedroom, after opening the door, so "go east" is the correct command here.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to progress through the game. They've already opened the chest drawer, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door, and tried to go east. But the game says they have to open the wooden door first. Wait, they just unlocked it, so maybe they need to open it again? Or maybe "unlock" and "open" are different actions here.

The original task was to unlock the wooden door, then open it. The user tried to go east before opening it. The game is pointing out that they need to open the door first. So maybe after unlocking, they need to explicitly open it. Let me check the previous steps.

The user said "unlock wooden door with old key", which worked. Then they tried "go east", but the game said they need to open the door first. So perhaps the door is unlocked but not open. So the next step is to open the door. Then they can go east. So the correct action now is to open the wooden door.

Okay, the user is trying to follow the steps in the TextWorld game. Let me see where they are. They've opened the chest drawer, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door, and opened it. Now they need to check if the refrigerator in the kitchen is ajar. The next step is to make sure the refrigerator is open. The user tried "make sure refrigerator in kitchen is ajar" but the system said that's not a verb. So I need to figure out the correct command.

In TextWorld, commands are usually verbs. So instead of "make sure," they might need to use "open" or "check." Since the goal is to ensure the refrigerator is ajar, the correct action is probably "open refrigerator" or "check refrigerator." But the user's previous actions were more about interacting with objects directly. Let me check the original task again.

The original task said: "make absolutely sure that the refrigerator within the kitchen is ajar." So the action here is to open the refrigerator. The user might have tried "open refrigerator" but the system didn't accept it. Wait, the user's last attempt was "make sure refrigerator in kitchen is ajar," which is a phrase, not a verb. The correct command should be "open refrigerator" or "check refrigerator." But in the game's context, maybe "open" is the right verb. Let me think. The user is in the bedroom, and after opening the door, they need to go to the kitchen. So maybe the next step is to go to the kitchen and then open the refrigerator. But the user's current location is the bedroom, after opening the door. Wait, the wooden door was leading east, so after going east, they would be in the kitchen. But the user hasn't moved yet. Wait, the previous step was "open wooden door," so now they are in the kitchen? Or is the door leading to the kitchen? The initial description said the wooden door leads east. So after opening it, they need to go east to the kitchen. Then, once in the kitchen, check the refrigerator.

But the user's next action was "make sure refrigerator in kitchen is ajar," which is not a valid command. So the correct command should be "open refrigerator" or "check refrigerator." But the user might need to first go to the kitchen. Wait, the user is in the bedroom, after opening the door. So they need to go east to the kitchen. Then, once in the kitchen, open the refrigerator. But the user hasn't moved yet. So the correct sequence is: go east (to the kitchen), then open the refrigerator. But the user's last action was "open wooden door," so now they are in the kitchen. Then the next step is to open the refrigerator. But the user tried "make sure..." which is invalid. So the correct command is "open refrigerator." But the system might expect "open" as the verb. So the user should say "open refrigerator." But the user's previous attempt was "make sure..." which is not a verb. So the correct answer is "open refrigerator."

Oh, great. Here's a refrigerator. You make out a counter. The counter is ordinary. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. You see a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You can see a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island. Huh, weird.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Kitchen now. The task was to make sure the refrigerator is ajar. But earlier, when they tried to "make sure refrigerator in kitchen is ajar", the system said that's not a verb. Then they tried "open refrigerator", but the system said they can't see any such thing. Wait, but in the current description, the refrigerator is mentioned as being present. Let me check the current room description again.

In the Kitchen, the user sees a refrigerator. The problem might be that the refrigerator is closed. The user needs to open it. But the previous attempt to "open refrigerator" didn't work. Maybe the correct verb is "open" followed by the object. But the system might require a specific command. Alternatively, maybe the refrigerator is already open? Wait, the user's task was to "make absolutely sure that the refrigerator within the kitchen is ajar." So they need to open it if it's closed. But the system's response when they tried "open refrigerator" was "You can't see any such thing." That's confusing because the refrigerator is described as being there. Maybe the user needs to use a different verb, like "unlock" or "open" with the correct object. Alternatively, maybe the refrigerator is already open, and the user just needs to check. But the task says to make sure it's ajar, so perhaps the user needs to open it. But the system's previous response indicated that "open refrigerator" wasn't recognized. Maybe the correct command is "open refrigerator" but the system is having issues. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use "open" without the object, but that's not standard. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "open the refrigerator". But the system might not accept that. Wait, the user's previous action was "go east", which led them to the kitchen. Now, in the kitchen, the user needs to open the refrigerator. The correct command would be "open refrigerator". But the system said "You can't see any such thing." That's conflicting. Maybe the user needs to check if the refrigerator is already open. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use a different verb. But the task says to "make sure the refrigerator is ajar", so the user needs to open it. Maybe the system is expecting "open refrigerator" but the user's previous attempt was incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "open the refrigerator". But the system might not accept "the". Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "open" the refrigerator. But the system's response was that it can't see any such thing. Wait, the current room description says "You see a refrigerator." So it should be there. Maybe the user needs to try "open refrigerator" again. But the system said it's not recognized. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "open" the refrigerator. But the system might require the object. Hmm. The user's next action should be to open the refrigerator. Even though the system said "You can't see any such thing", maybe that's a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check if the refrigerator is already open. But the task says to make sure it's ajar. So the correct action is to open it. Therefore, the user should try "open refrigerator" again.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps in the game. They started by opening the chest drawer, getting the key, unlocking the door, and going east to the kitchen. Now they've opened the refrigerator, taken the milk, and the next step is to put the milk on the stove.

The previous action was taking the milk from the refrigerator. The next logical step would be to go to the stove. But wait, in the kitchen description, the stove is mentioned as being present. So the user needs to go to the stove location. The current location is the kitchen, so they should go to the stove. The command would be "go to stove" or "go to stove". But the game might expect a specific command. Alternatively, since the stove is in the kitchen, maybe they just need to go to the stove's location. Let me check the previous steps again.

The user is in the kitchen, and the stove is mentioned as being there. The correct action would be to go to the stove. The command should be "go to stove". But the system might require a different phrasing. Alternatively, maybe "go to stove" is acceptable. The user has to make sure they are at the stove before putting the milk on it. So the next action is to go to the stove.
