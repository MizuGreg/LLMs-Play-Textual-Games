Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, you could, like, look and see that the antique trunk inside the bedroom is opened. Then, recover the old key from the antique trunk. Then, make absolutely sure that the wooden door inside the bedroom is unlocked. After unlocking the wooden door, open the wooden door in the bedroom. Then, try to head east. After that, try to travel south. Once you get through with that, take the milk from the couch within the living room. Having taken the milk, attempt to travel north. That done, rest the milk on the stove inside the kitchen. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Bedroom =-
You make a grand eccentric entrance into a bedroom.

You see a closed normal looking chest drawer right there by you. You can see an antique trunk. You see a king-size bed. But the thing is empty.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me figure out what to do next. The user has been following the steps given. So far, they've looked at the antique trunk, opened it to get the old key, and tried to unlock the wooden door. But the door is fixed, so maybe they need to use the key to unlock it.

Wait, the current location is the bedroom, and the wooden door is leading east. The user tried to unlock it but it was fixed. Maybe the key is needed to unlock it. Since they have the old key from the trunk, they should try using it on the door. The next logical step would be to use the key on the wooden door to unlock it. Then, after unlocking, they can open the door and proceed east as instructed. Let me check the previous steps again. The user had the key, so using it on the door makes sense. The next action should be to unlock the door with the key.

Okay, let me figure out what to do next. The user has been following the steps given. So far, they've opened the antique trunk, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door, and opened it. Now they need to head east, then south, get the milk from the living room couch, travel north, and rest the milk on the stove in the kitchen.

After opening the wooden door, the next step was to try heading east. The user just opened the door, so the next action should be to go east. Let me check the previous steps to make sure. The last action was unlocking and opening the door, so the next command should be "go east". Then, after that, they need to go south. But first, they have to move east. The user is in the bedroom, just opened the door leading east. So "go east" is the next logical step. Then, once they are east, they can try going south. But the user's next action should be "go east" now.

Well how about that, you are in a place we're calling a kitchen. The room is well lit.

You make out a closed refrigerator nearby. You can see a counter. The counter is normal. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove. You see a kitchen island. On the kitchen island you can see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game where they have to follow a series of steps to win. So far, they've opened the antique trunk, taken the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door in the bedroom, then went east into the kitchen. The current location is the kitchen, and the user has a score of 5 out of 10.

The next steps according to the original instructions were: after unlocking the wooden door and opening it, try to head east, then travel south. Then, take the milk from the couch in the living room, travel north, rest the milk on the stove in the kitchen, and that's when you win.

But in the current scenario, the user is in the kitchen. The kitchen has a refrigerator, a counter, a stove, a kitchen island with a note, a screen door east, an open wooden door west (which leads back to the bedroom?), and an exit to the north. The提示 says to try going south from the kitchen. Wait, the user just came from the bedroom east, so maybe the kitchen's south is the bedroom? But the user is in the kitchen now. The original plan was to go east (into kitchen), then south. But the kitchen's south might lead back to the bedroom. However, the user's next action is to go south from the kitchen. But the kitchen's description says there's an exit to the north, and the user is told to try going south. So maybe the user needs to go south from the kitchen to reach the living room or another area where the milk is on the couch.

Wait, the original goal was to take the milk from the couch in the living room. So after getting to the kitchen, the next step would be to go south to the living room. But the user is in the kitchen now. The current room's description says there's an exit to the north, and the user is told to try going south. So the user should go south from the kitchen. But the user's last action was going east into the kitchen. Now, the next step is to go south from the kitchen. However, the user's current location is the kitchen, and the possible directions are east (screen door), west (open door to bedroom), north (exit), and south. The user needs to go south to reach the living room where the milk is. So the correct next action is to go south. But the user has to check if that's possible. The kitchen's description says "You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south." So the user is told to try going south. Therefore, the next action should be 'go south'.

-= Living Room =-
Well I'll be, you are in the place we're calling the living room.

You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a couch. You see a milk on the couch. You see a low table. The low table is standard. On the low table you see a remote. You scan the room for a tv, and you find a tv. The tv is ordinary. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Okay, let's see. The user has to follow a series of steps to complete the game. So far, they've done most of the tasks: opened the trunk, got the key, unlocked and opened the bedroom door, went east to the kitchen, took the milk from the living room, and went north back to the kitchen. Now, the next step is to rest the milk on the stove in the kitchen.

Wait, in the kitchen scene, the user is currently in the kitchen again. The task is to rest the milk on the stove. But in the previous interaction, after taking the milk from the living room and going north, they ended up back in the kitchen. The stove is mentioned as being empty, so the milk needs to be placed there.

The user's last action was "go north", which brought them back to the kitchen. Now, they need to rest the milk on the stove. The correct command here would be to use the milk they took and place it on the stove. The game's current state in the kitchen has the stove mentioned as being empty, so that's the right place. The next action should be to rest the milk on the stove. Let me check if there's any other step needed. The original goal was to rest the milk on the stove after taking it from the living room. So yes, the next command is to rest the milk on the stove.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to rest the milk on the stove. The previous attempt to use "rest milk on stove" was rejected because it's not a recognized verb. So, I need to figure out the correct command.

In text adventures, actions are usually verbs that match the game's vocabulary. The user has already taken the milk from the couch and is now in the kitchen. The goal is to rest the milk on the stove. The correct verb here might be "put" instead of "rest". So the correct command should be "put milk on stove".

Let me check the previous interactions. The user tried "rest", which didn't work. So changing "rest" to "put" makes sense. The game might expect "put" as the verb for placing an object. Therefore, the next action should be "put milk on stove".
