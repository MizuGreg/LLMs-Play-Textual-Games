Welcome to another life changing episode of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, you could, like, doublecheck that the chest drawer is opened. Once you have opened the chest drawer, recover the old key from the chest drawer within the bedroom. And then, unlock the wooden door. Then, open the wooden door. Once you have opened the wooden door, attempt to go to the east. With that accomplished, make absolutely sure that the refrigerator within the kitchen is ajar. Then, pick up the milk from the refrigerator. After taking the milk, sit the milk on the stove. Got that? Good!

-= Bedroom =-
You've entered a bedroom. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

You make out a chest drawer. You see a closed antique trunk. You can see a king-size bed. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. This always happens, here in TextWorld!

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game. The current scene is the bedroom. The task is to open the chest drawer, get the old key from the chest drawer, unlock the wooden door, open it, go east, make sure the fridge in the kitchen is ajar, pick up milk, and put it on the stove.

So far, the user tried to "recover old key from chest drawer," but the system said that's not a recognized verb. The user is now asking if they're on the right track and what their next action should be. They also want to know if they're close to the goal.

First, I need to figure out what the correct action is. The previous step was opening the chest drawer, which was successful. The next step was to recover the old key from the chest drawer. But the system didn't recognize that command. Maybe the correct verb is "take" or "get" instead of "recover." In text adventures, common verbs are "take," "get," "open," "use," etc. So maybe the user should use "take old key from chest drawer" or "get old key from chest drawer."

But the user's previous attempt was "recover old key from chest drawer," which the system rejected. So the correct action might be to use "take" instead. Alternatively, maybe the key is already in the chest drawer, and the user needs to pick it up. So the correct command would be "take old key from chest drawer."

But the system's response was that "recover" isn't a recognized verb. So the user should use "take" instead. Therefore, the next action should be "take old key from chest drawer."

Then, after taking the key, the next step is to unlock the wooden door. So once the key is taken, the user would use the key to unlock the door. But first, they need to take the key.

So the user's next action should be to take the key from the chest drawer. That's the correct step here. The user might have used "recover" instead of "take," which is why it didn't work. So the correct command is "take old key from chest drawer."

Okay, let's see. The user has successfully opened the chest drawer, taken the old key, and used it to unlock the wooden door. The next step in the original task was to open the wooden door. So after unlocking it, they need to open it. The command would be "open wooden door".

Then, after opening the door, they need to go east. So once the door is open, the next action is "go east". After that, they have to check the kitchen fridge, make sure it's ajar, pick up the milk, and put it on the stove. But the user's current step is after opening the door, so the immediate next action is "go east".

The user is asking if they're on the right track. Since they've completed the first three steps (open chest, take key, unlock door), they're close. The next steps are straightforward. So the correct command here is "open wooden door".

You are in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place. The room is well lit.

Oh, great. Here's a refrigerator. You make out a counter. The counter is ordinary. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. You see a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You can see a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island. Huh, weird.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

Okay, the user has gone east from the bedroom into the kitchen. The next step according to the original task is to make sure the refrigerator in the kitchen is ajar. So the action here would be to "open refrigerator" or "unlock refrigerator". But in the kitchen description, the refrigerator is mentioned as closed. So the correct command is "open refrigerator".

After that, the user needs to pick up the milk from the fridge. So once the fridge is open, they can take the milk. Then put it on the stove. But the current step is to check the fridge. So the next action is to open the refrigerator.
