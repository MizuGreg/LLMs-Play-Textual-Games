Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is how to play! First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to ensure that the antique trunk in the bedroom is open. And then, take the old key from the antique trunk inside the bedroom. After that, unlock the wooden door inside the bedroom. After unlocking the wooden door, ensure that the wooden door inside the bedroom is open. And then, make an effort to travel east. After that, doublecheck that the screen door is open. And then, make an effort to move east. And then, go to the south. And then, recover the half of a bag of chips from the floor of the garden. After you have taken the half of a bag of chips, make an attempt to take a trip north. Following that, make an attempt to venture west. Next, place the half of a bag of chips on the stove inside the kitchen. Got that? Good!

-= Bedroom =-
You find yourself in a bedroom. An usual one. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

You can make out a closed chest drawer. You see a closed antique trunk. You can see a king-size bed. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps given in the initial instructions. They first opened the antique trunk, took the old key, then unlocked the wooden door. Now, the next step according to the original plan was to ensure the wooden door is open. Wait, after unlocking it, they need to check if it's open. But maybe unlocking automatically opens it? Or maybe they need to explicitly open it again.

Looking at the current state in the bedroom, there's a closed wooden door leading east. The user just unlocked it, so perhaps the next step is to open it. But the instruction said after unlocking, ensure it's open. So maybe they need to open it again. But sometimes in these games, unlocking a door might not automatically open it. So the correct action here would be to open the wooden door.

Then, after that, they need to travel east. So the next steps are: open the wooden door, then go east. Then check the screen door (maybe another door?), then move east again, then go south, etc. But the user's current location is the bedroom. So the immediate next action is to open the wooden door. Let me check the previous steps again.

Original plan: After unlocking the wooden door, ensure it's open. So maybe the user has to open it again. So the next command should be "open wooden door". Then go east. But the user's last action was taking the key, and the next step is to unlock the door. Wait, the original instructions said: "After that, unlock the wooden door inside the bedroom. After unlocking the wooden door, ensure that the wooden door inside the bedroom is open." So the user has already unlocked it, but needs to check if it's open. So maybe the next step is to open it. But maybe unlocking is the same as opening. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the door was locked, and unlocking it makes it open. So after unlocking, the door is open. So the next step is to go east. But the user's current location is the bedroom, and the wooden door is east. So after unlocking, they need to go east. But the user's last action was taking the key, so the next step is to unlock the door. Wait, the user just took the key, so the next action should be to unlock the door. Wait, the original instructions said: "After that, unlock the wooden door inside the bedroom." So after taking the key, the next action is to unlock the door. But the user hasn't done that yet. Wait, the user's last action was taking the key, and the next step in the plan is to unlock the door. So the next command should be "unlock wooden door".

But looking at the current state, the wooden door is closed. So the user needs to unlock it. So the next action is to unlock the wooden door. Then, after unlocking, ensure it's open. So maybe the next step is to unlock it. So the correct command here is "unlock wooden door".

Okay, let's see. The user is in the kitchen. The original plan was to travel east after opening the door in the bedroom. But after going east from the kitchen, they encountered a screen door that's closed. Wait, the user just came from the bedroom, so they might have gone through the open wooden door west to get here. Now, the kitchen has a closed screen door east, an open west door, a north entrance, and a south exit.

The next step in the original instructions was to double-check that the screen door is open. But the user hasn't done that yet. Wait, the original steps said: after moving east from the bedroom, double-check the screen door is open, then move east again. But the user is now in the kitchen. So maybe they need to check the screen door east here. But the screen door is closed. So the next action should be to open it. But the user's current location is the kitchen, and the screen door is east. So the command would be "open screen door". Alternatively, maybe they need to go north or south first. But the original plan said after moving east, check the screen door, then move east again. So perhaps the user needs to open the screen door here. But the screen door is closed, so they need to open it. So the next action is "open screen door".

Okay, the user tried to "place half of a bag of chips on stove" but the game didn't recognize it. Maybe the correct command is "put half of a bag of chips on stove". Let me check the possible commands. The user has the half bag of chips in hand. The stove is in the kitchen. So the correct action is to put the chips on the stove. The previous command was "place", which didn't work. Maybe "put" is the correct verb. So the next action should be "put half of a bag of chips on stove".
