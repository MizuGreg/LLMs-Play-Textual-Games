Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, you could, like, ensure that the chest drawer is open. And then, take the old key from the chest drawer inside the bedroom. With the old key, doublecheck that the wooden door is unlocked. And then, open the wooden door within the bedroom. Then, attempt to go east. Then, make absolutely sure that the screen door inside the kitchen is opened. And then, attempt to venture east. Next, travel south. And then, lift the half of a bag of chips from the floor of the garden. Then, make an effort to move north. If you can finish that, venture west. And then, rest the half of a bag of chips on the stove. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Bedroom =-
You've just sauntered into a bedroom. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

You can see a chest drawer. You can see an antique trunk. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You see a king-size bed. The king-size bed is usual. The king-size bed appears to be empty.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

You arrive in a kitchen. An usual kind of place.

You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a refrigerator. Hmmm... what else, what else? You smell an intriguing smell, and follow it to a counter. The counter is standard. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You see a stove. The stove is ordinary. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is ordinary. On the kitchen island you see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

You find yourself in a backyard. A typical one. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

You see a set of chairs. The set of chairs appears to be empty. You move on, clearly depressed by your TextWorld experience. You see a bbq. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a patio table. The patio table is normal. But the thing is empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the patio table.

There is an open screen door leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in the Backyard and has already completed several steps. They need to lift the half of a bag of chips from the floor of the garden. Wait, the current location is the Backyard, and the task mentions the garden. Maybe the garden is part of the Backyard? The user has to find the half-bag of chips on the floor.

Looking at the Backyard description: the user sees chairs, a BBQ, a patio table. The patio table is normal but empty. The chairs are empty. The user needs to find the chips. Maybe the chips are on the patio table or somewhere else. But the description doesn't mention the chips yet. Wait, the user's previous action was going east from the kitchen, which led to the Backyard. The next step is to lift the half-bag of chips from the garden's floor. So maybe the garden is a different area, but the user is in the Backyard now. Maybe the garden is part of the Backyard, so the user needs to check the floor here.

The user's next action should be to pick up the chips. But the current description doesn't mention the chips. Wait, maybe the user needs to search the area. The user is in the Backyard, and the task says to lift the half of a bag of chips from the floor of the garden. So perhaps the garden is part of the Backyard, and the user needs to look around. The user might need to check the floor where they are. Since the patio table is empty, maybe the chips are on the ground. The user should pick them up.

So the next command would be to take the half-bag of chips. But the user needs to first find it. However, in the current Backyard description, there's no mention of the chips. Maybe the user needs to look around. But according to the game's structure, the user might have to interact with the environment. Since the user is in the Backyard, and the task is to lift the chips from the garden's floor, perhaps the user needs to check the floor here. The correct action would be to pick up the chips once they are found. But since the description doesn't mention them, maybe the user needs to look for it. However, the game might have the chips already in the scene. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to move to the garden area. But the current location is the Backyard. Maybe the garden is part of the Backyard, so the user can pick it up here.

So the next action is to pick up the half of a bag of chips. The user's next command should be "take half of a bag of chips from floor" or something similar. But the game might have specific commands. The user's previous actions were "open screen door", "go east", which led to the Backyard. Now, the user needs to find the chips. The correct command would be to take the chips from the floor. So the next action is "take half of a bag of chips from floor".

Okay, the user is stuck in the Backyard and can't find the half-bag of chips. They've tried looking around, under the patio table, but nothing. The goal is to lift the chips from the garden's floor, rest them on the stove, and win. Since the current location is the Backyard, maybe the garden is part of this area. The user needs to check again or maybe move to another part. But the commands available don't include searching specifically. Maybe the chips are on the floor but not visible. The user might need to use 'look' again or check the floor. Alternatively, perhaps the user needs to go south as mentioned in the room description. Let me check the previous steps.

The user was in the Backyard, and the room description says there's an unblocked exit to the south. Maybe the garden is south of here. So the next step could be to go south, then look for the chips. Alternatively, maybe the chips are already here but not noticed. But the user tried looking and didn't find them. Maybe the correct action is to go south and check there. So the next command should be 'go south'.

Well how about that, you are in the place we're calling the garden. Let's see what's in here.



There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

There is an apple, a lettuce, a half of a bag of chips and a shovel on the floor.

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

There is an apple, a lettuce, a half of a bag of chips and a shovel on the floor.

Okay, the user is in the Garden and sees the half of a bag of chips on the floor. The previous attempt to take it failed, but now the room description explicitly lists it. The correct command should be to take the half of a bag of chips from the floor. The user needs to use the exact command format. The available commands include 'take ... from ...', so the correct action is 'take half of a bag of chips from floor'.

Okay, the user is trying to take the half of a bag of chips from the floor in the Garden, but the game isn't recognizing it. Let me check the previous steps. The user was in the Garden, and the room description says there's a half of a bag of chips on the floor. The command "take half of a bag of chips from floor" was tried multiple times, but it's not working. Maybe the correct command is just "take half of a bag of chips" without specifying "from floor" since the object is on the floor by default. Alternatively, maybe the game expects a different phrasing. Let me think about the available commands. The "take ... from ..." command is available, but perhaps the chips are already on the floor, so using "take half of a bag of chips" without "from" might work. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use "take" instead of "take from". Let me try that.

Okay, the user is trying to put the half of a bag of chips on the stove in the Garden. But the game says "You can't see any such thing." Let me check the previous steps. The user picked up the chips, but now the stove isn't in the current room. The Garden description doesn't mention a stove. The stove was in the Kitchen. So the user needs to go back to the Kitchen to put the chips on the stove. The correct action is to go north back to the Kitchen, then put the chips on the stove there. But the user is in the Garden, so the next step is to go north.

You find yourself in a backyard. A typical one. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

You see a set of chairs. The set of chairs appears to be empty. You move on, clearly depressed by your TextWorld experience. You see a bbq. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a patio table. The patio table is normal. But the thing is empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the patio table.

There is an open screen door leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

On the kitchen island you see a note.
