Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First, it would be good if you could open the chest drawer within the bedroom. And then, take the old key from the chest drawer within the bedroom. With the old key, unlock the wooden door. Then, ensure that the wooden door within the bedroom is open. After that, make an effort to head east. If you can accomplish that, open the refrigerator inside the kitchen. After that, recover the lettuce from the refrigerator in the kitchen. After that, rest the lettuce on the stove. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Bedroom =-
You're now in the bedroom. Let's see what's in here.

You can make out a closed chest drawer. You see an antique trunk. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You make out a king-size bed. The king-size bed is normal. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.
