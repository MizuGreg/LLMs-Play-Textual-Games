Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! First of all, ensure that the antique trunk is open. And then, recover the old key from the antique trunk. With the old key, unlock the wooden door. And then, ensure that the wooden door is open. Then, make an effort to go to the east. After that, ensure that the screen door inside the kitchen is open. After pulling open the screen door, take a trip east. Next, attempt to venture south. After that, pick up the apple from the floor of the garden. After that, travel north. With that accomplished, go west. And then, sit the apple on the stove within the kitchen. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Bedroom =-
You arrive in a bedroom. A typical one. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You can make out a closed chest drawer, which looks usual, in the corner. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see an antique trunk. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a king-size bed. The king-size bed is standard. But there isn't a thing on it.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text adventure game called TextWorld. The goal is to follow a series of steps to win. So far, they've opened the antique trunk, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door, and tried to go east. But the game said they need to open the wooden door first. Wait, they just unlocked it, so maybe they need to open it again? Or maybe the door is locked and they need to use the key again?

Looking back at the previous steps: The user had a closed wooden door leading east. They used the old key to unlock it. The game responded with "You unlock wooden door." Then the user tried to go east, but the game said they have to open the wooden door first. That's confusing because they just unlocked it. Maybe the door is now unlocked but needs to be opened again? Or perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the game's feedback.

The user is now asking if they're on the right track and what their next move should be. The score is at 3/5, so they have a few steps left. The next steps in the original instruction were: after unlocking the door, go east, then open the screen door in the kitchen, go east again, venture south, pick up the apple, travel north, go west, and put the apple on the stove. But they might be stuck at the door.

So, the user's next action should be to open the wooden door again, even though they just unlocked it. Maybe the game considers unlocking and opening as separate steps. Alternatively, maybe the door is locked again after unlocking. But according to the game's message, they need to open the door first. So the correct action would be to open the wooden door again. Wait, but they already unlocked it. Maybe the game is expecting them to open it, not just unlock. So the next step is to open the wooden door. Then proceed east.

Well I'll be, you are in the place we're calling the kitchen.

You see a refrigerator. You make out a counter. The counter is ordinary. But the thing is empty. You make out a stove. The stove is ordinary. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You make out a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

Fancy seeing you here. Here, by the way, being the backyard. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You can make out a set of chairs. The set of chairs is standard. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a bbq. The bbq is normal. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a patio table. The patio table is usual. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is an open screen door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Backyard now. The next steps according to the original plan were: after going east from the kitchen, venture south, pick up the apple from the garden, travel north, go west, and put the apple on the stove. But the user is in the Backyard, which is south of the kitchen. So maybe the next step is to go south from the Backyard to reach the garden where the apple is. The user needs to pick up the apple there. Then go north to the kitchen, west to the stove, and put the apple on it. But the current location is the Backyard, so the next action should be to go south. Let me check the environment description. The Backyard has an open screen door leading west and an unblocked exit to the south. So the user should go south to the garden. The apple is on the floor of the garden, so after going south, they can pick it up. Then proceed north to the kitchen, west to the stove, and put the apple there. So the next command is go south.

-= Garden =-

There is an unblocked exit to the north.

There is a half of a bag of chips, a bell pepper, an apple and a shovel on the floor.

Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is trying to pick up the apple from the garden. The game says that when they tried to take the apple, it didn't work. Then they tried "pick up apple from floor" again, but the game still didn't recognize it. The correct command should be "take apple" or "pick up apple". The game might be expecting a simpler command. Let me check the previous interactions. The user tried "take apple from floor" which didn't work, then "pick up apple from floor" which also didn't work. The game's response was "I only understood you as far as wanting to pick up the apple." So maybe the correct command is just "take apple" or "pick up apple" without specifying "from floor". The user needs to try a different phrasing. The next step is to try "take apple" or "pick up apple" again.
