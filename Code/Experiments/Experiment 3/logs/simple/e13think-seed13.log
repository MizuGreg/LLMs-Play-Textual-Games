I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is how to play! First, it would be great if you could ensure that the chest drawer within the bedroom is open. And then, retrieve the old key from the chest drawer. And then, unlock the wooden door with the old key. And then, ensure that the wooden door within the bedroom is open. And then, make an attempt to go east. And then, open the screen door. After opening the screen door, make an effort to go to the east. Then, take a trip south. And then, retrieve the bell pepper from the floor of the garden. If you can get your hands on the bell pepper, head north. Then, travel west. After that, rest the bell pepper on the stove. Got that? Good!

-= Bedroom =-
You're now in the bedroom. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You can make out a chest drawer. You can see a closed antique trunk. You make out a king-size bed. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Hm. Oh well

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. You make out a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. The stove is ordinary. The stove appears to be empty. You can see a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

You can see a set of chairs. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a set of chairs, go to TextWorld. The set of chairs is usual. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You see a bbq. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You swear loudly. You can see a patio table. Now why would someone leave that there? But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a sequence of actions in TextWorld. They've already retrieved the old key, unlocked the door, opened the screen door, and moved to the garden. The next step was to retrieve the bell pepper from the floor. But when they tried "retrieve bell pepper from floor," the game didn't recognize it. Then they tried "take bell pepper from floor," but the game said they can't see any such thing.

Wait, maybe the correct verb is "take" instead of "retrieve"? Or maybe the object is just "bell pepper" without specifying "from floor." Let me check the game's possible commands. In TextWorld, typical verbs are "take," "put," "use," "open," "close," etc. So maybe the correct command is "take bell pepper." But the user tried "take bell pepper from floor" and it didn't work. However, the game might not require specifying the location if the object is already in the current room. Since the user is in the garden, and the bell pepper is on the floor, maybe just "take bell pepper" is sufficient. Let me think: when you're in the garden, the items are on the floor, so the command should be "take bell pepper." The previous attempt included "from floor," which might be redundant or incorrect. So the next action should be "take bell pepper."

Okay, the user is trying to put the bell pepper on the stove, but they're in the Backyard. The stove is in the Kitchen. They tried "put bell pepper on stove in kitchen" multiple times, but it's not working. Maybe they need to go to the kitchen first. Let me check the previous steps.

The user was in the Garden, took the bell pepper, then went north back to the Backyard. The stove is in the Kitchen, which is east of the Backyard via the screen door. So the correct steps would be: go east to the Kitchen, then put the bell pepper on the stove. But the user is currently in the Backyard and tried to put it in the kitchen without moving. The game says they can't see the stove here. So the next action should be to go east to the Kitchen first. Then, once in the Kitchen, put the bell pepper on the stove. The user needs to move to the correct location before attempting to put the item on the stove.
