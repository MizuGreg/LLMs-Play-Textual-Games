Welcome to TextWorld! First of all, you could, like, doublecheck that the chest drawer is opened. And then, retrieve the old key from the chest drawer inside the bedroom. After that, check that the wooden door is unlocked with the old key. After that, open the wooden door. And then, travel east. Once you manage that, open the refrigerator within the kitchen. Then, recover the bell pepper from the refrigerator. If you have picked up the bell pepper, place the bell pepper on the stove inside the kitchen. Got that? Good!

-= Bedroom =-
You've just sauntered into a bedroom.

You make out a closed chest drawer nearby. You make out a closed antique trunk, which looks standard, nearby. You can make out a king-size bed. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. What's the point of an empty king-size bed?

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me figure out what to do next. The user is in a text-based game where they need to follow specific steps to reach the goal. So far, they've opened the chest drawer and retrieved the old key. The next step mentioned was checking if the wooden door is unlocked with the old key. But the user tried to "retrieve old key from chest drawer" and the system didn't recognize it. Then they tried "pick up old key from chest drawer" which was understood partially.

Now, the user is asking if they're on the right track and what their next action should be. The previous steps were: open chest drawer, retrieve old key. The next step in the original instructions was to check the wooden door with the old key. So the next action should be to unlock the wooden door using the old key. The command would be "unlock wooden door with old key". But I need to make sure that's the correct command based on the game's context. Alternatively, maybe "use old key on wooden door" or "unlock door with old key". The game's previous responses used "open" and "retrieve", so maybe "unlock" is the right verb here. The user has the key, so using it on the door makes sense. The next step after unlocking the door is to open it, then go east, then proceed to the kitchen. So the next action should be to unlock the door with the key.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to progress in the TextWorld game. They started by opening the chest drawer and found an old key. Then they tried to retrieve the key, but the system didn't recognize it. After some back-and-forth, they tried to unlock the wooden door with the old key, but the system keeps saying they need to take the key first.

Hmm, maybe the issue is that the key is still in the chest drawer. The user might not have picked it up yet. Let me check the previous steps. The user opened the chest drawer, and the system said the old key was inside. Then the user tried to "retrieve old key from chest drawer," but the system didn't recognize it. Then they tried "pick up old key from chest drawer," which the system partially understood but said they only got as far as wanting to pick it up.

So maybe the key hasn't been actually picked up. The next step should be to pick up the key properly. Then, once the key is in inventory, they can unlock the door. The user is stuck because they're trying to unlock the door before taking the key. So the correct action now is to pick up the key again, making sure to use the correct command. The system might be expecting "take old key from chest drawer" or similar. But the user has already tried that. Wait, maybe the command is "take old key" without specifying the location, assuming it's in the chest drawer. Alternatively, maybe the key is already in hand, but the system is not recognizing it. This is a bit confusing. The user needs to ensure the key is in their inventory before attempting to unlock the door. So the next step is to pick up the key again, using the correct command. The system might be having trouble with the previous commands, so maybe the user needs to rephrase it. But according to the instructions, the assistant should only output the action. So the next action should be to pick up the key again, perhaps using "take old key" or "pick up old key." But the system previously said that "retrieve old key from chest drawer" wasn't recognized. So maybe the correct command is "take old key from chest drawer." Let me check the previous interactions. The user tried "retrieve old key from chest drawer," which the system didn't recognize. Then they tried "pick up old key from chest drawer," which the system said it only understood up to wanting to pick it up. So maybe the correct command is "take old key from chest drawer." But the system is not accepting it. Alternatively, maybe the key is already in hand, but the system isn't updating the inventory. In that case, the user should try unlocking the door again. But the system keeps saying they need to take the key first. So perhaps the key hasn't been picked up yet. The user needs to pick it up again. So the next action is to pick up the old key from the chest drawer. The correct command might be "take old key from chest drawer." But the user has already tried that. Maybe the system is expecting "take old key" without the location. Alternatively, maybe the key is already in the inventory, but the system isn't recognizing it. This is a bit tricky. The user's next action should be to pick up the key again, using the correct command. So the answer is "take old key from chest drawer."

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to progress through the game. They started in the bedroom, opened the chest drawer, retrieved the old key, and unlocked the wooden door. Then they tried to go east, but the game said they need to open the door first. So the next step should be to open the door after unlocking it.

Wait, the user just unlocked the door, right? The last action was unlocking the wooden door with the old key, which was successful. Then the user tried to go east, but the game said they have to open the door first. Maybe "open" and "unlock" are different actions here. Even though they unlocked it, the door might still be locked until they open it. So the correct next step is to open the door. Let me check the previous steps again.

Yes, the user unlocked the door, but the door might be locked until they open it. So the next action should be to open the wooden door. Then they can go east. So the next command should be "open wooden door".

You find yourself in a kitchen. A standard one. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

You can make out a refrigerator. You see a counter. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a stove. The stove appears to be empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You scan the room, seeing a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

Okay, let me think through this. The user is in the kitchen and just opened the refrigerator, finding a bell pepper. The goal was to retrieve the bell pepper, put it on the stove, and then maybe proceed further. So the next step would be to take the bell pepper from the fridge. Then, once it's picked up, place it on the stove. The user hasn't done that yet. The current score is 5/11, so they're on the right track. The next action should be to pick up the bell pepper.

Wait, the user just opened the fridge and saw the bell pepper. The command should be to take the bell pepper. But in the game's context, maybe the correct verb is "take" or "pick up". The previous action was "open refrigerator", so the next logical step is to retrieve the bell pepper. The user's last action was opening the fridge, so the next command should be to take the bell pepper from there. Then, after that, place it on the stove. So the next action is "take bell pepper from refrigerator" or similar. But the game might expect a specific command. Let me check the previous interactions. The user was told to "retrieve the old key" and "open the refrigerator within the kitchen. Then, recover the bell pepper from the refrigerator. If you have picked up the bell pepper, place the bell pepper on the stove inside the kitchen." So the correct sequence is: open fridge, take bell pepper, then place on stove. So the next action is to take the bell pepper. The user hasn't done that yet. So the answer should be "take bell pepper from refrigerator".
