Welcome to TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First thing I need you to do is to open the chest drawer within the bedroom. And then, retrieve the old key from the chest drawer within the bedroom. With the old key, insert the old key into the wooden door's lock to unlock it. After that, ensure that the wooden door is open. Then, try to go east. After that, open the refrigerator. After that, recover the tomato plant from the refrigerator. If you can get your hands on the tomato plant, sit the tomato plant on the stove in the kitchen. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Bedroom =-
You find yourself in a bedroom. An usual kind of place.

A closed chest drawer is in the room. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an antique trunk. Huh, weird. What's that over there? It looks like it's a king-size bed. The king-size bed is normal. But the thing is empty.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

<think>
Okay, let me see. The user is playing this text-based game called TextWorld. Their goal is to open a chest drawer in the bedroom, get an old key from it, use the key to unlock a wooden door, then go east, open a refrigerator, get a tomato plant, put it on the stove in the kitchen, and then stop.

So far, they've opened the chest drawer and retrieved the old key. The score is now 2 out of 3. The next step according to the original task was to insert the old key into the wooden door's lock to unlock it. The user tried "insert old key into wooden door's lock" but the system didn't recognize it. Then they tried "take old key from chest drawer" which worked. Now they need to use the key on the door.

Wait, the correct action here would be to use the key on the lock. In text adventures, the usual command is "use key on lock" or "unlock door with key". But the user might need to specify the exact phrasing. Since the previous attempt was "insert old key into wooden door's lock", which was invalid, maybe the correct command is "unlock wooden door with old key". Alternatively, "use old key on wooden door".

But looking at the previous interaction, when they tried "insert old key into wooden door's lock", the system said it's not a recognized verb. So maybe the correct command is "unlock wooden door" after taking the key. Or perhaps "use old key on lock". But the door is described as a wooden door leading east. So maybe the correct action is "unlock wooden door" using the key. Let me check the game's possible commands. Since the user has the key, they need to unlock the door. The correct command would be "unlock wooden door with old key" or "use old key to unlock wooden door". Alternatively, "insert old key into lock" if the lock is part of the door.

But in the previous step, the user tried "insert old key into wooden door's lock" and it was invalid. So maybe the correct command is "unlock wooden door" without specifying the key, but since the key is in hand, the game should recognize that. Alternatively, the user might need to use the key on the door's lock. So the next action should be "unlock wooden door" or "use old key on wooden door's lock".

Wait, the user's next action after retrieving the key is to insert it into the lock. The system might expect "use old key on lock" or "unlock door with old key". But the exact phrasing depends on the game's command set. Since the user previously tried "insert old key into wooden door's lock" and it was invalid, maybe the correct command is "unlock wooden door" because the key is already in hand. Let me think. The user has the key, so the next step is to unlock the door. The correct command would be "unlock wooden door" or "use old key on wooden door".

But the user's previous attempt was "insert old key into wooden door's lock", which was invalid. So perhaps the correct command is "unlock wooden door". Let me check the game's possible actions. In TextWorld, the standard way to unlock a door is to use the key on the lock. So the correct command would be "use old key on lock" or "unlock wooden door with old key".

Alternatively, the game might require "insert old key into lock" if the lock is part of the door. But since the door is described as "wooden door leading east", maybe the lock is part of the door. So the correct action is "insert old key into lock" or "unlock wooden door".

But the user tried "insert old key into wooden door's lock" and it was invalid. So maybe the correct command is "unlock wooden door". Let me proceed with that. The user needs to unlock the door, so the next action is "unlock wooden door".

Okay, let's see. The user is playing a text adventure game. Their goal is to open the chest drawer, get the old key, unlock the door, go east, open the fridge, get the tomato plant, put it on the stove, and then stop.

So far, they've opened the chest drawer, taken the old key, unlocked the door, and tried to go east. But when they tried to go east, the game said they had to open the wooden door first. Wait, but they just unlocked it. Maybe the door is locked again? Or maybe "unlock" isn't the right action here. Let me check the previous steps.

The user tried to unlock the door again, but the game responded that it's already unlocked. Hmm. Maybe the correct action is to "open" the door instead of "unlock"? Because sometimes in these games, you have to open a door that's locked, not just unlock it. But the door was previously closed, and they used the key to unlock it. Now it's unlocked, so maybe they need to "open" it to proceed.

Alternatively, maybe the door is locked, and even though they unlocked it, they need to open it. But the game message says "That's unlocked at the moment," so maybe the door is already unlocked. Then why can't they go east? Maybe the door is not open, just unlocked. So the next step would be to open the door. But how? Maybe the action is "open wooden door" instead of "unlock".

Wait, the user tried "unlock wooden door" again, but the game said it's already unlocked. So maybe the correct action is to "open wooden door" now. Let me think. The original task was to "insert the old key into the wooden door's lock to unlock it. After that, ensure that the wooden door is open." So after unlocking, they need to open it. So maybe the next step is to "open wooden door".

But the user tried that already? Or maybe the door is locked, and even though they unlocked it, they need to open it. So the correct action would be "open wooden door". Let me check the previous steps again.

The user had the key, unlocked the door, and then tried to go east, but the game said they had to open the door first. So maybe the door is locked again, and they need to unlock it again. But that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the door is unlocked but closed, so they need to open it. So the correct action is "open wooden door".

So the next action should be "open wooden door". Let me make sure. The user is in the bedroom, the door is east. They have the key, unlocked the door, but the door is still closed. So they need to open it. Therefore, the next command is "open wooden door".

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a refrigerator. You make out a counter. The counter is standard. The counter appears to be empty. You make out a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove! oh well. You can see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is normal. On the kitchen island you can see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

Okay, let me figure out what to do next. The user's goal is to retrieve the tomato plant from the refrigerator and put it on the stove. So far, they've opened the refrigerator and found the tomato plant and a half-bag of chips. The next step should be to take the tomato plant.

But wait, in the current room (Kitchen), the user has to interact with the refrigerator. Since the refrigerator is open, they need to take the tomato plant from there. The command would be "take tomato plant from refrigerator" or something similar. However, the system might expect a specific verb. Earlier, when they took the key, they used "take old key from chest drawer". So maybe the correct command here is "take tomato plant from refrigerator".

But looking at the previous interactions, when they opened the refrigerator, it revealed the tomato plant. So the next action should be to take it. The user's next input should be "take tomato plant from refrigerator". Then, after obtaining it, they can go to the stove and place it there. Let me check the previous commands again to ensure consistency. Yes, the user used "take" when retrieving the key. So the correct next action is to take the tomato plant from the refrigerator.
