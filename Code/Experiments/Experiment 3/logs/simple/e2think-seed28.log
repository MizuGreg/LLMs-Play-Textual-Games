Welcome to TextWorld! First of all, you could, like, doublecheck that the chest drawer is opened. And then, retrieve the old key from the chest drawer inside the bedroom. After that, check that the wooden door is unlocked with the old key. After that, open the wooden door. And then, travel east. Once you manage that, open the refrigerator within the kitchen. Then, recover the bell pepper from the refrigerator. If you have picked up the bell pepper, place the bell pepper on the stove inside the kitchen. Got that? Good!

-= Bedroom =-
You've just sauntered into a bedroom.

You make out a closed chest drawer nearby. You make out a closed antique trunk, which looks standard, nearby. You can make out a king-size bed. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. What's the point of an empty king-size bed?

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing a text-based game called TextWorld. The goal is to follow a series of steps to reach the original goal, which I assume is something like escaping or completing a quest. The user has already opened the chest drawer and retrieved the old key, but there was a mistake in the command.

First, the user tried "retrieve old key from chest drawer," but the system said that's not a recognized verb. So I need to figure out the correct command. In text adventures, common verbs are like 'take', 'get', 'open', 'use', etc. Since the key is in the chest drawer, the correct action would be to take the key. The previous step was opening the chest drawer, which revealed the key. So the next step should be taking the key.

But the user might have confused "retrieve" with "take." So the correct command here is "take old key." Alternatively, maybe "get old key." But in the game's context, the correct verb might be "take." Let me check the previous interaction. The user said "retrieve old key from chest drawer," which the system rejected. So the correct action is probably "take old key" without the "from chest drawer" part, since the key is already in the chest drawer after opening it. So the next action should be taking the key.

Then, after taking the key, the next step is to unlock the wooden door with the old key. So the user needs to use the key on the door. The command would be "unlock wooden door with old key" or "use old key on wooden door." But the game might expect "unlock wooden door" after using the key. Wait, the original instructions said to check that the wooden door is unlocked with the old key. So maybe the correct command is "unlock wooden door" using the key. But the exact command depends on the game's syntax.

Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "use old key on wooden door" to unlock it. But the user's previous action was retrieving the key, so after that, the next step is to unlock the door. So the correct command here is "unlock wooden door" using the key. However, the system might require the player to use the key first. So the next action after taking the key is to unlock the door.

But the user's last action was "retrieve old key from chest drawer," which was invalid. The correct command should be "take old key." Then, after taking the key, the next step is to unlock the door. So the user needs to take the key first. Therefore, the correct next action is "take old key."

Okay, let's see. The user has successfully opened the chest drawer, taken the old key, and unlocked the wooden door. The next step according to the original instructions was to open the wooden door. Wait, the user just unlocked it, so maybe the next step is to open it. But the game might consider unlocking and opening as separate actions. Alternatively, after unlocking, the door is open, so maybe the user needs to go through it.

But the original plan was: after unlocking, open the wooden door, then travel east. So the next action should be "open wooden door". But the user already unlocked it. Maybe the game requires opening it after unlocking. Alternatively, the door is now open because it's unlocked. So the next step is to go east through the door. The user is in the bedroom, and the door leads east. So the next command should be "go east".

But the user's last action was "unlock wooden door", and the score increased. The next step is to open the door, but maybe "open" is redundant if it's already unlocked. Alternatively, the door is now open, so the user can go through. So the correct command is "go east".

Okay, let's see. The user has opened the wooden door and moved east. The next step in the original plan was to go east, which they did. Now, the next part of the instructions was to open the refrigerator in the kitchen, then get the bell pepper, put it on the stove.

But the user is now in a new location after going east. The previous location was the bedroom, then they opened the door and went east. The next room might be the kitchen. So the next action should be to go into the kitchen. But the user needs to check if they're in the kitchen yet. Since the original plan says after opening the door, travel east, then go to the kitchen.

Wait, the user's last action was "open wooden door", which allowed them to go east. Now they're in the kitchen. The next step is to open the refrigerator. So the command should be "open refrigerator". But the user needs to make sure they're in the kitchen. Since the door led east to the kitchen, the next step is to open the fridge there.

So the correct next action is "open refrigerator".

You find yourself in a kitchen. A standard one. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

You can make out a refrigerator. You see a counter. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a stove. The stove appears to be empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You scan the room, seeing a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the kitchen now. The previous attempt to open the refrigerator failed, but the user tried "go east" again. Wait, the user just went east from the kitchen, but the kitchen's description says there's a closed screen door leading east, an open wooden door west, and an exit to the north. The user might have moved east into another room, but the refrigerator is in the kitchen. The original plan was to open the refrigerator in the kitchen, then get the bell pepper, put it on the stove.

Wait, the user's last action was "go east" from the kitchen, but the kitchen's east door is closed. So maybe the user tried to go east but couldn't. But the system's response shows that the user is now in the kitchen, and the next step is to open the refrigerator. The user tried "open refrigerator" but got a "can't see any such thing" response. So maybe the refrigerator is closed, and the user needs to open it. But the user tried "open refrigerator" and it didn't work. Wait, the kitchen description says the refrigerator is there, but maybe it's closed. The user needs to open it. So the correct command is "open refrigerator".

But the user tried that and got an error. Maybe the refrigerator is not in the current location. Wait, the kitchen description says "You can make out a refrigerator." So it's there. Maybe the user needs to use the correct verb. In text adventures, sometimes you have to use "open" or "use" to open things. But the user tried "open refrigerator" and it didn't work. Maybe the correct command is "open fridge" instead. Or maybe the user needs to check the refrigerator's state. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go to the refrigerator's location again. But the user is already in the kitchen. So perhaps the correct action is "open refrigerator" again, but the game says it's not there. Wait, the user's previous attempt was "open refrigerator" and the response was "You can't see any such thing." That's confusing because the kitchen description says the refrigerator is there. Maybe there's a typo or a mistake in the game's response. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use a different command. But according to the game's rules, the correct action is to open the refrigerator. So the next step is to try "open refrigerator" again, even though the system says it's not there. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check the kitchen again. But the user is already in the kitchen. So the correct next action is "open refrigerator".

Okay, the user has taken the bell pepper from the refrigerator. The next step according to the original plan was to place the bell pepper on the stove inside the kitchen. So the current location is the kitchen, and the stove is mentioned in the kitchen description. The user needs to go to the stove and put the bell pepper there.

But the user is currently holding the bell pepper. The command would be to go to the stove. However, the kitchen description mentions a stove that's empty. So the user needs to go to the stove's location. The previous actions were in the kitchen, so the next step is to go to the stove. But the user might need to use the correct command. In text adventures, the command would be "go to stove" or "go to the stove". Alternatively, since the stove is in the kitchen, maybe the user can just put the bell pepper on it directly.

But the correct command would be "put bell pepper on stove". However, the user needs to make sure they're in the right place. Since the stove is in the kitchen, and the user is already there, the command should be "put bell pepper on stove". Let me check the previous steps. The user took the bell pepper, so now they need to place it on the stove. The correct command is "put bell pepper on stove".
