It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to open the antique trunk. After pulling open the antique trunk, pick up the old key from the antique trunk. Then, unlock the wooden door with the old key. And then, open the wooden door in the bedroom. Then, try to take a trip east. That done, open the refrigerator. And then, recover the apple from the refrigerator. After that, sit the apple on the stove within the kitchen. Alright, thanks!

-= Bedroom =-
You're now in a bedroom.

You can see a closed chest drawer. You see a closed antique trunk here. Were you looking for a king-size bed? Because look over there, it's a king-size bed. Now why would someone leave that there? The king-size bed appears to be empty.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me think through the user's current situation. They're in the bedroom of the TextWorld game. The previous steps were opening the antique trunk, picking up the old key, and now they need to use that key to unlock the wooden door.

First, the user has already collected the old key from the trunk. The next step according to the initial instructions was to unlock the wooden door with the old key. So the next logical action is to try unlocking the door. The door is described as closed and leading east, so the command should be "unlock wooden door" using the key. 

Wait, but in the game's context, do I need to specify the key? The previous action was "pick up old key", so the key is now in the player's inventory. The command would be to unlock the door with the key. However, the game might require the exact phrasing. The user's previous actions were "open antique trunk" and "pick up old key". The next step is to unlock the wooden door. The correct command here is "unlock wooden door" since the key is already picked up. The game's response after unlocking would then allow opening the door. 

The user's current score is 2/3, so they need to proceed to the next step. The next action should be to unlock the door. So the answer is "unlock wooden door".

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps to open the antique trunk, get the key, unlock and open the wooden door. Now they're in the bedroom, having opened the door. The next step according to the initial instructions was to "try to take a trip east." So after opening the door, the next logical step would be to move east. But wait, the user just opened the wooden door, so maybe they're now in the next room. The instruction says to "try to take a trip east," which might mean moving east from the current location. However, the previous action was opening the wooden door, which leads east. So the next step would be to go east. But the user has to check if they can move east now. Since the door was closed before and now it's open, moving east is possible. So the next command should be "go east." But the user's last action was opening the door, so perhaps they are now in the east room. The original goal was to recover the apple from the refrigerator, so maybe after moving east, they'll find the refrigerator. But the user's next action should be "go east" to proceed.

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen.

You can see a closed refrigerator. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. The counter is usual. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a stove. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is typical. On the kitchen island you can see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps to unlock the door, open the wooden door, go east to the kitchen, and now they've opened the refrigerator. The refrigerator had a tomato plant and an apple. The next step in the original plan was to recover the apple from the refrigerator, which they just did. Then they needed to sit the apple on the stove within the kitchen.

So the current location is the kitchen. The user has the apple, so the next action should be to take the apple. Wait, but in the game, you have to pick up items. The refrigerator was opened, and inside are the tomato plant and apple. So the user needs to pick up the apple. The command would be "take apple" or "pick up apple". But the game might require the exact command. Let me check the previous actions. Earlier, they "pick up old key" when they took it from the trunk. So maybe "take apple" is the correct command here. Alternatively, "pick up apple". But the system message says to only output the action, like "go north". So the correct command here is "take apple" or "pick up apple". Let me check the game's possible commands. Since the user is in the kitchen, after opening the refrigerator, the apple is there. So the next step is to take the apple. The correct command would be "take apple".
