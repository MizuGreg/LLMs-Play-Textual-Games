You are now playing a exciting game of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First stop, assure that the chest drawer in the bedroom is wide open. And then, pick up the old key from the chest drawer inside the bedroom. Then, check that the wooden door is unlocked with the old key. After unlocking the wooden door, assure that the wooden door is wide open. After that, head east. Then, ensure that the screen door in the kitchen is open. Then, make an attempt to move east. With that accomplished, make an attempt to head south. Then, pick-up the lettuce from the floor of the garden. Then, travel north. Then, try to take a trip west. Then, rest the lettuce on the stove inside the kitchen. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Bedroom =-
You arrive in a bedroom. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You make out a chest drawer. What's that over there? It looks like it's an antique trunk. Were you looking for a king-size bed? Because look over there, it's a king-size bed. The king-size bed is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps in the game. They started in the bedroom, opened the chest drawer, picked up the old key, unlocked the wooden door, and opened it. Now they're in the bedroom, and the next step according to the original task was to head east. But the user is asking if they're on the right track and if they're close to the goal.

First, I need to check if the current actions align with the task. The task said after opening the door, they should head east. So the next logical step is to move east. The user is in the bedroom, and the wooden door was leading east. After opening it, they should go through it. The next action should be "go east" to move into the next room, which is probably the kitchen as per the later steps. 

The user's score is at 4/5, so they have a few more steps to go. The next steps after heading east would be to check the screen door in the kitchen, then try to move east and south, pick up lettuce, etc. So yes, the current actions are correct. The next step is to go east through the opened door. The user hasn't done that yet, so the next command should be "go east".

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.

You see a closed refrigerator. What's that over there? It looks like it's a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is ordinary. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. What's the point of an empty counter? You can see a stove. The stove is usual. The stove appears to be empty. You see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is standard. On the kitchen island you make out a note. Hmmm... what else, what else?

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

-= Backyard =-
You're now in the backyard. You begin looking for stuff.

You make out a set of chairs. The set of chairs is ordinary. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? Oh, great. Here's a bbq. The bbq appears to be empty. Hm. Oh well Look over there! a patio table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the patio table.

There is an open screen door leading west. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps given in the original task. They started in the bedroom, opened the chest drawer, picked up the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, then went east to the kitchen. Then they tried to go east again but had to open the screen door first. They did that, and now they're in the backyard.

The next step according to the original plan was to travel north after trying to move east and south. But in the current scenario, they're in the backyard. The user's next action should be to try moving north from the backyard. The backyard has a screen door leading west and a south exit that's unguarded. The prompt mentions trying to go north, so the correct command here would be "go north". Let me check the previous steps to ensure consistency. Yes, the user was instructed to travel north after handling the east and south attempts. So the next action is "go north".

You can't go that way.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps in the game. They started in the bedroom, opened the chest drawer, picked up the key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, then went east to the kitchen. They opened the screen door, went east to the backyard, then north to the garden where they picked up the lettuce. Now they're back in the backyard.

The next step in the original task was to travel north after picking up the lettuce. But after picking up the lettuce, they went north to the backyard again. Now, the next step according to the original instructions was to try to take a trip west. But in the current location (backyard), there's an open screen door leading west. So the next action should be to go west. But the user might need to check if that's the correct direction. Alternatively, maybe they need to go south again? Wait, the original steps said after picking up the lettuce, travel north, then try to take a trip west. So after going north to the backyard, the next step is to go west. But the user is currently in the backyard, so going west would be the next step. However, the user's last action was going north from the garden to the backyard. Now, the next action should be to go west. But the user might have to check if that's possible. The current location is the backyard, and the screen door west is open. So the correct command is "go west".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to rest the lettuce on the stove in the kitchen. But the game says that's not a recognized verb. Hmm, maybe the correct command is different. Let me think about the possible actions here.

In text adventures, sometimes you have to use specific verbs. The user has the lettuce in hand. The stove is in the kitchen. So maybe the correct action is "put lettuce on stove" instead of "rest". But "rest" isn't a valid verb here. Alternatively, maybe "place" is the correct verb. Let me check the previous commands. The user tried "rest lettuce on stove" three times, but it's not working. 

Wait, maybe the game expects "put" as the verb. So the correct command would be "put lettuce on stove". Let me try that. But the user has to input the exact command. Since "rest" isn't working, perhaps the correct verb is "put". So the next action should be "put lettuce on stove". But the user might not have tried that yet. Alternatively, maybe "place" is the correct verb. Let me think. In many text games, "put" is the standard verb for placing items. So the correct command is likely "put lettuce on stove". The user needs to use that instead of "rest".
