I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is how to play! First, it would be great if you could ensure that the chest drawer within the bedroom is open. And then, retrieve the old key from the chest drawer. And then, unlock the wooden door with the old key. And then, ensure that the wooden door within the bedroom is open. And then, make an attempt to go east. And then, open the screen door. After opening the screen door, make an effort to go to the east. Then, take a trip south. And then, retrieve the bell pepper from the floor of the garden. If you can get your hands on the bell pepper, head north. Then, travel west. After that, rest the bell pepper on the stove. Got that? Good!

-= Bedroom =-
You're now in the bedroom. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You can make out a chest drawer. You can see a closed antique trunk. You make out a king-size bed. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Hm. Oh well

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

You've just sauntered into a kitchen.

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a refrigerator. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a counter. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. You make out a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. The stove is ordinary. The stove appears to be empty. You can see a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this TextWorld game and has followed a set of instructions to reach certain points. So far, they've opened the chest drawer, retrieved the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, went east to the kitchen, opened the screen door, and now they're in the kitchen. The current score is 7 out of whatever the total is.

The user is asking if they're making the right actions and if they're close to the goal. The original goal mentioned earlier was to retrieve the bell pepper from the garden, rest it on the stove, and probably proceed further. But in the current kitchen, the next steps according to the initial instructions were to go east again after opening the screen door, then take a trip south, retrieve the bell pepper from the garden, head north, travel west, and rest the bell pepper on the stove.

Wait, but in the kitchen, the user just opened the screen door. The next step in the original plan was to go east again. However, in the kitchen description, there's a screen door leading east (which they just opened) and an open wooden door leading west. Also, there's an exit to the south. The user is at the kitchen now, after opening the screen door. The next action according to the initial plan was to go east again. But maybe they need to check if the screen door is open and then proceed east. However, the user just opened the screen door, so the next step would be to go east through it. But in the kitchen, the screen door is east, so going east would lead to another area. However, the initial instructions said after opening the screen door, make an effort to go to the east. So the next action should be "go east".

But the user is in the kitchen, and the screen door is east. So going east would be the next step. However, the user might need to check if that's the correct direction. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go south from the kitchen. But according to the original plan, after opening the screen door, they should go east. So the next action is "go east".

-= Backyard =-
If you're wondering why everything seems so ordinary all of a sudden, it's because you've just walked into the backyard. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You can see a set of chairs. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a set of chairs, go to TextWorld. The set of chairs is usual. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You see a bbq. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You swear loudly. You can see a patio table. Now why would someone leave that there? But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.

There is an open screen door leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

Okay, the user is stuck in the Garden scene. They tried to take the bell pepper from the floor multiple times, but it's not working. Let me check the game state again.

In the Garden description, it says there's a half of a bag of chips, an apple, a bell pepper, and a shovel on the floor. Wait, maybe the bell pepper is not visible because it's under something else? Or maybe the user needs to use a different verb. The previous attempts used "take bell pepper from floor", but the game says "You can't see any such thing." Maybe the bell pepper is not on the floor but somewhere else? Or perhaps the correct command is just "take bell pepper" without specifying the floor. Let me check the available actions. The user is in the Garden, and the objects are on the floor. Maybe the correct command is "take bell pepper" instead of specifying the floor. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to look around again. But the game says "You can't see any such thing," so maybe the bell pepper is not there. Wait, the initial instruction said to retrieve the bell pepper from the floor of the garden. But in the current scene, the garden has the bell pepper on the floor. Maybe the game is not recognizing it because the user is using the wrong command. Let me think of possible commands. Maybe "get bell pepper" or "pick up bell pepper". The previous attempts used "take bell pepper from floor", but the game doesn't recognize it. Maybe the correct command is just "take bell pepper" without the "from floor" part. Let me try that. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check if the bell pepper is actually present. But according to the game description, it is there. So perhaps the correct command is "take bell pepper". Let me try that.

In the Garden, the objects mentioned are a half of a bag of chips, an apple, and a shovel on the floor. The stove wasn't mentioned here. Earlier, in the Kitchen, the stove was present. So maybe the stove is in the Kitchen, and the user is now in the Garden. Wait, the user picked up the bell pepper in the Garden and now wants to put it on the stove. But the stove is in the Kitchen. So the user needs to go back to the Kitchen to put the bell pepper on the stove. The current location is the Garden, so the next step is to go north back to the Kitchen. Then, in the Kitchen, they can put the bell pepper on the stove. But the user is in the Garden, so the correct command is "go north" to return to the Kitchen. Then, in the Kitchen, they can use "put bell pepper on stove". But the user is currently in the Garden, so the next action should be to go north.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, the user is stuck in the Backyard and keeps trying to go north, but it's not possible. They need to find another way to reach the Kitchen where the stove is. Let me check the available exits in the Backyard. The Backyard has an open screen door leading west and an unblocked exit to the south. The user was coming from the Garden, so maybe they should go south back to the Kitchen. Wait, earlier when they went south from the Garden, they ended up in the Backyard. So perhaps the correct path is to go south from the Backyard to return to the Kitchen. Let me confirm the exits again. The Backyard has a screen door west and a south exit. So the user should try going south to get back to the Kitchen. Then, once in the Kitchen, they can put the bell pepper on the stove. So the next action should be "go south".

-= Garden =-
You find yourself in a garden. A typical one.



There is an unblocked exit to the north.

There is a half of a bag of chips, an apple and a shovel on the floor.

Okay, the user is stuck again. They tried to put the bell pepper on the stove but can't see the stove. Let me check the game state. The user is in the Garden, and the objects there are a half bag of chips, an apple, and a shovel. The stove wasn't mentioned here. Earlier, in the Kitchen, the stove was present. So the user must be in the Garden, not the Kitchen. The correct action is to go back to the Kitchen. But how? The user was in the Garden, and the exit to the north leads back to the Backyard. Wait, earlier when they went north from the Garden, they ended up in the Backyard. Then, going south from the Backyard brings them back to the Garden. So maybe the user needs to go back to the Kitchen through the Backyard. But the user is in the Garden, so they need to go north to the Backyard, then find the exit to the Kitchen. Wait, the Backyard has an open screen door leading west and an exit to the south. Maybe the Kitchen is connected via the screen door. Alternatively, the user might have to go west from the Backyard. Let me think. The user is in the Garden, then went north to Backyard, then tried to go north again but couldn't. Then they went south back to Garden. So maybe the correct path is to go west from the Backyard. But the Backyard's description says there's an open screen door leading west. So the user should go west from the Backyard to reach the Kitchen. But the user is currently in the Garden. So the steps are: from Garden, go north to Backyard, then go west to Kitchen. Then, in the Kitchen, put the bell pepper on the stove. But the user is in the Garden again. So the next action should be to go north to Backyard, then west to Kitchen. But the user is in the Garden, so first go north to Backyard. Then, in Backyard, go west to Kitchen. Then, in Kitchen, put the bell pepper on the stove. So the current location is Garden. The next step is to go north to Backyard. Then, from Backyard, go west to Kitchen. Then, in Kitchen, put the bell pepper on the stove. But the user is in Garden, so first action is "go north".

-= Backyard =-
If you're wondering why everything seems so ordinary all of a sudden, it's because you've just walked into the backyard. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You can see a set of chairs. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a set of chairs, go to TextWorld. The set of chairs is usual. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You see a bbq. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You swear loudly. You can see a patio table. Now why would someone leave that there? But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.

There is an open screen door leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

-= Kitchen =-
You've just sauntered into a kitchen.

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a refrigerator. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a counter. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. You make out a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. The stove is ordinary. The stove appears to be empty. You can see a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.
