Welcome to another profound episode of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First, it would be good if you could ensure that the chest drawer in the bedroom is open. Then, take the old key from the chest drawer. And then, make it so that the wooden door in the bedroom is unlocked with the old key. After that, ensure that the wooden door inside the bedroom is open. Then, go east. That done, ensure that the screen door in the kitchen is open. After pulling open the screen door, travel east. Then, move south. And then, retrieve the milk from the floor of the garden. Then, try to go to the north. Following that, move west. With that done, sit the milk on the stove. That's it!

-= Bedroom =-
You are in a bedroom. A normal kind of place.

You scan the room for a chest drawer, and you find a chest drawer. You can see an antique trunk. You make out a king-size bed. The king-size bed is ordinary. However, the king-size bed, like an empty king-size bed, has nothing on it.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps given in the initial instructions. They started by opening the chest drawer in the bedroom, took the old key, and now they need to unlock the wooden door in the bedroom with that key. The next step according to the original plan was to make sure the wooden door is unlocked and then open it. So the next action should be to unlock the door with the old key. The user has already taken the key, so now they need to use it on the door. The command would be "unlock wooden door with old key" or something similar. But the exact phrasing might matter. Let me check the previous commands. The user was told to "make it so that the wooden door in the bedroom is unlocked with the old key." So the correct command here is likely "unlock wooden door with old key". That's the next step.

Okay, the user has successfully opened the wooden door in the bedroom after unlocking it. The next step according to the original plan was to go east. So the next action should be "go east". The user has to move east from the bedroom. Let me make sure that's the next step. The original instructions said after opening the wooden door, go east. Then, in the kitchen, open the screen door, go east, move south, get the milk, go north, west, and then sit the milk on the stove. So yes, "go east" is the next correct command here.
</think>go east
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Kitchen =-
You've just walked into a kitchen. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You can make out a refrigerator. Hey, want to see a counter? Look over there, a counter. The counter is standard. But the thing is empty. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You scan the room, seeing a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

-= Backyard =-
You arrive in a backyard. An ordinary one.

You can make out a set of chairs. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You see a bbq. The bbq appears to be empty. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You can make out a patio table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The patio table appears to be empty.

There is an open screen door leading west. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

Okay, the user tried to move south but the game responded with "You must name something more substantial." So the previous action "move south" was invalid. The user needs to find another way to proceed. Let me check the environment again. In the Backyard, there's an open screen door west and an unguarded exit south. But moving south might not be possible without a valid command. Maybe the correct action is to "go south" instead of "move south"? Or perhaps there's another object to interact with. The user needs to follow the original plan: after going east in the kitchen, they should move south. But the game is prompting for a more substantial action. Maybe the user needs to interact with the patio table or chairs? But the original plan was to go south. Wait, the user's previous action was "move south" which was invalid. The correct command might be "go south" instead. Let me try that.
</think>go south
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Garden =-
You arrive in a garden. A normal kind of place.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a lettuce, a milk, a half of a bag of chips and a shovel on the floor.

Okay, the user tried to "retrieve milk from floor" but the game said that's not a recognized verb. So I need to figure out the correct command. The milk is on the floor in the garden. The possible actions here might be "take milk" or "get milk". Since the user was told to "retrieve the milk from the floor of the garden", the correct command is likely "take milk". Let me check previous commands. The user was told to "retrieve the milk", so "take milk" is the right action here.

The next step according to the original instructions was "Following that, move west. With that done, sit the milk on the stove." So after moving west, they need to sit the milk on the stove. But first, they need to move west. The current location is the Backyard, and the screen door is open leading west. So the next action should be "go west". Let me check the previous steps. The user was told to "move west" after going north. So "go west" is the correct command here.

Okay, the user tried to "sit milk on stove" but the game said they didn't understand that sentence. So I need to figure out the correct command. The milk is in the user's inventory, and they need to place it on the stove. The correct action here is likely "put milk on stove". Let me check previous commands. The user was told to "sit the milk on the stove", but the game might expect "put" instead of "sit". So the right command is "put milk on stove".
