Welcome to TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, you could, like, open the chest drawer. Then, pick up the old key from the chest drawer. After picking up the old key, assure that the wooden door is unlocked. Then, ensure that the wooden door is open. After pulling open the wooden door, take a trip east. And then, make sure that the screen door is wide open. After that, make an effort to move east. With that done, attempt to take a trip south. Then, pick-up the bell pepper from the floor of the garden. And then, attempt to go to the north. If you can succeed at that, make an effort to take a trip west. And then, rest the bell pepper on the stove. Got that? Good!

-= Bedroom =-
You are in a bedroom. A standard kind of place.

You can make out a chest drawer. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You see a closed antique trunk close by. Look over there! a king-size bed. The king-size bed appears to be empty.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. A standard one.

You see a refrigerator. You check the price tag that's still affixed to the refrigerator. 100 bucks? What a deal! You'll have to ask where they got this! You see a counter. The counter is typical. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. Look over there! a kitchen island. You wonder idly who left that here. The kitchen island is usual. On the kitchen island you see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Backyard =-
You've entered a backyard. You can barely contain your excitement.

You scan the room for a set of chairs, and you find a set of chairs! The set of chairs is typical. But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? What's that over there? It looks like it's a bbq. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a bbq, go to TextWorld. However, the bbq, like an empty bbq, has nothing on it. You can see a patio table. The patio table is normal. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

There is an open screen door leading west. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what the next step should be. The user has been following the instructions given in the initial task. Let me recap the steps to make sure I don't miss anything.

The original task was: open the chest drawer, pick up the old key, unlock the wooden door, open the wooden door, go east, open the screen door, go east again, then go south, pick up the bell pepper from the garden, go north, then west, and rest the bell pepper on the stove.

So far, the user has done the following:

1. Opened the chest drawer (done)
2. Picked up the old key (done)
3. Unlocked the wooden door (done)
4. Opened the wooden door (done)
5. Gone east to the kitchen (done)
6. Opened the screen door (done)
7. Gone east again to the backyard (done)

Now, the next step according to the task is to "attempt to take a trip south" from the backyard. But in the current location (backyard), the user is told that there's an open screen door leading west and a south exit that's unguarded. So, the next logical step would be to go south from the backyard.

Wait, but in the backyard description, the user is told: "You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south." So the user is in the backyard, and the next step is to go south. That would take them back to the kitchen, perhaps? Or maybe another area. But according to the task, after opening the screen door and going east (to backyard), the next step is to attempt to go south. So the user should go south from the backyard.

But the user's last action was going east to the backyard. Now, they need to go south from there. So the next command should be "go south".

But let me check the current location. The user is in the backyard, and the description says there's an open screen door west and a south exit. So going south is possible. Therefore, the next action is "go south".

-= Garden =-
I am so happy to announce that you are now in the garden. You begin to take stock of what's here.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked.

There is a half of a bag of chips, a bell pepper, an apple and a shovel on the floor.
