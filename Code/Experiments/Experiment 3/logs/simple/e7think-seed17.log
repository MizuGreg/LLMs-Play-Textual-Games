Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, you could, like, ensure that the chest drawer is open. And then, take the old key from the chest drawer inside the bedroom. With the old key, doublecheck that the wooden door is unlocked. And then, open the wooden door within the bedroom. Then, attempt to go east. Then, make absolutely sure that the screen door inside the kitchen is opened. And then, attempt to venture east. Next, travel south. And then, lift the half of a bag of chips from the floor of the garden. Then, make an effort to move north. If you can finish that, venture west. And then, rest the half of a bag of chips on the stove. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Bedroom =-
You've just sauntered into a bedroom. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

You can see a chest drawer. You can see an antique trunk. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You see a king-size bed. The king-size bed is usual. The king-size bed appears to be empty.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

You arrive in a kitchen. An usual kind of place.

You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a refrigerator. Hmmm... what else, what else? You smell an intriguing smell, and follow it to a counter. The counter is standard. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You see a stove. The stove is ordinary. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is ordinary. On the kitchen island you see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what the next step should be. The user has been following a series of actions in the TextWorld game. Let me recap the current state.

Starting from the bedroom, they opened the chest drawer, took the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door east, which led them to the kitchen. Then they opened the screen door east in the kitchen. Now, the user is in the kitchen, and the next part of the original task was to "attempt to venture east" after opening the screen door. But the user just opened the screen door, so maybe the next step is to go east from the kitchen.

Looking at the kitchen description, there's a screen door leading east that's now open. The user is in the kitchen, and after opening the screen door, the next logical step would be to go through it. The original task mentioned after opening the screen door, they should attempt to venture east. So the command should be "go east".

But wait, in the previous step, the user was in the kitchen and opened the screen door. The current location is the kitchen, and the screen door is now open. So the next action is to go east through that door. The user's next command should be "go east".

-= Backyard =-
You find yourself in a backyard. A typical one. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

You see a set of chairs. The set of chairs appears to be empty. You move on, clearly depressed by your TextWorld experience. You see a bbq. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a patio table. The patio table is normal. But the thing is empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the patio table.

There is an open screen door leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is stuck in the Garden area. The task was to take the half of a bag of chips from the floor. But every time they try, it says "You can't see any such thing." Wait, looking back at the Garden description: "There is an apple, a lettuce, a half of a bag of chips and a shovel on the floor." So the chips are there. Maybe the user is trying to take it but the command isn't correct. The correct command should be "take half of a bag of chips from floor" but maybe the game expects a different phrasing. Alternatively, maybe the chips are just on the floor, so "take half of a bag of chips" without specifying the floor. But the previous attempts showed that the user tried "take half of a bag of chips from floor" and it didn't work. Wait, maybe the game is case-sensitive? Let me check the exact wording. The description says "a half of a bag of chips" with a capital "H" in "half". The user's command is "half of a bag of chips" with lowercase "half". Maybe the game expects the exact wording. So the correct command should be "take half of a bag of chips from floor" with the capital "H". But the user has been using lowercase "half" and it's not working. So the next step is to correct the command to use "half" with a capital letter. Alternatively, maybe the game is expecting "take half of a bag of chips" without specifying the floor, but the description does mention it's on the floor. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to first check the floor items. But the user already saw the items. Wait, the user's last action was trying to take the chips again, but it's not working. So the correct command should be "take half of a bag of chips" with the correct capitalization. Let me check the exact wording again. The Garden description says "a half of a bag of chips" with a capital "H". So the command should be "take half of a bag of chips from floor" with the capital "H". The user has been using lowercase "half", which might be why it's not working. So the next action should be to take the chips with the correct capitalization.

Okay, the user is stuck in the Garden area. The task is to take the half of a bag of chips from the floor. But every time they try, it says "You can't see any such thing." Let me check the Garden description again. The description says: "There is an apple, a lettuce, a half of a bag of chips and a shovel on the floor." So the chips are indeed there. The user has been using the command "take half of a bag of chips from floor" multiple times, but it's not working. Maybe the issue is with the capitalization. The description says "half of a bag of chips" with a capital "H", but the user's command uses lowercase "half". Let me try changing that. The correct command should be "take Half of a bag of chips from floor" with the capital H. Alternatively, maybe the game expects just "take half of a bag of chips" without specifying the floor, but the description does mention it's on the floor. Another possibility is that the user needs to first check the floor items. But the user already saw the items. Wait, maybe the game is case-sensitive and the correct command is "take half of a bag of chips" without the "from floor" part. Let me try that. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use "pick up" instead of "take". But the previous commands used "take". Hmm. The user has tried "take half of a bag of chips from floor" multiple times, but it's not working. Maybe the game is expecting a different phrasing. Let me think of other possible commands. Maybe "get half of a bag of chips" or "pick up half of a bag of chips". But the user's previous attempts used "take". Alternatively, maybe the chips are not on the floor but somewhere else. But the description clearly states they are on the floor. I'm confused. The user needs to take the chips, but the game isn't recognizing it. Maybe the correct command is "take half of a bag of chips" without the "from floor" part. Let me try that.

The stove is mentioned as "the stove is ordinary. But the thing hasn't got anything on it." So the stove is there, but empty. The user has the chips in hand. The correct command should be "put half of a bag of chips on stove". But the game says "You can't see any such thing." Maybe the stove isn't named "stove" but something else. Wait, in the Kitchen description, the stove is mentioned as "stove". But in the Garden, maybe the stove is called something different. Wait, no, the Garden description doesn't mention a stove. Wait, looking back: in the Garden, the items are apple, lettuce, half of a bag of chips, and a shovel. The stove is in the kitchen. Wait, the user is in the Garden now. How did they get here? Previously, they went from the Kitchen to the Backyard, then to the Garden. The stove is in the Kitchen. So maybe the user is in the Garden, but the stove is in the Kitchen. So putting the chips on the stove in the Garden is impossible. Wait, but the original task said "rest the half of a bag of chips on the stove." So the stove must be in the Garden. But according to the Garden description, there's no stove. Wait, maybe there's a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go back to the Kitchen to put the chips on the stove. But the user is in the Garden. So the correct action is to go back to the Kitchen, then put the chips on the stove. But the user is stuck in the Garden. So the next step is to go north to the Kitchen. Then, in the Kitchen, put the chips on the stove. But the user is in the Garden. So the correct command is "go north" to return to the Kitchen. Then, in the Kitchen, "put half of a bag of chips on stove". But the user is in the Garden. So the next action should be to go north. But the user is in the Garden, and the Garden has an exit to the north. So the correct command is "go north" to return to the Kitchen, then put the chips on the stove. But the user is currently in the Garden, so the next step is to go north.

-= Backyard =-
You find yourself in a backyard. A typical one. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

You see a set of chairs. The set of chairs appears to be empty. You move on, clearly depressed by your TextWorld experience. You see a bbq. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a patio table. The patio table is normal. But the thing is empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the patio table.

There is an open screen door leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. An usual kind of place.

You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a refrigerator. Hmmm... what else, what else? You smell an intriguing smell, and follow it to a counter. The counter is standard. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You see a stove. The stove is ordinary. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is ordinary. On the kitchen island you see a note.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.
