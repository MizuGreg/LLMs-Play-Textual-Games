I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is how to play! First, it would be great if you could ensure that the chest drawer within the bedroom is open. And then, retrieve the old key from the chest drawer. And then, unlock the wooden door with the old key. And then, ensure that the wooden door within the bedroom is open. And then, make an attempt to go east. And then, open the screen door. After opening the screen door, make an effort to go to the east. Then, take a trip south. And then, retrieve the bell pepper from the floor of the garden. If you can get your hands on the bell pepper, head north. Then, travel west. After that, rest the bell pepper on the stove. Got that? Good!

-= Bedroom =-
You're now in the bedroom. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You can make out a chest drawer. You can see a closed antique trunk. You make out a king-size bed. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Hm. Oh well

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing a text adventure game called TextWorld. They've been given a series of steps to follow. Let me recap what's happened so far.

First, they entered the bedroom and were told to open the chest drawer. They did that, found an old key. Then they tried to retrieve the key from the chest drawer, but the system said that's not a recognized verb. So maybe the key is already in the chest drawer after opening it. The user might have misunderstood the steps.

The original instructions said: open the chest drawer, retrieve the old key from the chest drawer, then unlock the wooden door with the key. But after opening the drawer, the key is inside. So the next step should be to take the key. But the user tried "retrieve old key from chest drawer", which the game didn't recognize. Maybe the correct verb is "take" instead of "retrieve". Or maybe the key is already in the chest drawer, so the user needs to pick it up.

Looking at the game's response after opening the drawer: "You open the chest drawer, revealing an old key." So the key is now in the chest drawer. The next step should be to take the key. The user tried "retrieve", which isn't a valid command. So the correct action is "take old key from chest drawer" or just "take old key".

But the game might have specific verbs. In many text adventures, "take" is the verb. So the user should use "take old key from chest drawer". But the system said "That's not a verb I recognise." So maybe the correct command is "take old key".

Alternatively, maybe after opening the drawer, the key is already in the inventory, so the user needs to pick it up. But the game's response didn't mention the key being picked up. So the user needs to take it.

So the next action should be "take old key from chest drawer" or "take old key". Since the game didn't recognize "retrieve", the correct verb is "take". Therefore, the next command is "take old key from chest drawer".

Okay, let's see. The user is playing a text adventure game called TextWorld. Their goal seems to be to follow a series of steps to reach the original goal, which isn't explicitly stated but probably involves collecting items and navigating through rooms.

So far, the user has opened the chest drawer, retrieved the old key, unlocked the wooden door, and the score has increased each time. The next step in the original instructions was to ensure the wooden door is open, which they just did by unlocking it. Then they were supposed to attempt to go east. The user's next action should be to go east.

But wait, after unlocking the door, the next step in the user's plan was to "ensure that the wooden door within the bedroom is open." Since they just unlocked it, maybe they need to check if it's open. But in the game, unlocking usually opens it. However, the user might need to explicitly open it. But the previous action was unlocking, which might have already opened it. The next step in the original instructions was to "make an attempt to go east." So the user should try to go east from the bedroom.

But the current location is the bedroom, and the wooden door leads east. So after unlocking, the user can try to go east. The next command should be "go east." But the user's previous action was "unlock wooden door with old key," and the response was "You unlock wooden door." Then the next step is to go east. So the correct next action is "go east." The user's next input should be "go east."

Okay, let's see. The user is playing a text-based game called TextWorld. The goal seems to be to follow a series of steps to reach the original goal, which isn't explicitly stated but probably involves collecting items and navigating through rooms.

So far, the player has opened the chest drawer, retrieved the old key, unlocked the wooden door, and opened it. The next step in the original instructions was to "make an attempt to go east" after ensuring the door is open. The user tried going east but was told they had to open the door first, which they did. Now, after opening the door, the next logical step would be to go east.

The current room is the bedroom, and after opening the wooden door leading east, the player should move east to enter the next room. The next step in the original plan was to open the screen door, but that might be in a different room. However, the user's last action was going east, which might have led them to a new room where they can interact with the screen door. But according to the latest prompt, the user is in the bedroom, having opened the door, and the next action should be to go east. So the correct command here is "go east".

You've just sauntered into a kitchen.

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a refrigerator. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a counter. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. You make out a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. The stove is ordinary. The stove appears to be empty. You can see a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this TextWorld game and has been following a set of instructions. The original goal was to retrieve the bell pepper from the garden and then do some actions involving the stove. So far, they've navigated through the bedroom, unlocked the door, went east to the kitchen, then north to the bathroom. Now they're in the bathroom, and the next step according to the original plan was to go south from the kitchen, then take a trip south again, retrieve the bell pepper, etc.

Wait, the user's current location is the bathroom. The previous action was "go north" which led them here. The bathroom's description mentions a sink with a toothbrush and a toilet. The hint here is to go south from the bathroom, as the bathroom's description says "You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked." So the next logical step is to go south from the bathroom to return to the kitchen. Then, from the kitchen, they need to go south again to reach the garden where the bell pepper is. But the user's current position is the bathroom, so the immediate next action should be to go south. That makes sense because the bathroom's south exit is unblocked. So the correct command here is "go south".

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this TextWorld game and has been moving between rooms. Their goal seems to be retrieving the bell pepper from the garden and then doing some actions involving the stove. So far, they've gone through the bedroom, unlocked the door, moved to the kitchen, bathroom, and back. The current location is the bathroom again.

The user's last action was "go north" which took them back to the kitchen. Now, they're at the bathroom again, and the prompt says to think about whether they're on the right track and then give the next action. The original goal mentioned going to the garden to get the bell pepper, then heading north, traveling west, and putting it on the stove. 

But right now, they're in the bathroom. The next logical step would be to go south back to the kitchen, then maybe east to the screen door leading to the garden. But the user has been oscillating between kitchen and bathroom, so maybe they need to find a different path. Wait, in the kitchen, there's a screen door east and a west door back to the bedroom. But the user hasn't gone east yet from the kitchen. Maybe they need to go east from the kitchen to reach the garden where the bell pepper is. But the user hasn't done that yet. 

Looking at the previous steps, after opening the screen door, they tried going east but got stuck. Wait, in the kitchen, the screen door is closed. So maybe they need to open it first. But in the current state, the user is in the bathroom. So the next step should be to go south back to the kitchen, open the screen door, then go east to the garden. Then retrieve the bell pepper. 

But the user's last action was "go north" again, which brought them back to the kitchen. So maybe the next step is to go south again to the bathroom? Wait, no, the user is in the bathroom now. The prompt says to go south from the bathroom, which is unblocked. So perhaps the user is stuck in a loop between kitchen and bathroom. They need to find the correct path to the garden. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west from the kitchen back to the bedroom, then check if there's another way. But the original plan was to go east from the bedroom after unlocking the door. But the user had an issue where after opening the door, they tried going east but got a message saying they need to open the wooden door first. Wait, no, in the bedroom, after unlocking the door, they opened it and went east to the kitchen. Then they went back through the kitchen to the bathroom. So maybe the user needs to go back to the kitchen, open the screen door, then go east to the garden. 

But in the current state, they are in the bathroom. So the next action should be to go south back to the kitchen. Then, from the kitchen, open the screen door east, then go east to the garden. Then retrieve the bell pepper. So the next command should be "go south" from the bathroom to get back to the kitchen. Then proceed to open the screen door and move east. 

But the user is at the bathroom, so the next step is to go south. The user's last action was "go north" which brought them to the kitchen, then the next step would be to go south again to the bathroom. Wait, no, the user is in the bathroom now, so the next action is to go south to the kitchen. But the user has been moving between these rooms, so maybe they need to find the correct path. 

The user's goal is to get the bell pepper from the garden. So they need to reach the garden. The garden is probably east of the kitchen, through the screen door. So the correct path is: from the kitchen, open the screen door, then go east to the garden. Then retrieve the bell pepper. Then go north, west, and put it on the stove. 

So the next action from the bathroom is to go south back to the kitchen. Then open the screen door, go east to the garden. Then take the bell pepper. So the next command is "go south".

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Kitchen and Bathroom, going back and forth. The original goal was to retrieve the bell pepper from the garden and then do some actions. But so far, the user has only managed to open the chest drawer, get the key, unlock the door, and go east to the kitchen. Then they kept going north to the bathroom and back. 

The problem is that the user hasn't moved to the garden yet. The next steps mentioned in the initial instructions were to go east from the bedroom, open the screen door, go east again, then go south to the garden to get the bell pepper. But the user kept going north instead of east after the kitchen.

So the mistake is that after the kitchen, the user should have tried going east again through the screen door, not north. The bathroom is a dead end here. The user needs to go back to the kitchen, open the screen door east, then go east to the garden. Then retrieve the bell pepper, head north, travel west, and put it on the stove.

The user's current position is in the bathroom, so they need to go south back to the kitchen, then east through the screen door. Then proceed to the garden. Once there, take the bell pepper, go north to the kitchen again, west to the bedroom, and put the pepper on the stove.

So the next correct action is to go south from the bathroom back to the kitchen, then east through the screen door to reach the garden. The user has been going north instead of east, which is why they're stuck. They need to correct that direction.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Kitchen and Bathroom. They keep going back and forth, which isn't helpful. The original goal was to retrieve the bell pepper from the garden and then rest it on the stove. But so far, the user has only been moving between rooms without making progress towards that goal.

The user's score is stuck at 5, and they've been moving between rooms without any new actions. The key steps they needed to do were: open the chest drawer, get the old key, unlock the door, go east, open the screen door, go east again, go south, retrieve the bell pepper, then north, west, and put it on the stove. But they haven't reached the garden yet.

The current location is the Kitchen, and the next step should be to find the bell pepper. But the user hasn't gone south from the Kitchen to the garden. Wait, in the Kitchen description, there's an exit to the south. So maybe the user needs to go south from the Kitchen to reach the garden where the bell pepper is. But the user has been going north and south between Kitchen and Bathroom, not moving towards the garden.

So the correct next action should be to go south from the Kitchen to reach the garden. The user needs to focus on getting to the garden, retrieving the bell pepper, and then returning to the stove. The current loop is preventing progress, so the assistant should guide them to go south from the Kitchen.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Kitchen and Bathroom, going back and forth. The original goal was to retrieve the bell pepper from the garden and then do some actions. But so far, the user has only managed to open the chest drawer, get the key, unlock the door, and move east to the kitchen. Then they keep going north to the bathroom and south back to the kitchen, which isn't helping.

The user's score is still at 5, which is low. The original plan was to go east from the bedroom, open the screen door, go east again, then south to the garden to get the bell pepper. But the user is not going towards the garden. Instead, they're moving between kitchen and bathroom, which doesn't align with the original steps.

The user might not be following the correct path. The next step after unlocking the door and going east should be opening the screen door, then going east again to reach the garden. But the user is instead going north to the bathroom. So the mistake is in the direction after the screen door. The user needs to open the screen door, then go east to the garden, not north.

The user needs to be guided to open the screen door and then proceed east to the garden where the bell pepper is. Since the user is stuck in a loop, the assistant should remind them to open the screen door and go east, not north. But the user is repeatedly going north, which is incorrect. So the correct next action is to open the screen door, then go east to the garden.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in the TextWorld game. They started in the bedroom, opened the chest drawer, retrieved the old key, unlocked the door, and went east. Then they moved between the kitchen, bathroom, and back to the kitchen multiple times. Now they're in the kitchen again, and the next step according to the original instructions was to go east to the garden, retrieve the bell pepper, then go north, west, and put it on the stove.

But in the current scenario, the user is in the kitchen, and the available exits are north, south, west (open wooden door), and east (closed screen door). The user tried going east before but was redirected to the bathroom. Now, after several cycles, they're back in the kitchen. The next logical step would be to open the screen door east to proceed to the garden where the bell pepper is located. The user needs to open that door first. So the correct action here is to open the screen door.

Okay, let's see. The user's goal was to retrieve the bell pepper from the garden and then do some actions. So far, they've navigated through the bedroom, kitchen, bathroom, and backyard. In the backyard, they found a patio table and chairs but no bell pepper. The next step mentioned was to "retrieve the bell pepper from the floor of the garden." Since they're in the backyard, maybe the garden is nearby. But the current location is the backyard, which has a patio table and chairs. The user needs to check the garden area. However, the backyard description doesn't mention a garden. Wait, maybe the garden is part of the backyard? Or perhaps there's a different room they need to explore. Alternatively, maybe the bell pepper is on the floor in the backyard. The user should check the backyard's floor. The previous steps included going east from the kitchen to the backyard. Now, in the backyard, they need to look for the bell pepper. The instruction says to "retrieve the bell pepper from the floor of the garden." So perhaps the garden is part of the backyard. The user should look around the backyard for the bell pepper. If it's not there, maybe they need to check another room. But according to the current location, the backyard is the place. So the next action should be to look for the bell pepper in the backyard. But the user needs to "take a trip south" after retrieving the bell pepper. Wait, the original plan was: after opening the screen door, go east, then take a trip south, then retrieve the bell pepper from the garden, then head north, then travel west, then rest the bell pepper on the stove. But the user is now in the backyard. Maybe the garden is in the backyard. So the next step is to check the backyard for the bell pepper. The user should look around. But the current description of the backyard doesn't mention a bell pepper. However, the user's task is to retrieve it, so maybe it's there. The next action would be to check the floor of the backyard for the bell pepper. So the command would be "look around" or "check floor," but in the game's context, the allowed commands are specific. Since the user is in the backyard, they need to find the bell pepper. The previous steps didn't mention a garden, but the original goal says "garden." Maybe the garden is a separate room. But the user is in the backyard. Alternatively, maybe the garden is part of the backyard. The user needs to check the backyard's floor. The next action should be to look for the bell pepper. However, the game might require specific commands. Since the user is in the backyard, they can look around. But the allowed commands are like "look" or "check." However, the user's previous actions were "go east," "open screen door," etc. So the next step is to check the backyard for the bell pepper. The user should "look around" or "check floor." But the game might not accept "look around." Alternatively, the user might need to "check the floor." But the correct command here would be to look for the bell pepper. Since the user is in the backyard, the next action is to check the floor for the bell pepper. So the command would be "look floor" or "check floor." But in the game's context, the correct command might be "look around" or "inspect floor." However, based on the previous interactions, the user has been using "go" commands. So perhaps the next step is to "look around" to find the bell pepper. But the user needs to retrieve it. So the next action is to look for the bell pepper in the backyard.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the original plan, which was to retrieve the bell pepper from the floor of the garden. But in the current Backyard scene, they can't see a bell pepper. The previous attempt was "retrieve bell pepper from floor," which the system rejected. Then the user tried "pick up bell pepper from floor," which also didn't work. The system says the user can't see any such thing.

So, the problem is that the bell pepper isn't visible in the Backyard. The user needs to find where the bell pepper is. The original plan mentioned the garden, but maybe the garden is a different location. Wait, the user had previously gone through the kitchen, bathroom, bedroom, and now the backyard. The garden might be a separate area. But in the current Backyard description, there's no mention of a garden. The Backyard has chairs, a BBQ, a patio table, but no garden. So maybe the garden is another room that's not yet explored.

Alternatively, maybe the bell pepper is in the kitchen island's note. The user saw a note on the kitchen island. The original plan said to retrieve the bell pepper from the floor of the garden. But if the garden isn't accessible yet, perhaps the note in the kitchen has the bell pepper. But the user hasn't checked the note yet. However, the user's current location is the Backyard, so they need to find the bell pepper there. Since it's not there, maybe they need to go back to the kitchen, check the note, and then proceed to the garden.

But the user's next action should be based on the current location. Since the Backyard doesn't have the bell pepper, the user might need to go back to the kitchen, check the note, and then find the garden. However, the user's previous actions have been moving between rooms, and the garden might be a separate area. Alternatively, maybe the garden is the Backyard, but the bell pepper is on the floor, but the user can't see it. Maybe the user needs to look more carefully or check other objects.

Wait, the user's last action was in the Backyard. The Backyard has a patio table, chairs, BBQ, but no mention of a bell pepper. The original plan said to retrieve the bell pepper from the garden's floor. So perhaps the garden is a different room. The user might need to go back to the kitchen, check the note, and then find the garden. But the user is currently in the Backyard. So maybe the next step is to go south, which is unblocked, to reach the garden. But the Backyard's description says there's an unblocked exit to the south. So maybe the garden is south of the Backyard. The user should go south to the garden, then look for the bell pepper there.

But the user's previous attempt to retrieve the bell pepper from the floor failed. So the correct action would be to go south to the garden, then check the floor there. So the next command should be "go south" to reach the garden, then "retrieve bell pepper from floor" or "pick up bell pepper from floor" if possible. But since the user is in the Backyard, the next step is to go south to the garden.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to retrieve the bell pepper from the floor in the Garden. Earlier, when they were in the Backyard, they tried "retrieve bell pepper from floor" but it wasn't recognized. Then they tried "pick up bell pepper from floor" which also didn't work. Now, they're in the Garden, and the description mentions a bell pepper on the floor.

Wait, the user just tried "take bell pepper from floor" again, but the system says "You can't see any such thing." Hmm. Maybe the correct command is just "take bell pepper" without specifying the floor? Or perhaps the bell pepper is already in the inventory? Let me check the previous steps.

In the Garden, the items on the floor are a half bag of chips, an apple, a bell pepper, and a shovel. So the bell pepper is there. The user needs to pick it up. The correct verb is "take" followed by the item. So maybe the command should be "take bell pepper". The previous attempts included "retrieve" and "pick up", which might not be the right verbs here. The game might expect "take" as the verb for picking up items. Let me try that.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in the TextWorld game. They started in the bedroom, opened the chest drawer, got the old key, unlocked the door, and went east. Then they kept moving between kitchen, bathroom, and backyard. Now they're in the backyard again, and the goal was to retrieve the bell pepper from the garden and then rest it on the stove.

Wait, the user just picked up the bell pepper in the garden and went back to the backyard. The next step was to go north to the garden, but they ended up back in the backyard. The current location is the backyard, and the garden is to the north. The user needs to rest the bell pepper on the stove. But where is the stove? Earlier, in the kitchen, there was a stove. So maybe they need to go back to the kitchen.

But the user is in the backyard now. The possible exits are west (screen door) and south. But the garden is north. Wait, when they went north from the backyard, they went to the garden, but then came back. Maybe the stove is in the kitchen, so they need to go back through the kitchen. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go from the garden back to the kitchen. But the current location is the backyard. The garden is north, so going north from backyard leads to garden. Then from garden, maybe go south to backyard again, but that's not helpful. Wait, the user has the bell pepper. They need to rest it on the stove. The stove is in the kitchen. So they need to get back to the kitchen.

But how? The user is in the backyard. The exits are west (screen door) and south. If they go west, they go back to the kitchen. Wait, the screen door in the kitchen leads east to the backyard. So if they go west from the backyard, they go back to the kitchen. Then from the kitchen, they can go north to the bathroom, but that's not helpful. Wait, the user needs to get to the stove in the kitchen. So from the backyard, go west to the kitchen, then go north to the bathroom? No, that's not right. Wait, the kitchen's exits are north (bathroom), south (backyard), west (screen door?), no. Wait, in the kitchen, the exits are north (bathroom), south (backyard), and east (screen door). So from the kitchen, going west might not be an exit. Wait, the kitchen has an open wooden door leading west. So from the kitchen, going west leads back to the bedroom? Or maybe the kitchen is connected to the backyard via the screen door east. So if the user is in the backyard, going west leads to the kitchen. Then from the kitchen, they can go north to the bathroom, but the stove is in the kitchen. So once in the kitchen, they can rest the bell pepper on the stove.

So the next step is to go west from the backyard to the kitchen, then rest the bell pepper on the stove. But the user is currently in the backyard. The current command should be to go west to the kitchen. Then, in the kitchen, rest the bell pepper on the stove. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action is to go west from the backyard to the kitchen.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in this TextWorld game. Their goal seems to be to retrieve the bell pepper and then rest it on the stove. So far, they've managed to get the old key, unlock the door, move through the kitchen and bathroom, and finally reach the garden where they picked up the bell pepper.

Now, the next step according to the original instructions was to head north from the garden, then travel west. But in the current state, the user is in the bathroom again after moving around. Wait, the last action was going north from the kitchen, which led them back to the bathroom. The user is now at the bathroom, and the prompt says to rest the bell pepper on the stove. But the stove is in the kitchen, right?

Wait, the user has the bell pepper. They were in the garden, picked it up, then went back through the kitchen and bathroom. Now they're in the bathroom. The stove is in the kitchen. So the next logical step is to go back to the kitchen, then go to the stove. But the user is in the bathroom. So they need to go south to the kitchen, then maybe go to the stove. But the original plan was to go north from the garden, then west. Maybe there's a confusion in the path.

But the user's current location is the bathroom. The previous steps might have them looping between kitchen and bathroom. The key is to get the bell pepper to the stove. Since they have the bell pepper, they need to go to the kitchen, find the stove, and put it there. So the next action should be to go south from the bathroom to the kitchen, then go to the stove.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a loop between the Kitchen and Bathroom, going back and forth. The original goal was to retrieve the bell pepper, rest it on the stove, and probably move on. But the user has been stuck in a cycle, moving between rooms without making progress towards the goal.

First, the user picked up the bell pepper in the Garden and went north to the Backyard. Then they tried to go west to the Kitchen, but the score hasn't increased much. The main issue is that the user is not moving towards the stove where the bell pepper needs to be placed. 

The current location is the Kitchen, and the user needs to go east to the Screen Door, then maybe to the Garden again to place the bell pepper on the stove. But the user hasn't tried that yet. The score is at 9/27, so there's still room to improve. 

The next logical step is to go east from the Kitchen to the Screen Door, then proceed to the Garden to place the bell pepper on the stove. That would be the correct sequence to complete the task. The user needs to focus on moving towards the stove and not get stuck in the same rooms.

-= Kitchen =-
You've just sauntered into a kitchen.

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a refrigerator. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a counter. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. You make out a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. The stove is ordinary. The stove appears to be empty. You can see a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game where they have to navigate through different rooms and complete specific tasks. The goal seems to involve collecting items and moving through various rooms.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Kitchen again. The previous actions included opening doors, retrieving items like the old key and bell pepper, and moving between rooms. The current task mentioned in the initial instructions was to rest the bell pepper on the stove. The user has the bell pepper, so the next logical step would be to go to the stove and place it there.

But wait, the user is in the Kitchen. The stove is mentioned as being in the Kitchen. So the action should be to go to the stove. However, the game's response after picking up the bell pepper was moving back to the Backyard, then to the Kitchen again. The user needs to go to the stove location. The stove is in the Kitchen, so the command should be to go to the stove. But in the game's context, the player might need to use a specific command like 'go to stove' or 'go to the stove'. However, based on previous interactions, the user has been using commands like 'go north', 'open door', etc. So maybe the correct command here is 'go to stove' or 'go to the stove'.

But looking at the previous commands, when the user was in the Garden, they had to 'take bell pepper from floor', which worked after some attempts. Now, in the Kitchen, the stove is present. So the next step is to go to the stove. The user has the bell pepper, so they need to place it on the stove. The correct command would be 'go to stove' to reach it, then 'put bell pepper on stove'.

But the user's last action was 'go south' leading back to the Kitchen. The current room is the Kitchen, and the stove is here. So the next command should be 'go to stove' or 'go to the stove'. However, the game might require the exact phrasing. Since the user has been using 'go north' and 'go east', maybe 'go to stove' is the correct command here. Alternatively, if the stove is in the room, maybe the user can just 'put bell pepper on stove' once they are near it. But the user needs to be in the same room as the stove. Since they are already in the Kitchen, which has the stove, the next step is to put the bell pepper on the stove.
