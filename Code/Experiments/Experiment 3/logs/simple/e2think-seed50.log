Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to open the chest drawer in the bedroom. After that, pick up the old key from the chest drawer within the bedroom. And then, look and see that the wooden door in the bedroom is unlocked. Then, open the wooden door inside the bedroom. After that, make an effort to move east. And then, go to the south. And then, recover the half of a bag of chips from the couch. Once you have got the half of a bag of chips, go north. With that over with, put the half of a bag of chips on the stove. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Bedroom =-
Well, here we are in the bedroom. Let's see what's in here.

You can see a closed chest drawer. You make out an antique trunk. You see a king-size bed. You shudder, but continue examining the king-size bed. The king-size bed is ordinary. The king-size bed appears to be empty.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me see. The user has already opened the chest drawer and picked up the old key. The next step according to the instructions was to check if the wooden door in the bedroom is unlocked. But wait, the user mentioned that after picking up the key, they need to look and see that the door is unlocked. But in the current scene, the door is closed. Hmm, maybe the key is needed to unlock it.

Wait, the user's previous action was picking up the key. Now, the next step is to check if the door is unlocked. But the door is closed. Maybe the key is required to open it. So the next action should be to try opening the door with the key. But the game might have specific commands. Let me check the previous steps again.

The original instructions said: after picking up the key, look and see that the wooden door is unlocked. But in the current state, the door is closed. So maybe the key is needed to unlock it. So the next step is to try opening the door. But the user has to use the key. So the correct action here is to try opening the door. But the game might have a command like "use key on door" or "open door". However, the user's previous actions were "open chest drawer" and "pick up old key". Now, the next step is to open the wooden door. But the door is closed. So the user needs to open it. But how? Maybe using the key. So the next action should be "open wooden door" or "use key on door". But the game might require the key to unlock it. So the correct command here is "open wooden door". Let me check the previous messages. The user was told to "look and see that the wooden door in the bedroom is unlocked". But the door is closed. So maybe the key is needed to unlock it. Therefore, the next action is to open the door with the key. But the game might require the user to use the key on the door. However, the user's previous actions were "open chest drawer" and "pick up old key". Now, the next step is to open the door. So the correct command is "open wooden door". But since the door is closed, maybe the key is needed. So the user should try to open the door. The game might accept "open wooden door" as the command. So the next action is "open wooden door".

Okay, the user tried to use the key on the door but got an error because "use key on wooden door" isn't a valid command. The correct action should be to open the door with the key. Maybe the command is just "open door" or "unlock door". Since the key is in hand, the next step is to try opening the door. The previous valid commands were "open chest drawer" and "pick up old key". Now, the door is closed but the key is available. The correct command here is likely "open door" or "unlock door". Let me check the game's possible commands. The user is in the bedroom, and the door is closed. The key is needed to open it. So the next action should be "open door" or "unlock door". Since the game might expect "open door", I'll try that.

Okay, let's see. The user has successfully unlocked the wooden door. The next step according to the original instructions was to move east after opening the door. So now that the door is unlocked, the next action should be to go east. The user needs to type "go east" to move into the next room. Let me make sure that's the correct next step. The original plan was: open chest drawer, pick up key, unlock door, then move east, then go south, etc. So yes, after unlocking the door, moving east is the next step. The command should be "go east".

Okay, let me recap the steps so far. The user started by opening the chest drawer, picking up the key, then tried to unlock the door. The game mentioned that they needed to open the door first, but they already unlocked it. Now, after opening the door, the next step according to the original instructions was to move east. So the correct action here is to go east. The user has already unlocked the door, so moving east should be the next command. Let me make sure there's no confusion here. The door is open, so "go east" is the right move. The score increased, so progress is being made. The next room should be accessible now.

-= Kitchen =-
You've just sauntered into a kitchen. You begin looking for stuff.

Oh, great. Here's a refrigerator. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a counter. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a counter? The counter is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You can make out a stove. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a stove, go to TextWorld. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove. Were you looking for a kitchen island? Because look over there, it's a kitchen island. The kitchen island is typical. On the kitchen island you see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps correctly. They opened the chest drawer, got the key, unlocked the door, moved east to the kitchen, then south to the living room. Now, in the living room, they need to pick up the half of a bag of chips from the couch. The next step according to the original instructions was to recover the half of a bag of chips from the couch. So the correct command here is "pick up half of a bag of chips" or simply "take half of a bag of chips". But the game might expect a specific phrasing. Looking at the previous commands, the user used "pick up old key", so maybe "pick up half of a bag of chips" is the right way. Alternatively, since the item is on the couch, maybe "take half of a bag of chips from couch". But the game's response mentioned the half of a bag of chips is on the couch, so the command should be to pick it up. The next action after that is to go north, as per the original plan. But first, pick up the chips. So the next command is "pick up half of a bag of chips".
