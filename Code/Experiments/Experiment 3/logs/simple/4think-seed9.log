Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First, it would be good if you could open the chest drawer within the bedroom. And then, take the old key from the chest drawer within the bedroom. With the old key, unlock the wooden door. Then, ensure that the wooden door within the bedroom is open. After that, make an effort to head east. If you can accomplish that, open the refrigerator inside the kitchen. After that, recover the lettuce from the refrigerator in the kitchen. After that, rest the lettuce on the stove. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Bedroom =-
You're now in the bedroom. Let's see what's in here.

You can make out a closed chest drawer. You see an antique trunk. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You make out a king-size bed. The king-size bed is normal. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text adventure game called TextWorld. The goal is to follow a series of steps to win. So far, they've been in the bedroom, opened the chest drawer, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door, and tried to go east. But the game said they need to open the wooden door first.

Wait, the user just tried to go east, but the game responded that they have to open the wooden door first. So the door is locked, and they need to unlock it. But they already unlocked it with the old key. Hmm, maybe there's a misunderstanding. Let me check the previous steps again.

The user started in the bedroom, opened the chest drawer, took the old key, then unlocked the wooden door. Then they tried to go east. The game said they need to open the door first. But they already unlocked it. Maybe the door is still closed? Or maybe the action to open the door is required before moving east. Wait, the initial description said there's a closed wooden door leading east. The user unlocked it, but maybe they need to open it instead of just unlocking? Or maybe the door is locked and needs to be opened, and unlocking is a separate action.

Wait, the user's last action was "unlock wooden door with old key", which the game accepted. Then they tried to go east, but the game said they have to open the door first. That suggests that even though they unlocked it, the door is still closed and needs to be opened. Maybe the game considers unlocking as different from opening. Or perhaps the door is locked and requires opening, and unlocking is part of that process. Maybe the correct action is to open the door instead of unlocking it. But the user already used the key to unlock it. Maybe the game is expecting them to open the door after unlocking. But the game's message says they need to open the door first. So perhaps the user needs to open the door again, even though they already unlocked it. Alternatively, maybe the door is not fully open yet, and they need to open it.

So the next step would be to open the wooden door. But the user already unlocked it. Wait, maybe the game's message is a bit confusing. Let me think again. The user tried to go east, but the game said they need to open the door first. So even though they unlocked it, the door is still closed, and they need to open it. So the correct action would be to open the door. But how? Maybe the action is "open wooden door". Alternatively, maybe the door is locked and needs to be opened, and unlocking is part of that. But the user already unlocked it. Maybe the game is expecting them to open the door after unlocking. So the next action should be to open the door. Let me check the previous steps again.

Original task: unlock the wooden door. Then ensure it's open. So after unlocking, they need to open it. But the game's message says they have to open it first. So maybe the user needs to open the door again. So the next action is to open the wooden door. But the user already unlocked it. Maybe the game is using different terms. So the user should try to open the door again. So the next command is "open wooden door".

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. An usual one.

A closed refrigerator is here. You scan the room for a counter, and you find a counter. The counter is ordinary. But the thing is empty. You move on, clearly infuriated by your TextWorld experience. You see a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You see a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island, so there's that.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Okay, let me think through this. The user has been following the steps to complete the game. So far, they've opened the chest drawer, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door, opened it, and entered the kitchen. They opened the refrigerator and found a lettuce and some chips.

The next step according to the original task was to take the lettuce from the refrigerator. The user has just done that, so the next action should be to rest the lettuce on the stove. But wait, in the current kitchen description, the stove is mentioned as being empty. So the user needs to place the lettuce there. 

But the user's last action was opening the refrigerator, and the response showed the contents. Now, the next logical step is to take the lettuce. Then, after taking it, they need to go to the stove and put it there. However, the user's next input should be the command to take the lettuce. But the assistant's previous response was "open refrigerator", which the user did. Now, the user's next action should be to take the lettuce. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the correct next command is "take lettuce from refrigerator". But the user might have already done that. Wait, the user's last action was "open refrigerator", and the game response showed the lettuce is there. So the next step is to take the lettuce. Then, go to the stove and put it there. So the next command should be "take lettuce from refrigerator". But the user hasn't done that yet. So the assistant should tell them to take the lettuce. But the user's last input was "open refrigerator", and the game response is showing the lettuce is there. So the next action is to take the lettuce. Therefore, the correct command is "take lettuce from refrigerator".
