It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First step, doublecheck that the antique trunk in the bedroom is wide open. After that, pick up the old key from the antique trunk. After that, make it so that the wooden door inside the bedroom is unlocked with the old key. And then, ensure that the wooden door is open. Then, move east. Then, try to head south. Then, pick up the milk from the couch. Then, make an effort to travel north. Then, put the milk on the stove. That's it!

-= Bedroom =-
I never took you for the sort of person who would show up in a bedroom, but I guess I was wrong.

You can make out a closed chest drawer. You can make out a closed antique trunk. Hey, want to see a king-size bed? Look over there, a king-size bed. The king-size bed is usual. The king-size bed appears to be empty. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they need to follow a series of steps. So far, they've checked the antique trunk in the bedroom, opened it, and found an old key. The next steps according to the original task are to unlock the wooden door in the bedroom with the key, then open it, move east, head south, pick up milk from the couch, travel north, put the milk on the stove.

Now, the current location is the bedroom. The next logical step after getting the key is to use it to unlock the wooden door. The user has to make sure the door is unlocked and then open it. So the next action should be to unlock the door with the old key. The command would be "unlock wooden door with old key". But in the game's context, maybe the exact phrasing is different. Let me check the previous actions. The user was told to "make it so that the wooden door inside the bedroom is unlocked with the old key". So the correct command here is to unlock the door using the key. After that, they need to open the door. So the next step is to unlock the door with the key. Then open it. Then move east, etc.

But the user's last action was opening the trunk and getting the key. The next step is to unlock the door. So the next command should be "unlock wooden door with old key". Then, after that, open the door. But the user has to input each command one at a time. So the next action is to unlock the door with the key. Let me make sure that's the correct next step. Yes, that's the next step in the task. So the answer is "unlock wooden door with old key".

Okay, let's see. The user has the old key now. The next step is to unlock the wooden door in the bedroom. So the command should be "unlock wooden door with old key". But wait, the previous attempt to unlock the door without taking the key failed. Now that the key is taken, the correct action is to use it to unlock the door. So the next command is definitely "unlock wooden door with old key".

Okay, let's see. The user has successfully opened the wooden door leading east. The next step according to the original task is to move east. So the next command should be "go east". Then, after moving east, they need to try to head south. So after moving east, the next action would be "go south". But the user has to do each step one at a time. The current location is outside the bedroom, now that the door is open. So the next step is to move east. Let me check the previous steps again. The user opened the door, so now they can go through it. The next command is "go east".

You arrive in a kitchen.

You see a refrigerator. You make out a counter. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You can see a stove. The stove is ordinary. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. This always happens! Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an unguarded exit to the north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a couch. On the couch you can make out a milk. You make out a low table. On the low table you make out a remote. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You see a tv. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Okay, the user tried to type "go north" but got an error. Let me check the possible commands. In TextWorld, the correct verb for moving is "go" followed by the direction. So instead of "go north", it should be "north". The game might not recognize "go" as a prefix here. So the correct command is just "north". Let me confirm that. Yes, in many text adventures, you just enter the direction without "go". So the next action should be "north".

Okay, the user tried to "put milk on stove" but got an error. Let me think. The correct command should be "put milk on stove" but maybe the game expects a different phrasing. Wait, in TextWorld, sometimes you need to specify the object first. Maybe "put stove milk" or "place milk on stove". But the user had "put milk on stove", which is correct. Wait, maybe the stove is not the right object. The user is in the Living Room, and the stove is in the Kitchen. So the milk is on the couch, then the user went to the Kitchen, but maybe the stove is in the Kitchen. Wait, the user is in the Living Room now. Wait, the previous steps: the user took the milk from the couch in the Living Room, then went north to the Kitchen, then south back to Living Room. So the milk is in the user's inventory. To put it on the stove, the user needs to be in the Kitchen where the stove is. But the user is in the Living Room. So the correct action is to go back to the Kitchen, then put the milk on the stove. But the user is trying to put it here. So maybe the command is incorrect because the stove is not here. So the correct action is to go to the Kitchen first. But the user is in the Living Room. So the next step is to go north to the Kitchen again, then put the milk on the stove. But the user is trying to put it here. So the error is because the stove is not in the Living Room. Therefore, the correct next action is to go north to the Kitchen, then put the milk on the stove. But the user is in the Living Room, so they need to go north again. So the next command should be "go north" to reach the Kitchen, then "put milk on stove". But the user is trying to put it here, which is incorrect. So the answer is to go north again.
