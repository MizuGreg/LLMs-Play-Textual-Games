Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, doublecheck that the antique trunk in the bedroom is open. Then, pick up the old key from the antique trunk. Then, make it so that the wooden door within the bedroom is unlocked. Then, open the wooden door. After opening the wooden door, venture east. Then, open the screen door. Then, make an attempt to head east. That done, take a trip south. Then, pick up the milk from the floor of the garden. After getting the milk, try to head north. That done, attempt to take a trip west. Then, sit the milk on the stove in the kitchen. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Bedroom =-
You find yourself in a bedroom. An usual one. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You can see a chest drawer. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's an antique trunk. Were you looking for a king-size bed? Because look over there, it's a king-size bed. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Garden room. The goal was to pick up the milk from the floor of the garden. The user just arrived here, and the milk is on the floor. The next step is to pick up the milk.

Looking at the available objects in the Garden: there's a lettuce, a milk, a half of a bag of chips, and a shovel. The user needs to take the milk. The correct command would be "take milk from floor" or just "take milk" if the milk is on the floor. But according to the previous interactions, when the user was in the Kitchen, they took the milk from the floor. Wait, in the Kitchen, the user was told to pick up the milk from the floor of the garden after venturing east. Wait, no, the steps were: after opening the screen door and going east to the backyard, then going south to the garden. Now in the garden, the milk is on the floor. So the next action is to take the milk. The command should be "take milk" or "take milk from floor". But in the previous step, when the user was in the Garden, the milk is on the floor, so the correct command is "take milk".

But the user's last action was "go south", leading to the Garden. Now, the next step is to pick up the milk. So the command should be "take milk".

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Garden and Backyard. They've picked up the milk and are trying to move north and south again. The goal was to take the milk to the stove in the kitchen. But after picking up the milk in the garden, the next step is to go north back to the backyard, then maybe west through the screen door to the kitchen. Wait, earlier steps had the user go east to the backyard, then south to the garden. Now, after picking up the milk, they need to go back north to the backyard, then west through the screen door to reach the kitchen. But the user is repeatedly going south and north, which isn't helpful. The correct path after the garden is to go north to the backyard, then west through the screen door to the kitchen. Once in the kitchen, they can put the milk on the stove. So the next action should be to go north from the garden to the backyard, then west through the screen door to the kitchen. But the user is stuck in a loop, so the next command should be "go north" to get back to the backyard, then "go west" through the screen door to the kitchen. However, the user's last action was "go south" again, so the next step is to "go north" to exit the garden and proceed to the backyard. Then, from the backyard, go west through the screen door to the kitchen. Once in the kitchen, put the milk on the stove. So the next command should be "go north" to move from the garden back to the backyard.
