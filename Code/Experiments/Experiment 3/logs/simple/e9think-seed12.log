I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First off, ensure that the antique trunk within the bedroom is open. After that, recover the old key from the antique trunk. After that, make it so that the wooden door in the bedroom is unlocked with the old key. And then, make absolutely sure that the wooden door inside the bedroom is ajar. After opening the wooden door, go east. Then, doublecheck that the screen door is wide open. And then, attempt to travel east. And then, try to travel south. With that done, lift the milk from the floor of the garden. After stealing the milk, head north. And then, attempt to travel west. With that done, rest the milk on the stove. That's it!

-= Bedroom =-
I am sorry to announce that you are now in the bedroom. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a chest drawer. You scan the room for an antique trunk, and you find an antique trunk. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to a king-size bed. The king-size bed is standard. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. You think about smashing the king-size bed to bits, throwing the bits in the dump, etc, until you get bored.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

You can see a closed refrigerator in the room. You can make out a counter. The counter is usual. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. You scan the room, seeing a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. You can see a kitchen island. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? On the kitchen island you can see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game and has followed a series of steps to open doors and move through rooms. The current location is the Kitchen after moving east from the Bedroom. The task was to double-check that the screen door is wide open, which they did by opening it. Now, the next step according to the original instructions was to attempt to travel east again after ensuring the screen door is open.

Looking at the current room description, there's a closed refrigerator, a counter, a stove, a kitchen island with a note, a closed screen door leading east, an open wooden door west, and exits north and south. The user just opened the screen door, so the next logical step would be to go east through the screen door. However, the user might need to check if there are any other steps required before moving. But according to the original plan, after double-checking the screen door is open, they should attempt to travel east. So the next action should be "go east".

Okay, the user is trying to pick up the milk from the floor in the Garden room. They've tried "pick up milk from floor" multiple times, but the system keeps responding that it only understood up to wanting to pick up the milk. Maybe the correct command is just "pick up milk" without specifying "from floor" since the game might automatically recognize the location.

Looking at the previous interactions, when the user was in the Kitchen, they had to "open screen door" and then "go east" to reach the Backyard. Now, in the Garden, the milk is on the floor. The correct action might be simply "pick up milk" because the game's parser might handle the location context. The user has been instructed to "lift the milk from the floor of the garden," so maybe the exact phrasing is important. However, the system's responses suggest that "pick up milk" is the correct command. The user might need to try that instead of specifying "from floor" each time. Alternatively, maybe "take milk" is the right verb. But the user has been using "pick up" previously. Wait, in the Garden, the milk is on the floor, so perhaps the correct command is "pick up milk" without any additional words. The system's previous response said "I only understood you as far as wanting to pick up the milk," which implies that the command is partially understood. Maybe the correct command is just "pick up milk" without the "from floor" part. Let me check the previous steps. The user was told to "lift the milk from the floor of the garden," so the exact command might be "pick up milk" since the game might already know the location. The user has been trying "pick up milk from floor" but the system isn't accepting it. So the next step is to try "pick up milk" alone.

But there isn't a thing on it. You can see a kitchen island. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? On the kitchen island you can see a note.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Kitchen and Bathroom, going back and forth. The original goal was to lift the milk, rest it on the stove, and then maybe other steps. But the user has already picked up the milk in the Garden. The current step after going south again is back in the Kitchen. The next action should be to go north again to reach the Bathroom, but the user might need to check if there's anything else to do here. However, the original plan was to rest the milk on the stove. Wait, the user is in the Kitchen now. The stove is mentioned in the Kitchen description. So maybe the next step is to go to the stove and put the milk there. But the user has the milk in hand. So the correct command would be to "rest milk on stove" or "put milk on stove". But the game might require the exact phrasing. The user needs to check the available actions. Since the user is in the Kitchen, and the stove is present, the next action should be to rest the milk on the stove. The previous steps had the user pick up the milk, so now they need to place it. The correct command is likely "rest milk on stove" or "put milk on stove". The user should try that.

That's not a verb I recognise.
