You are now playing a exciting game of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First stop, assure that the chest drawer in the bedroom is wide open. And then, pick up the old key from the chest drawer inside the bedroom. Then, check that the wooden door is unlocked with the old key. After unlocking the wooden door, assure that the wooden door is wide open. After that, head east. Then, ensure that the screen door in the kitchen is open. Then, make an attempt to move east. With that accomplished, make an attempt to head south. Then, pick-up the lettuce from the floor of the garden. Then, travel north. Then, try to take a trip west. Then, rest the lettuce on the stove inside the kitchen. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Bedroom =-
You arrive in a bedroom. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You make out a chest drawer. What's that over there? It looks like it's an antique trunk. Were you looking for a king-size bed? Because look over there, it's a king-size bed. The king-size bed is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.

You see a closed refrigerator. What's that over there? It looks like it's a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is ordinary. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. What's the point of an empty counter? You can see a stove. The stove is usual. The stove appears to be empty. You see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is standard. On the kitchen island you make out a note. Hmmm... what else, what else?

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

Okay, let me go through the steps again to make sure I'm on track. The user has already completed the tasks in the bedroom: opened the chest drawer, picked up the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, then went east into the kitchen. The next steps according to the original task were to ensure the screen door in the kitchen is open, then try to move east, then south, pick up the lettuce in the garden, travel north, west, rest the lettuce on the stove, and finally stop.

In the kitchen, the user now sees a closed screen door leading east and an open wooden door west. The next step mentioned was to ensure the screen door is open. So the next action should be to open the screen door. But wait, the user's last action was going east, which led them to the kitchen. Wait, no—the user was in the bedroom, opened the door, went east into the kitchen. Now, in the kitchen, the screen door is closed. The next task is to check the screen door in the kitchen is open. So the correct next step is to open the screen door. But the user's last action was "go east", which led them into the kitchen. Now, in the kitchen, the screen door is closed. So the next action should be to open the screen door. But the user's current location is the kitchen. So the next command should be "open screen door". But the game's response after going east into the kitchen says that the screen door is closed. So the user needs to open it. Then, after that, the next step is to attempt to move east again. But the user's next action should be to open the screen door. However, the user's previous action was "go east", which brought them into the kitchen. Now, in the kitchen, the screen door is closed. So the next step is to open it. Therefore, the next command should be "open screen door".

Okay, the user is trying to move east but the game isn't recognizing "try to move east" as a valid command. Let me check the possible commands in the kitchen. The user is in the kitchen, which has a screen door leading east that they just opened. The previous action was opening the screen door, so maybe the next step is to go through it. The correct command should be "go east" instead of "try to move east". The game might not accept "try to" prefixes. So the next action should be "go east" to move into the next room. Let me confirm the available commands. The user is in the kitchen, and after opening the screen door, they can go east. So the correct command is "go east".

-= Backyard =-
You're now in the backyard. You begin looking for stuff.

You make out a set of chairs. The set of chairs is ordinary. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? Oh, great. Here's a bbq. The bbq appears to be empty. Hm. Oh well Look over there! a patio table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the patio table.

There is an open screen door leading west. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

Okay, let's see. The user has to rest the lettuce on the stove inside the kitchen. They're currently in the kitchen again after going west from the backyard. They picked up the lettuce in the garden and went north back to the backyard, then west to the kitchen. Now, they need to place the lettuce on the stove.

First, check if the stove is accessible. The stove is described as "usual" and "empty". The user has the lettuce in hand. The next step is to go to the stove and put the lettuce there. But the command to put it down would be "put lettuce on stove" or similar. However, the game might require specific verbs. Earlier steps used "pick up" and "open", so maybe "put" is the correct verb here. The user is holding the lettuce, so they need to place it on the stove. The correct command should be "put lettuce on stove".
