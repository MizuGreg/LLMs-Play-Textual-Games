I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, open the antique trunk. And then, retrieve the old key from the antique trunk. With the old key, unlock the wooden door inside the bedroom with the old key. Then, ensure that the wooden door is open. And then, head east. After that, ensure that the screen door is open. And then, head east. And then, try to move south. And then, pick-up the bell pepper from the floor of the garden. With the bell pepper, attempt to head north. With that accomplished, go to the west. And then, place the bell pepper on the stove. Alright, thanks!

-= Bedroom =-
Ah, the bedroom. This is some kind of bedroom, really great normal vibes in this place, a wonderful normal atmosphere. You can barely contain your excitement.

You can make out a closed chest drawer in the room. You can see a closed antique trunk nearby. You make out a king-size bed. The king-size bed is normal. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

You are in a kitchen. It seems to be pretty usual here.

Were you looking for a refrigerator? Because look over there, it's a refrigerator. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. The counter appears to be empty. You scan the room, seeing a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is typical. On the kitchen island you make out a note. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in the game and has been trying to pick up the bell pepper. They've tried "pick up the bell pepper from the floor" and "take the bell pepper from the floor" but both times the game responded that the bell pepper isn't visible. The current location is the Garden, where the description mentions there's a milk, a half of a bag of chips, a bell pepper, and a shovel on the floor. Wait, maybe the user is using the wrong command structure. In TextWorld, the correct command would be "take bell pepper" without specifying "from the floor" since the game might automatically recognize it's on the floor. Alternatively, maybe the game expects "pick up" instead of "take". But the user tried both. The game's response says "You can't see any such thing," which is confusing because the description does mention the bell pepper is on the floor. Maybe there's a typo in the item name? The user might need to use the exact name as in the game's inventory. Let me check the previous messages. The garden's description says "a bell pepper and a shovel on the floor." So the correct command should be "take bell pepper" or "pick up bell pepper". The user tried "pick up the bell pepper from the floor" which might be too verbose. The game might not recognize "the" or "from the floor". So the next action should be to take the bell pepper directly. Let me try that.

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. It seems to be pretty usual here.

Were you looking for a refrigerator? Because look over there, it's a refrigerator. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. The counter appears to be empty. You scan the room, seeing a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is typical. On the kitchen island you make out a note. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

Look over there! a toilet. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You make out a bath. You see a sink. The sink is normal. On the sink you can see a toothbrush.

There is an unguarded exit to the south.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text adventure game and has been moving around different rooms. Their goal was to follow a series of steps: open the antique trunk, get the old key, unlock the wooden door, ensure it's open, go east, open the screen door, go east again, move south, pick up the bell pepper, use it to go north, then west, and place it on the stove.

So far, the user has managed to get the key, unlock the door, open it, go east to the kitchen, then back and forth between kitchen, bathroom, and kitchen again. They picked up the bell pepper in the garden and tried to go north, but ended up looping between the kitchen and bathroom. 

The current score is 9/25, which suggests they've completed some steps but are stuck in a loop. The main issue seems to be that after picking up the bell pepper, they tried to go north but ended up in the bathroom, then back to the kitchen. The user might not have placed the bell pepper on the stove yet, which is part of the original goal.

The next step should be to place the bell pepper on the stove in the kitchen. But the user is currently in the kitchen again, so maybe they need to go back to the garden where they picked it up. Wait, no—the bell pepper was picked up in the garden, then they went north to the backyard, then to the kitchen. Now they're in the kitchen again. To place it on the stove, they need to be in the kitchen. But the stove is in the kitchen. However, the user hasn't placed it yet. 

But the user's last action was going north from the kitchen to the bathroom, then back. So they need to go back to the kitchen, then try to place the bell pepper on the stove. But the problem is that the user might not have the bell pepper with them. Wait, no—they picked it up in the garden, then went to the backyard, then kitchen. So they should still have it. 

So the next step would be to go back to the kitchen, then try to place the bell pepper on the stove. But the user is currently in the kitchen, so maybe they need to use the command "put bell pepper on stove" or something similar. However, in the game's context, the correct command might be "put the bell pepper on the stove" or "place the bell pepper on the stove". 

But the user's previous attempts to go north and south have led them in circles. So the correct next action is to place the bell pepper on the stove in the kitchen. The user is in the kitchen, so they can do that. The next command should be "put bell pepper on stove".
