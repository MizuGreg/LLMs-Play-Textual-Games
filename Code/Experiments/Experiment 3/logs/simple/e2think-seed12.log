I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First off, ensure that the antique trunk within the bedroom is open. After that, recover the old key from the antique trunk. After that, make it so that the wooden door in the bedroom is unlocked with the old key. And then, make absolutely sure that the wooden door inside the bedroom is ajar. After opening the wooden door, go east. Then, doublecheck that the screen door is wide open. And then, attempt to travel east. And then, try to travel south. With that done, lift the milk from the floor of the garden. After stealing the milk, head north. And then, attempt to travel west. With that done, rest the milk on the stove. That's it!

-= Bedroom =-
I am sorry to announce that you are now in the bedroom. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a chest drawer. You scan the room for an antique trunk, and you find an antique trunk. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to a king-size bed. The king-size bed is standard. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. You think about smashing the king-size bed to bits, throwing the bits in the dump, etc, until you get bored.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user has already opened the antique trunk and taken the old key. The next step according to the task was to unlock the wooden door in the bedroom with the old key. So I need to use the key on the door.

Wait, the current room is the bedroom, and there's a closed wooden door leading east. The user has the old key, so the next logical step is to unlock that door. The command would be "unlock wooden door with old key" or something similar. But in TextWorld, the exact phrasing might matter. Maybe "unlock door with old key" since the door is wooden and the key is the old one. Let me check the previous actions. The user was told to "make it so that the wooden door in the bedroom is unlocked with the old key." So the action is to unlock the door using the key. The correct command here would be "unlock wooden door with old key". But I need to make sure that's the right syntax. Alternatively, maybe just "use old key on wooden door". But the user's previous actions were "open antique trunk" and "take old key from antique trunk". So following that pattern, the next step is to unlock the door with the key. So the command should be "unlock wooden door with old key".

Okay, let's see. The user tried to push the wooden door open, but it didn't work. The door was unlocked, but maybe it's still closed. The task was to make sure the door is ajar. So maybe after unlocking, they need to open it manually or find another way. Since the user can't push it open, perhaps they need to use the key again, but the door is already unlocked. Wait, maybe the door is locked but they unlocked it, so now they need to open it. But the command "push wooden door open" didn't work. Maybe the correct action is to "open wooden door" instead. Let me check the previous steps. The user unlocked the door, but it's still closed. So the next step should be to open it. The correct command would be "open wooden door".

But there isn't a thing on it. You can see a kitchen island. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? On the kitchen island you can see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Okay, the user is in the Backyard now. The next step according to the task was to attempt to travel east. But the current room's description says there's an open screen door leading west and an exit to the south. Wait, the user just came from the kitchen, so they went east into the backyard. The task said after opening the screen door, go east, then double-check the screen door is open, then travel east again. Wait, maybe the user needs to check if the screen door is open again. But the screen door was already opened in the kitchen. Alternatively, maybe the next step is to travel east from the backyard. But the backyard's description doesn't mention a door east. Wait, the user came from the kitchen, which had a screen door leading east to the backyard. So in the backyard, the screen door is west. The task said after opening the screen door, go east. But in the backyard, going east might not be possible. Wait, maybe the user is supposed to go south from the backyard. The task said after opening the screen door, attempt to travel east, then try to travel south. So maybe after being in the backyard, the user should try to go east, but there's no door east. Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go south. The task said "after opening the screen door, go east. Then, doublecheck that the screen door is wide open. And then, attempt to travel east. And then, try to travel south." So maybe after opening the screen door in the kitchen, the user went east to the backyard. Then, they need to double-check the screen door is open (which it is), then attempt to travel east again (but from the backyard, maybe there's no east direction). Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go south from the backyard. The backyard has an exit to the south. So the next action would be to go south. But the task says after attempting to travel east, then try to travel south. So perhaps the user is in the backyard, tried to go east (but can't), then goes south. But the user's last action was "go east" which led to the backyard. Now, the next step is to double-check the screen door is open (already done), then attempt to travel east (maybe from the backyard, but there's no east door). Maybe the user is supposed to go south. So the next command would be "go south".

Okay, the user tried to "lift milk from floor" but got an error. The correct command should be "lift milk" or "pick up milk". The game might not accept "from floor" part.

Okay, the user is trying to pick up the milk but the commands "lift milk" and "pickup milk" aren't working. Maybe the correct verb is "take milk" or "get milk". Let me check the previous interactions. The user was told to "lift the milk from the floor of the garden". The game might expect "take" instead of "lift" or "pickup". Alternatively, maybe "pick up milk" is the correct command, but the user might need to specify the object first. Wait, in some games, you have to use "take" followed by the object. So perhaps the correct command is "take milk". Let me try that.

-= Bathroom =-
You arrive in a bathroom. A typical kind of place.

You see a closed ordinary looking toilet in the room. You see a bath. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? Hey, want to see a sink? Look over there, a sink. The sink is ordinary. On the sink you can make out a toothbrush.

There is an unblocked exit to the south.

-= Kitchen =-
Of every kitchen you could have sauntered into, you had to walk into an ordinary one. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You can see a closed refrigerator in the room. You can make out a counter. The counter is usual. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. You scan the room, seeing a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. You can see a kitchen island. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? On the kitchen island you can see a note.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

-= Kitchen =-
Of every kitchen you could have sauntered into, you had to walk into an ordinary one. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You can see a closed refrigerator in the room. You can make out a counter. The counter is usual. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. You scan the room, seeing a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. You can see a kitchen island. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? On the kitchen island you can see a note.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Okay, the user has been stuck in a loop between the Kitchen and Bathroom for a while. They keep going back and forth between the two rooms. The task was to rest the milk on the stove. The user has the milk, but they're not in the kitchen anymore. They need to get back to the kitchen and put the milk on the stove.

Wait, the user just came from the bathroom and is back in the kitchen. The kitchen has a stove, so the next step is to rest the milk on the stove. The command should be "put milk on stove". But the user might have to first go to the stove's location. However, in the kitchen description, the stove is mentioned as being in the room. So the user can directly put the milk on the stove. The correct command is "put milk on stove".
