I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, open the antique trunk. And then, retrieve the old key from the antique trunk. With the old key, unlock the wooden door inside the bedroom with the old key. Then, ensure that the wooden door is open. And then, head east. After that, ensure that the screen door is open. And then, head east. And then, try to move south. And then, pick-up the bell pepper from the floor of the garden. With the bell pepper, attempt to head north. With that accomplished, go to the west. And then, place the bell pepper on the stove. Alright, thanks!

-= Bedroom =-
Ah, the bedroom. This is some kind of bedroom, really great normal vibes in this place, a wonderful normal atmosphere. You can barely contain your excitement.

You can make out a closed chest drawer in the room. You can see a closed antique trunk nearby. You make out a king-size bed. The king-size bed is normal. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

You are in a kitchen. It seems to be pretty usual here.

Were you looking for a refrigerator? Because look over there, it's a refrigerator. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. The counter appears to be empty. You scan the room, seeing a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is typical. On the kitchen island you make out a note. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game called TextWorld, and they've been following a set of instructions to complete tasks. The current situation is in the Garden, where they need to pick up the bell pepper from the floor. The user has tried several times to pick it up, but the game hasn't recognized it. The previous attempts resulted in errors, so maybe the correct command is different.

Looking at the game's response when the user tried "pick up the bell pepper from the floor," the game said, "I only understood you as far as wanting to pick up the bell pepper." Then, when they tried "take the bell pepper from the floor," the game responded, "You can't see any such thing." So, the game is not recognizing the bell pepper as being on the floor. But the game's description of the Garden says, "There is a milk, a half of a bag of chips, a bell pepper and a shovel on the floor." So the bell pepper is indeed on the floor.

Wait, maybe the correct command is just "take the bell pepper" without specifying "from the floor," since the game might automatically know it's on the floor. Let me check the previous commands. The user first tried "pick up the bell pepper from the floor," which the game didn't recognize. Then "take the bell pepper from the floor," which also didn't work. The game says "You can't see any such thing." But according to the game's description, the bell pepper is on the floor. So maybe the correct command is just "take the bell pepper," without mentioning the floor. Alternatively, maybe the game expects the command "pick up the bell pepper" instead of "take."

Alternatively, maybe the game is case-sensitive. The user tried "pick up" and "take," but maybe the correct verb is "get" or "take." Let me think. In text adventures, common verbs are "take," "get," "pick up," "pick," etc. The user tried "pick up" and "take," but the game didn't accept them. However, the game's response when the user tried "take the bell pepper from the floor" was "You can't see any such thing." But the game's description says the bell pepper is on the floor. So perhaps the correct command is "take the bell pepper" without specifying "from the floor," because the game might already know it's on the floor. Let me try that. If the user says "take the bell pepper," maybe the game will accept it. Alternatively, maybe the game requires the player to use the exact phrase "pick up the bell pepper" without mentioning the floor. But the user tried that and it didn't work. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the game is in a state where the bell pepper is not visible, even though the description says it's on the floor. But that doesn't make sense. The game's description clearly states that the bell pepper is on the floor. So the user should be able to take it. Maybe the correct command is "take the bell pepper" without the "from the floor" part. Let me try that. The user's next action should be "take the bell pepper." If that doesn't work, maybe the game expects "pick up the bell pepper." But the user has already tried those. Alternatively, maybe the game is expecting "get the bell pepper." But the user hasn't tried that. Let me check the previous attempts again. The user tried "pick up the bell pepper from the floor" and "take the bell pepper from the floor," both of which didn't work. The game's response for "take the bell pepper from the floor" was "You can't see any such thing." But according to the game's description, the bell pepper is on the floor. So maybe the game is not recognizing the bell pepper as being there, even though it's described as such. That's confusing. Maybe there's a typo in the game's description, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use a different verb. Let me think. The correct command should be "take the bell pepper" or "pick up the bell pepper." Since the user tried both and they didn't work, maybe the game is expecting a different phrasing. Alternatively, maybe the game is in a state where the bell pepper is not visible, so the user needs to look around again. But the game's description says the bell pepper is on the floor. So the user should be able to take it. Maybe the correct command is "take the bell pepper" without the "from the floor" part. Let me try that.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to complete the game's tasks. They've picked up the bell pepper and are now trying to put it on the stove. But the game says "You can't see any such thing." Wait, earlier in the Garden, the description mentioned a milk, half a bag of chips, a bell pepper, and a shovel on the floor. But when the user tried to put the bell pepper on the stove, the game didn't recognize it. Maybe the stove isn't in the Garden. Let me check the previous locations.

The user was in the Garden, then went south to Backyard, then north back to Garden. The Garden's description now says there's a milk, half a bag of chips, and a shovel on the floor. The stove wasn't mentioned here. Earlier, in the Kitchen, there was a stove. But the user is currently in the Garden. So maybe the stove is in the Kitchen, and the user needs to go back to the Kitchen to put the bell pepper on the stove. But the user is in the Garden now. So the correct action would be to go back to the Kitchen, then put the bell pepper on the stove. But the user is stuck in the Garden, trying to put it on the stove here, which isn't present. So the next step is to go back to the Kitchen. The user needs to go north from the Garden to the Kitchen. Wait, in the Garden's description, it says "You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north." So the user should go north to the Kitchen. Then, once in the Kitchen, they can put the bell pepper on the stove. So the next action is to go north.

-= Backyard =-
You've just shown up in a backyard.

You can see a set of chairs. However, the set of chairs, like an empty set of chairs, has nothing on it. You move on, clearly done caring about TextWorld. You can make out a bbq. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can see a patio table. The patio table is typical. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is an open screen door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

Okay, let's try to figure out what's going on here. The user is in the Garden, and they have the bell pepper. The goal is to put the bell pepper on the stove. But the game says "You can't see any such thing." Wait, earlier in the Garden, the description mentioned a milk, half a bag of chips, and a shovel on the floor. The stove wasn't listed there. Maybe the stove is in another room, like the Kitchen. The user has been moving between the Garden and Backyard, but the stove is in the Kitchen. So the user needs to go back to the Kitchen to put the bell pepper on the stove. But the user is currently in the Garden. The previous attempts to go north led them back to the Backyard. So the correct action is to go north from the Garden to reach the Kitchen where the stove is. Then, once in the Kitchen, they can put the bell pepper on the stove. But the user is stuck in the Garden, trying to put it on the stove, which isn't there. So the next step is to go north to the Kitchen.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, the user is stuck in the Garden, trying to put the bell pepper on the stove, but the stove isn't visible here. They've tried going west multiple times, but it's not possible. The previous attempts to go north and south have led them between the Garden and Backyard. The key is that the stove is in the Kitchen, which is accessible via the screen door in the Backyard. However, the user can't go west from the Garden. Wait, maybe the screen door is in the Backyard, so they need to go to the Backyard first, then find the screen door leading west to the Kitchen. But the user is in the Garden, so they need to go north to the Backyard, then west through the screen door to reach the Kitchen. But the user has been trying to go west from the Garden, which isn't possible. So the correct sequence is: from the Garden, go north to the Backyard, then go west through the screen door to the Kitchen. Once in the Kitchen, the stove should be there, and they can put the bell pepper on it. The user needs to follow these steps carefully.

-= Backyard =-
You've just shown up in a backyard.

You can see a set of chairs. However, the set of chairs, like an empty set of chairs, has nothing on it. You move on, clearly done caring about TextWorld. You can make out a bbq. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can see a patio table. The patio table is typical. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is an open screen door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. It seems to be pretty usual here.

Were you looking for a refrigerator? Because look over there, it's a refrigerator. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. The counter appears to be empty. You scan the room, seeing a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is typical. On the kitchen island you make out a note. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.
