You are now playing a profound session of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First of all, ensure that the antique trunk is open. And then, recover the old key from the antique trunk in the bedroom. Then, check that the wooden door is unlocked with the old key. Then, open the wooden door. And then, move east. And then, make absolutely sure that the screen door is open. Having opened the screen door, attempt to head east. With that done, move south. Then, retrieve the apple from the floor of the garden. And then, make an attempt to venture north. If you can succeed at that, head west. With that accomplished, sit the apple on the stove inside the kitchen. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Bedroom =-
Well, here we are in a bedroom.

You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a chest drawer, so there's that. You make out a closed antique trunk in the corner. You make out a king-size bed. The king-size bed is typical. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text adventure game. The goal is to follow a series of steps to win. So far, they've opened the antique trunk and found an old key inside. But when they tried to "recover old key from antique trunk," the game didn't recognize that as a valid command.

Hmm, maybe the correct command is just "take old key" or "get old key" instead of "recover." Since the trunk is already open, the key is inside. The player needs to pick it up. The game's response was confused because "recover" isn't a standard verb here. So the next step should be to take the key from the trunk.

Wait, the user's previous action was "recover old key from antique trunk," which the game rejected. The correct action is probably "take old key" or "get old key." Let me check the game's possible commands. In TextWorld, common verbs are "take," "get," "use," "open," "close," etc. So the right command here is to take the key.

So the next action should be "take old key" or "get old key." But the user might have used "recover" instead of "take." So the correct command is "take old key." Let me make sure that's the right move. Once the key is taken, the next step is to unlock the wooden door with it. So after taking the key, the player should use it on the door.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text adventure game. They need to follow a series of steps to win. So far, they've opened the antique trunk, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door, and now the next step is to open the wooden door. Wait, the previous action was unlocking the door, so the next logical step would be to open it. The user's last action was unlocking the door, which probably allows them to pass through. Then, after opening the door, they need to move east, check the screen door, etc.

But the user is asking if they're on the right track. The current location is the bedroom, and after opening the door, they should move east. The next step in the original instructions was to move east after opening the door. So the next command should be "go east" or "move east". But the user's last action was unlocking the door, so the next step is to open it. Wait, the wooden door was already unlocked, so maybe the next step is to open it. But in the game's context, unlocking might be different from opening. Maybe the door is locked and needs to be unlocked, then opened. But the user already unlocked it, so now they need to open it. However, the game might automatically open it once unlocked. Alternatively, the user might need to push or pull it. But according to the original instructions, after unlocking, the next step is to open the wooden door. So the correct command here would be "open wooden door". But the user just unlocked it, so maybe they need to open it. However, the game might have specific verbs. Let me check the previous steps.

The user previously did "unlock wooden door with old key", and the response was "You unlock wooden door." Then the next step is to open it. So the next command should be "open wooden door". But the user is at the bedroom, and the wooden door leads east. So after opening the door, they can move east. But the user is asking if they're close to the goal. The original plan was to move east after opening the door. So the next action should be "open wooden door" to proceed. But the user might have already done that. Wait, the user's last action was unlocking the door, and the next step is to open it. So the correct next command is "open wooden door".

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text adventure game. They've followed the steps correctly so far. Let me recap the current state.

They started in the bedroom, opened the antique trunk, took the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, then went east to the kitchen. Now, in the kitchen, they found a note on the kitchen island. The next steps according to the original plan were to make sure the screen door is open, then go east, then south, retrieve the apple from the garden, etc.

But in the kitchen, the user has to check the screen door. The current description mentions a closed screen door leading east and an open wooden door west. So the next logical step is to open the screen door. The user's next action should be to open it. Then, after that, they can try going east again. But the user's last action was "go east" which led them to the kitchen. Now, they need to open the screen door first. So the correct next command is "open screen door".

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game, and they've followed a series of steps to get to the backyard. The goal is to retrieve the apple from the garden, sit it on the stove in the kitchen, and then win. So far, they've opened the antique trunk, gotten the key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, went east to the kitchen, opened the screen door, and went east again to the backyard.

Now, the current location is the backyard. The next step in the original plan was to move south after opening the screen door. But the user just went east from the kitchen to the backyard. The backyard has an exit to the south, which is unguarded. The next step according to the original instructions was to move south after opening the screen door. Wait, the user's last action was "go east" from the kitchen, which led them to the backyard. Now, they need to move south from the backyard to reach the garden where the apple is. The original plan said: "Then, move south. Then, retrieve the apple from the floor of the garden. And then, make an attempt to venture north. If you can succeed at that, head west. With that accomplished, sit the apple on the stove inside the kitchen. And once you've done that, you win!"

So, from the backyard, moving south would take them to the garden. Then they can retrieve the apple. The user is now in the backyard, and the next action should be to go south. The user's last action was "go east", which brought them to the backyard. Now, they need to go south from there. The current location's description mentions an exit to the south. So the correct next step is to move south. The user's next command should be "go south".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the steps in the TextWorld game. They've opened the antique trunk, taken the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, went east to the kitchen, opened the screen door, went east again to the backyard, and then tried to go south to the garden. In the garden, there's an apple on the floor. The user tried to take the apple but got a message saying they can't see any such thing. 

Wait, the prompt says there's a lettuce, tomato plant, apple, and shovel on the floor. So the apple is there. Maybe the command was "take apple from floor", but the game says it can't see any such thing. Maybe the correct command is just "take apple" without specifying the floor, since the apple is on the floor by default. Or perhaps the game expects a different phrasing. The user might need to use "take apple" instead of "take apple from floor". Let me check the previous steps. The user was told to "retrieve the apple from the floor of the garden." So the correct action is to take the apple from the floor. But the game's response says "You can't see any such thing." Maybe the apple isn't visible, or the command is incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to look around first. But according to the game's setup, the apple is on the floor. So the correct command should be "take apple from floor", but the game doesn't recognize it. Maybe the game expects "take apple" without the "from floor" part. Let me think. In TextWorld, sometimes you just need to take the object directly. So maybe the correct command is "take apple". The user tried "take apple from floor" and it didn't work. So the next step is to try "take apple" instead.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text adventure game. They've followed the steps given in the initial instructions. Let me recap the steps to make sure they're on track.

First, they needed to open the antique trunk in the bedroom, which they did. Then recover the old key from the trunk. They took the key. Next, unlock and open the wooden door. Then move east to the kitchen. They opened the screen door and went east to the backyard. Then they went south to the garden, found the apple, took it, and tried to go north. But now they're back in the backyard, and the next step according to the original plan was to sit the apple on the stove in the kitchen. 

Wait, the user just went north from the garden, which took them back to the backyard. The apple is in their inventory now. The next step was to go west to the kitchen, then put the apple on the stove. But in the current location (backyard), the exit to the west is the screen door. So they need to go west back to the kitchen, then interact with the stove. 

But the user's last action was "go north", which brought them back to the backyard. Now they need to head west to the kitchen. The next command should be "go west" to reach the kitchen again. Then, once in the kitchen, they can put the apple on the stove. The original goal was to sit the apple on the stove inside the kitchen and then win. So the correct sequence is: from the garden, go north to backyard, then go west to kitchen, then put apple on stove. 

But the user is currently in the backyard. So the next action should be "go west" to the kitchen. Then, in the kitchen, they can use the command "put apple on stove". However, the user's last input was "go north", which led them back to the backyard. The current location is the backyard, so the next step is to go west to the kitchen. Therefore, the correct next command is "go west".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in this text-based game. They started by opening the antique trunk, taking the old key, unlocking and opening the wooden door, then moving east. They ended up in the kitchen, opened the screen door, went east to the backyard, then south to the garden where they picked up the apple. Now they're back in the kitchen, then west to the bedroom again.

The original goal was to eventually sit the apple on the stove in the kitchen and win. The user has the apple now, but they're back in the bedroom. The next step should be to go back to the kitchen, then to the stove. But in the current state, they're in the bedroom. So the correct action would be to go west again to get back to the kitchen. Wait, but the user just came from the kitchen to the bedroom. The kitchen has an open wooden door leading west, and the bedroom has an open wooden door leading east. So to get back to the kitchen, they need to go west from the bedroom. But the user is in the bedroom, so the next command should be "go west" to return to the kitchen. Then, from the kitchen, they can go north to the stove area. But the user's last action was "go west" to the bedroom, so the next step is to go west again? Wait, no. Wait, the user is in the bedroom, and the kitchen is west of the bedroom. So from the bedroom, going west leads back to the kitchen. So the next action should be "go west" to return to the kitchen.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game where they have to follow a series of steps to win. The goal is to eventually sit the apple on the stove in the kitchen and win.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the kitchen again. They have the apple, which they picked up in the garden. The previous steps involved moving around different rooms: bedroom, kitchen, backyard, garden, and back to the kitchen. The user has already completed most of the required steps: opened the antique trunk, got the key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, moved east, opened the screen door, went east to the garden, took the apple, and then tried to go north but ended up back in the kitchen.

Now, the next step according to the original plan was to "venture north" from the garden, then west, sit the apple on the stove. But in the garden, after taking the apple, the user tried to go north, which led them back to the kitchen. So maybe they need to go west from the kitchen again? But earlier, when they tried to go west from the kitchen, they ended up in the bedroom, which had the antique trunk again. But the trunk was already opened and the key was taken.

Wait, the user has the apple. The next step was to go north from the garden, but that led back to the kitchen. Then, maybe they need to go west from the kitchen to the bedroom again? But the bedroom's west exit is blocked. Alternatively, maybe they need to go north from the kitchen? The kitchen has an unblocked exit to the north. But the original plan said after going east from the garden, they should venture north, then west. But perhaps the user is stuck in a loop between kitchen and bedroom.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go south from the kitchen? The kitchen has an exit to the south, which would take them back to the backyard. Then from the backyard, go west to the kitchen again. But the user already has the apple. The apple is supposed to be placed on the stove in the kitchen. So maybe the user needs to go to the kitchen, then find the stove, and put the apple on it.

Wait, in the kitchen description, there's a stove. The user has the apple. So the next step should be to go to the stove and place the apple there. But how? The user is currently in the kitchen. The stove is mentioned as being there. So maybe the user needs to "put apple on stove" or something similar. But the available commands are limited to movement. The user has to use the correct command to interact with the stove.

But in the game's previous steps, the user had to use commands like "take apple", "open screen door", etc. So maybe the correct command here is to "put apple on stove". However, the user's previous action was "go east" which led them back to the kitchen. Now, they are in the kitchen again. The stove is in the kitchen. So the next step is to put the apple on the stove. But the user hasn't done that yet. The user has the apple, so they need to interact with the stove.

But the game's commands might require the user to first go to the stove's location. However, in the kitchen, the stove is already present. So the user can directly interact with it. Therefore, the next action should be to "put apple on stove". But the user's previous actions were movement commands. The game might require the user to use the correct verb here. So the correct command would be "put apple on stove".
