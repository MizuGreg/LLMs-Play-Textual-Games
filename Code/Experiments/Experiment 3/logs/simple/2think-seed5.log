You are now playing a life changing session of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First thing I need you to do is to assure that the chest drawer in the bedroom is open. Then, retrieve the old key from the chest drawer in the bedroom. After that, unlock the wooden door with the old key. And then, ensure that the wooden door in the bedroom is open. After that, make an attempt to move east. Following that, open the refrigerator. And then, pick up the apple from the refrigerator. After that, rest the apple on the stove. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Bedroom =-
You are in a bedroom. A normal one. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You make out a chest drawer. You can make out an antique trunk. You smell a wretched smell, and follow it to a king-size bed. The king-size bed is standard. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing a text-based game where they need to follow a series of steps to win. The current situation is in the bedroom. The user first tried to "open chest drawer", which worked. Then they tried "retrieve old key from chest drawer", but the system said that's not a recognized verb.

Hmm, so maybe the correct command isn't "retrieve" but something else. In text adventures, common verbs are "take", "get", "pick up", etc. Since the key is in the chest drawer, after opening it, the user should use "take" or "get" to pick up the key. The previous attempt used "retrieve", which might not be a valid command here. The system's response indicates that "retrieve" isn't a recognized verb, so the user needs to use the correct command.

The user is asking if they're on the right track and what their next action should be. The next step after getting the key is to unlock the wooden door with the key. But first, they need to pick up the key correctly. So the correct action here is to "take old key from chest drawer" or "get old key from chest drawer". Since the system might expect "take", that's probably the right command. Then, after getting the key, they can use it to unlock the door. So the next action should be "take old key from chest drawer".

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text adventure game. Their goal is to open the chest drawer, get the old key, unlock the wooden door, open the door, move east, open the fridge, pick up the apple, put it on the stove, and win.

So far, they've done the first three steps: opened the chest drawer, took the key, unlocked the door. The next step according to the instructions is to ensure the wooden door is open. Wait, the door was just unlocked, but maybe it's not open yet? Or maybe they need to open it further? The user's last action was unlocking the door, so the next logical step would be to open it. But in some games, unlocking and opening are separate actions. Let me check the previous messages.

The user said: "Then, unlock the wooden door with the old key. And then, ensure that the wooden door in the bedroom is open." So after unlocking, they need to open it. So the next action should be "open wooden door". But the user might have already done that. Wait, the user's last action was unlocking the door, and the response was "You unlock wooden door." Then the next step is to open it. So the correct next command is "open wooden door". But the user is asking if they're close to the goal. The score is at 3/4, so they need to do four more steps. Wait, the original instructions said after unlocking the door, ensure it's open. Then move east, open fridge, pick apple, rest on stove.

So the next step after unlocking is to open the door. Then move east. So the next command should be "open wooden door". But the user might have already done that. Wait, the user's last action was unlocking the door, and the next step is to open it. So the correct next action is "open wooden door". But the user is asking if they're close. The score is 3/4, so they need to do three more steps. Wait, maybe the score is 3/4, meaning 4 steps total? Let me check the history.

Original task steps: 1. Open chest drawer. 2. Retrieve key. 3. Unlock door. 4. Ensure door is open. 5. Move east. 6. Open fridge. 7. Pick apple. 8. Rest apple on stove. So the score is 3/4, meaning they've done 3 out of 8 steps? Or maybe the score is tracking progress towards the goal. The user is at step 3 (unlocked door), so next is step 4: open door. Then step 5: move east. Then step 6: open fridge. Then step 7: pick apple. Then step 8: rest on stove. So the next action is "open wooden door".

Ah, the kitchen. This is some kind of kitchen, really great standard vibes in this place, a wonderful standard atmosphere. And now, well, you're in it.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a refrigerator. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. The counter appears to be empty. You see a stove. The stove is usual. But there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is standard. On the kitchen island you see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

Okay, let's see. The user has to open the refrigerator. They're in the kitchen now. The previous steps were unlocking and opening the wooden door to get here. The next step was going east, which led them to the kitchen. Now, the task is to open the refrigerator.

Looking at the description, the refrigerator is closed. The user needs to open it. The available actions here are to interact with the refrigerator. The correct command would be "open refrigerator". Let me check if that's the right verb. The user has been using commands like "open chest drawer" and "unlock wooden door", so "open refrigerator" makes sense. The score is increasing, so each correct action adds a point. The user is on track, so the next step is to open the fridge. Then, pick up the apple from there. So the next action should be opening the refrigerator.

Okay, let's see. The user has to pick up the apple from the refrigerator and then rest it on the stove. So far, they've opened the refrigerator, taken the apple. Next step is to put the apple on the stove.

But wait, the current location is the kitchen. The stove is mentioned as being in the kitchen. So the next action should be to go to the stove. But how do they get there? The kitchen has a kitchen island, a stove, a refrigerator, and exits in different directions. The user is currently in the kitchen, so they need to go to the stove. But the available commands might be "go to stove" or "rest apple on stove".

Wait, the previous action was taking the apple from the refrigerator. Now, the next step is to rest the apple on the stove. The user needs to place the apple on the stove. So the correct command would be "rest apple on stove". But I need to check if that's a valid command in the game's context. Alternatively, maybe they need to go to the stove first. But the game's previous responses suggest that actions like "rest apple on stove" are possible. Let me check the history.

In the kitchen, the user is in the kitchen, and the stove is present. The user has the apple. So the next step is to rest the apple on the stove. The correct command would be "rest apple on stove". The user has already taken the apple, so now they need to place it. The game's previous interaction had the user take the apple, and now they need to rest it. So the next action should be "rest apple on stove".

Okay, the user is trying to rest the apple on the stove. The previous attempt didn't work because "rest" isn't a valid verb here. Let me think about possible commands. Maybe "put" is the correct verb. So instead of "rest apple on stove," it should be "put apple on stove." That makes more sense in the context of the game. Let me check if that's the right action. The goal was to rest the apple on the stove, so using "put" would be the appropriate command. I'll go with that.
