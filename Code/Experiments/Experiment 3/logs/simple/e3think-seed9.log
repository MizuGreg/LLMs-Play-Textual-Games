Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First, it would be good if you could open the chest drawer within the bedroom. And then, take the old key from the chest drawer within the bedroom. With the old key, unlock the wooden door. Then, ensure that the wooden door within the bedroom is open. After that, make an effort to head east. If you can accomplish that, open the refrigerator inside the kitchen. After that, recover the lettuce from the refrigerator in the kitchen. After that, rest the lettuce on the stove. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Bedroom =-
You're now in the bedroom. Let's see what's in here.

You can make out a closed chest drawer. You see an antique trunk. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You make out a king-size bed. The king-size bed is normal. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, let me see. The user has been following the steps to open the chest drawer, take the old key, unlock the wooden door, and now the door is unlocked. The next step according to the original task was to ensure the wooden door is open. Since they just unlocked it, maybe they need to check if it's open. But the game might automatically consider it open after unlocking. Then, the next action was to head east. So after unlocking, the next step is to go east. The user's next action should be "go east" to proceed to the kitchen. Let me confirm the previous steps: the user has unlocked the door, so now they need to move east. The next step in the task is to open the refrigerator in the kitchen. So the correct command here is "go east".

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. An usual one.

A closed refrigerator is here. You scan the room for a counter, and you find a counter. The counter is ordinary. But the thing is empty. You move on, clearly infuriated by your TextWorld experience. You see a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You see a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island, so there's that.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the kitchen now. The task was to open the refrigerator in the kitchen after heading east. The user just went east, which led them to the kitchen. The next step is to open the refrigerator. The game environment mentions a closed refrigerator here. So the correct action would be to open it. The user's previous action was "go east", which brought them to the kitchen, so now they need to "open refrigerator" to proceed. Let me check the previous steps again. The user had to open the fridge after going east, so the next command should be "open refrigerator".

Okay, the user tried to "rest lettuce on stove" but the game said that's not a recognized verb. So I need to figure out the correct command. Let me think about the possible actions here. The user has the lettuce, and the goal is to rest it on the stove. Maybe the correct command is "put lettuce on stove" instead of "rest". Since "rest" isn't a valid verb here, "put" would be the right action. Let me check the previous commands. The user had to take the lettuce from the fridge, then put it on the stove. So the next step is to use "put" instead of "rest". That should work.
