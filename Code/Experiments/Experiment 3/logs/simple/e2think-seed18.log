Welcome to TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, you could, like, open the chest drawer. Then, pick up the old key from the chest drawer. After picking up the old key, assure that the wooden door is unlocked. Then, ensure that the wooden door is open. After pulling open the wooden door, take a trip east. And then, make sure that the screen door is wide open. After that, make an effort to move east. With that done, attempt to take a trip south. Then, pick-up the bell pepper from the floor of the garden. And then, attempt to go to the north. If you can succeed at that, make an effort to take a trip west. And then, rest the bell pepper on the stove. Got that? Good!

-= Bedroom =-
You are in a bedroom. A standard kind of place.

You can make out a chest drawer. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You see a closed antique trunk close by. Look over there! a king-size bed. The king-size bed appears to be empty.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game called TextWorld. Their task is to follow a series of steps to reach a goal. So far, they've opened the chest drawer, picked up the old key, and the score is up to 2 out of 3. The next step according to the initial instructions was to assure that the wooden door is unlocked.

Wait, the user has the old key. The wooden door is closed, but they need to unlock it. Since they have the key, they should use it to unlock the door. The next action should be to unlock the door. But how? In text games, usually, you'd use the key on the door. So the command would be "unlock the wooden door" or "use the old key on the wooden door". But the game's commands might be more specific. Let me check the previous actions. The user was told to "assure that the wooden door is unlocked" after picking up the key. So the next step is to unlock it. The correct command here is likely "unlock the wooden door" or "use the old key on the wooden door". But since the user has the key, they need to use it on the door. So the next action should be "unlock the wooden door" using the key. But the game might require the exact phrase. Let me think. The user has the key, so they need to use it on the door. The correct command would be "use the old key on the wooden door" or "unlock the wooden door". But in the game's context, maybe "unlock the wooden door" is sufficient. However, since the key is in hand, the game might require using the key. So the next action is to unlock the door with the key. Therefore, the command should be "unlock the wooden door".

Okay, let's see. The user has progressed through the steps so far. They opened the chest drawer, picked up the key, unlocked the wooden door, and opened it. The next step in the original goal was to "make sure that the screen door is wide open." Wait, after opening the wooden door, they needed to check the screen door. But in the current scene, they're in the bedroom, and after opening the wooden door leading east, they might now be in the next room. But the next step according to the initial instructions was to "make sure that the screen door is wide open." However, the user's last action was opening the wooden door, which leads east. Now, they need to check the screen door. But maybe the screen door is in the same room or the next room. Alternatively, maybe after opening the wooden door, they need to move east and then check the screen door. Wait, the original steps said: after pulling open the wooden door, take a trip east. Then make sure the screen door is wide open. So after opening the door, they need to go east, then check the screen door. But the user is in the bedroom, and the wooden door leads east. So after opening it, they should go east. Then, in the next room, there might be a screen door. So the next action is to move east. But the user's last action was opening the wooden door, so the next step is to go east. Then, once in the next room, check the screen door. But the user's current location is after opening the door. So the next command should be "go east" to move into the next room. Then, in that room, they need to make sure the screen door is open. So the next action is "go east".

You arrive in a kitchen. A standard one.

You see a refrigerator. You check the price tag that's still affixed to the refrigerator. 100 bucks? What a deal! You'll have to ask where they got this! You see a counter. The counter is typical. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. Look over there! a kitchen island. You wonder idly who left that here. The kitchen island is usual. On the kitchen island you see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

Okay, the user is in the Kitchen scene. The previous action was trying to "make sure that the screen door is wide open," but the game didn't recognize that as a valid command. The user needs to figure out the correct way to interact with the screen door.

Looking at the current environment description, there's a closed screen door leading east and an open wooden door west. The user's goal is to ensure the screen door is wide open. Since the screen door is closed, the correct action would be to open it. But the game might use specific verbs like "open" or "unlock." The user previously used "unlock" for the wooden door, so maybe "open" is the right verb here.

The user's next step should be to attempt to open the screen door. The command should be "open the screen door" or "open screen door." Since the game might require the exact phrasing, "open the screen door" is more likely correct. The user needs to try that command now.

You can see a patio table. The patio table is normal. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

There is an open screen door leading west. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Backyard scene. They've already completed several steps: opened the chest drawer, picked up the key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, went east to the Kitchen, opened the screen door, and then went east again to the Backyard. The current score is 7/8.

The original goal was to follow a series of steps. The next step after making sure the screen door is open was to "attempt to move east." The user just came from the screen door leading west, so moving east from here would be the next logical step. But in the Backyard description, the open screen door is west, and the prompt says "you should try going south" if looking for an unguarded exit. However, the user's previous action was going east from the Kitchen to the Backyard. Now, the next step in the original instructions was to "make an effort to move east" after ensuring the screen door is open. But in the Backyard, the user is already east of the screen door. Wait, maybe the next step is to go south from the Backyard. The original goal said after opening the screen door, move east, then attempt to go south. But the user is now in the Backyard. The next step might be to go south. Let me check the original task again.

Original task steps: After pulling open the wooden door, take a trip east. Then, make sure screen door is wide open. Then, attempt to move east. Then, attempt to go south. Then, pick up bell pepper from garden. Then go north, then west, then rest bell pepper on stove.

So after the screen door is open, the user needs to move east again. But in the Backyard, moving east might not be possible. The Backyard's description says there's an open screen door west and suggests trying south. So maybe the next step is to go south from the Backyard. That would be the next command. The user's current location is Backyard, and the next step is to go south. So the correct command is "go south".

So after picking up the bell pepper, they need to move north. The current location is the Garden, and the prompt mentions that north is unblocked. So the next command should be "go north." Then, after moving north, they need to "make an effort to take a trip west" and finally "rest the bell pepper on the stove." But the immediate next step is to go north.

Okay, the user is in the Kitchen and tried to "rest the bell pepper on the stove," but the game didn't recognize that as a valid command. The correct action here would be to place the bell pepper on the stove. Since the user has the bell pepper, they need to use the correct verb. In text adventures, the typical command would be "put the bell pepper on the stove." But maybe the game expects a different phrasing. Alternatively, since the stove is mentioned, perhaps "put the bell pepper on the stove" is the right command. The user might need to use "put" instead of "rest."
