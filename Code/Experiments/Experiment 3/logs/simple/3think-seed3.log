Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First step, look and see that the chest drawer within the bedroom is opened. And then, recover the old key from the chest drawer inside the bedroom. And then, unlock the wooden door. Then, open the wooden door within the bedroom. And then, go east. That done, open the refrigerator within the kitchen. After that, recover the apple from the refrigerator. Then, put the apple on the stove. Got that? Good!

-= Bedroom =-
You are in a bedroom. A normal kind of place.

You can make out a closed chest drawer in the corner. Oh, great. Here's an antique trunk. You can see a king-size bed. However, the king-size bed, like an empty king-size bed, has nothing on it.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me see. The user is playing this text-based game, and they've been following the instructions step by step. The current scene is the bedroom. They've already opened the chest drawer, taken the old key, and the score is now 2 out of 3. The next step according to the initial instructions was to unlock the wooden door. But the user might be confused because the door is closed.

Wait, the user tried to "recover old key from chest drawer" but the system said that's not a valid verb. Then they corrected to "take old key from chest drawer", which worked. Now, the next step is to unlock the door. But how do you unlock a door in this game? Typically, you'd use the key. So the next action should be to unlock the wooden door with the key. But the game might require the exact command. The door is closed and leads east. So maybe the command is "unlock wooden door" or "use key on wooden door". But the user has the key now, so they need to use it on the door. Let me check the previous steps again.

The user was told to "unlock the wooden door. Then, open the wooden door within the bedroom." So after unlocking, they need to open it. But maybe the game requires "unlock" as the command. Alternatively, maybe "open" the door after unlocking. But the user has the key, so the correct action is to unlock the door. The next step is to unlock the door. So the command should be "unlock wooden door". Let me make sure that's the right verb here. Since the door is closed, using the key to unlock it makes sense. So the next action is "unlock wooden door".

-= Kitchen =-
You've stumbled into a normal room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be normal. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the kitchen. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You can make out a closed refrigerator. You can make out a counter. You shudder, but continue examining the counter. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. You can make out a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? The stove appears to be empty. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a kitchen island. The kitchen island is usual. On the kitchen island you make out a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps given. They started in the bedroom, opened the chest drawer, took the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, then went east to the kitchen. Now they're in the kitchen, and the next step was to open the refrigerator.

The user's current location is the kitchen, and the next task is to open the refrigerator. The previous actions have been successful, so the next logical step is to open the refrigerator. The user needs to perform the command "open refrigerator" to proceed. Since the user has already done the steps up to this point, the next action should be straightforward. I need to make sure that the command is correctly formatted and matches the game's expected input. The user has been following the instructions closely, so "open refrigerator" is the correct next step.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps to complete the game. So far, they've opened the chest drawer, taken the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, gone east into the kitchen, opened the refrigerator, took the apple. Now they need to put the apple on the stove.

The next step according to the original instructions was to "put the apple on the stove." The user has the apple in their inventory now. So the correct command here would be to use the "put" verb. But in the game's context, the command might need to be phrased as "put apple on stove" or "put the apple on the stove." Since the game's previous commands used "take" and "open," it's likely that "put" is the correct verb here. The user needs to specify the object and the target, so "put apple on stove" seems appropriate. I should make sure there's no typo and that the command matches the game's expected input.
