Welcome to TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, you could, like, open the chest drawer. Then, pick up the old key from the chest drawer. After picking up the old key, assure that the wooden door is unlocked. Then, ensure that the wooden door is open. After pulling open the wooden door, take a trip east. And then, make sure that the screen door is wide open. After that, make an effort to move east. With that done, attempt to take a trip south. Then, pick-up the bell pepper from the floor of the garden. And then, attempt to go to the north. If you can succeed at that, make an effort to take a trip west. And then, rest the bell pepper on the stove. Got that? Good!

-= Bedroom =-
You are in a bedroom. A standard kind of place.

You can make out a chest drawer. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You see a closed antique trunk close by. Look over there! a king-size bed. The king-size bed appears to be empty.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. A standard one.

You see a refrigerator. You check the price tag that's still affixed to the refrigerator. 100 bucks? What a deal! You'll have to ask where they got this! You see a counter. The counter is typical. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. Look over there! a kitchen island. You wonder idly who left that here. The kitchen island is usual. On the kitchen island you see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

You've entered a backyard. You can barely contain your excitement.

You scan the room for a set of chairs, and you find a set of chairs! The set of chairs is typical. But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? What's that over there? It looks like it's a bbq. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a bbq, go to TextWorld. However, the bbq, like an empty bbq, has nothing on it. You can see a patio table. The patio table is normal. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

There is an open screen door leading west. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they have to follow a series of steps to complete a task. So far, they've opened the chest drawer, picked up the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, went east to the kitchen, opened the screen door, went east again to the backyard, then south to the garden, picked up the bell pepper, and went north back to the backyard. Their current score is 9/11, and they're asking if they're on the right track and if they're close to the goal.

First, I need to recall the original task. The user's instructions were to: open the chest drawer, pick up the old key, unlock and open the wooden door, go east, open the screen door, go east again, then go south to the garden, pick up the bell pepper, go north, then west, and rest the bell pepper on the stove. So far, they've done all the steps up to picking up the bell pepper in the garden. The next step after that was to go north, which they did, leading them back to the backyard. Now, the next step in the original plan was to go west from the garden after picking up the bell pepper. But in the current state, they're in the backyard again after going north. Wait, maybe there's a confusion in the path.

Wait, after picking up the bell pepper in the garden (step 8/10), the next step was to attempt to go north. They did that, which took them back to the backyard (step 9/11). Now, the next step according to the original plan was to go west from the garden. But they're in the backyard now. So perhaps they need to go south from the backyard to get back to the garden, then go west. But the user's current location is the backyard. The backyard has an open screen door leading west and a path south. So maybe the next step is to go south back to the garden, then west. But the user's next action would be to go west from the garden after picking up the bell pepper. However, in the current state, they're in the backyard. So perhaps they need to go south to the garden again, then west. But the user's current position is the backyard. So the next action should be to go south to return to the garden. Then, from the garden, go west. But the user's last action was going north from the garden to the backyard. So they need to go south back to the garden, then west. But the user's next move would be to go south. However, the user's current location is the backyard, so the next step is to go south to the garden. Then, from the garden, go west. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action should be to go south from the backyard to the garden. Then, from the garden, go west. But the user's current location is the backyard. Therefore, the next action is to go south. But the user is asking if they're close to the goal. They have completed most of the steps, but they need to go west from the garden after picking up the bell pepper. Since they are in the backyard now, they need to go south to the garden again, then west. So the next action should be to go south. However, the user's current position is the backyard, so the next step is to go south. Therefore, the correct next action is to go south.

<think>
Okay, the user is stuck in the game. They've reached the garden, picked up the bell pepper, and tried to go west but couldn't. The next step was to rest the bell pepper on the stove, but the system doesn't recognize "rest" as a verb. The user has tried "rest" multiple times, but it's not working. Let me check the possible commands.

In TextWorld, verbs are usually action words like "take", "put", "use", "open", "close", etc. The user is trying to "rest" the bell pepper on the stove. Maybe the correct verb is "put" instead of "rest". The game might not recognize "rest" as a valid action here. So the user should try "put the bell pepper on the stove" instead. But the system only accepts the command as a single word. Wait, the user's previous attempts were just "rest the bell pepper on the stove", but the system says it's not a verb. Maybe the correct command is "put" without the object. Or perhaps "place" is the verb. Alternatively, maybe the stove is a container, and the user needs to use "put" to place the bell pepper on it.

Looking back at the game's previous interactions, the user was told to "rest the bell pepper on the stove". But the game's response indicates that "rest" isn't a recognized verb. So the user needs to use the correct verb. The correct action here is likely "put" the bell pepper on the stove. So the next action should be "put the bell pepper on the stove". However, the system might require just the verb "put" followed by the object. But in the game's context, maybe the correct command is "put the bell pepper on the stove". But the user has tried "rest" and it's not working. So the correct verb here is "put". Therefore, the next action should be "put the bell pepper on the stove".

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

<think>
Okay, the user is stuck again. They've tried putting the bell pepper on the stove multiple times, but the game says they can't see the stove. Let me check the game environment again.

In the Garden description, the user sees a half of a bag of chips, a bell pepper, an apple, and a shovel on the floor. There's no mention of a stove here. The previous location was the Backyard, then the Garden. The stove might be in the Kitchen or another area. The user was in the Garden after going south from the Backyard. But the stove isn't listed in the Garden. Maybe the stove is in the Kitchen, which they visited earlier. But they were in the Garden now. Wait, the original task said to rest the bell pepper on the stove. If the stove isn't in the current location, maybe they need to go back to the Kitchen. But how?

The user is in the Garden. The Garden's description says you can go north to the Backyard. The Backyard has an open screen door leading west and a path south. The Kitchen was earlier, but they might have to go back through the Backyard to the Kitchen. But the user is in the Garden. So the next step would be to go north to the Backyard, then maybe west to the Kitchen? But the user's last action was going west from the Garden, which wasn't possible. Wait, the user tried to go west from the Garden but couldn't. Maybe the stove is in the Kitchen, so they need to go back to the Kitchen. But how? From the Garden, going north takes them to the Backyard. Then, from the Backyard, going west leads to the screen door, which might lead to the Kitchen. But the user needs to find the stove there. However, the user is stuck because they can't see the stove in the Garden. So the correct action is to go back to the Kitchen where the stove is. But the user is in the Garden. So the next step is to go north to the Backyard, then west to the Kitchen. But the user's current location is the Garden. So the next command should be "go north" to get back to the Backyard. Then, from there, go west to the Kitchen. But the user's last action was trying to go west from the Garden, which wasn't possible. So the correct next action is to go north to the Backyard. Then, from the Backyard, go west to the Kitchen. Then, in the Kitchen, the stove would be there. So the user needs to navigate back to the Kitchen. But the user is in the Garden, so the first step is to go north to the Backyard. Then, from the Backyard, go west to the Kitchen. Then, in the Kitchen, put the bell pepper on the stove. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action is to go north from the Garden to the Backyard. Then, from the Backyard, go west to the Kitchen. Then, in the Kitchen, put the bell pepper on the stove. But the user is currently in the Garden, so the next command is "go north".

-= Backyard =-
You've entered a backyard. You can barely contain your excitement.

You scan the room for a set of chairs, and you find a set of chairs! The set of chairs is typical. But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? What's that over there? It looks like it's a bbq. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a bbq, go to TextWorld. However, the bbq, like an empty bbq, has nothing on it. You can see a patio table. The patio table is normal. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

There is an open screen door leading west. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. A standard one.

You see a refrigerator. You check the price tag that's still affixed to the refrigerator. 100 bucks? What a deal! You'll have to ask where they got this! You see a counter. The counter is typical. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. Look over there! a kitchen island. You wonder idly who left that here. The kitchen island is usual. On the kitchen island you see a note.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.
