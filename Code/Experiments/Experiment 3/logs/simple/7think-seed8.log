Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, doublecheck that the antique trunk in the bedroom is open. Then, pick up the old key from the antique trunk. Then, make it so that the wooden door within the bedroom is unlocked. Then, open the wooden door. After opening the wooden door, venture east. Then, open the screen door. Then, make an attempt to head east. That done, take a trip south. Then, pick up the milk from the floor of the garden. After getting the milk, try to head north. That done, attempt to take a trip west. Then, sit the milk on the stove in the kitchen. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Bedroom =-
You find yourself in a bedroom. An usual one. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You can see a chest drawer. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's an antique trunk. Were you looking for a king-size bed? Because look over there, it's a king-size bed. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

You are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.

You make out a closed refrigerator in the corner. You make out a counter. The counter is normal. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a stove. The stove is ordinary. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can see a kitchen island. Now why would someone leave that there? On the kitchen island you see a note. You shudder, but continue examining the room.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what to do next. The user is in the kitchen, and they tried to go east but were told they need to open the screen door first. The current score is 5/7, so they've done most of the steps mentioned.

The original goal was to pick up the milk from the garden, then go north, then west, and put the milk on the stove. But the user is now in the kitchen. Wait, the previous step was venturing east from the bedroom, which led to the kitchen. Now, in the kitchen, there's a closed screen door leading east. The user needs to open that screen door before going east again.

But the user's next action should be to open the screen door. However, the user might be confused because they were told to open the screen door first. So the correct next step is to open the screen door. Then, after that, they can go east again. But the user's last action was "go east" which didn't work because the screen door was closed. So the next command should be "open screen door".

Wait, the user's last input was "go east" which resulted in the message that the screen door needs to be opened. So the correct next action is to open the screen door. Then, after opening it, they can go east again. So the next command should be "open screen door".

-= Backyard =-
You've just sauntered into a backyard.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a set of chairs. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Sometimes, just sometimes, TextWorld can just be the worst. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a bbq. But the thing is empty. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a patio table. But the thing is empty.

There is an open screen door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they need to follow a series of steps to complete a task. So far, they've done most of the required actions: opened the trunk, picked up the key, unlocked and opened the bedroom door, went east to the kitchen, opened the screen door, went east again to the backyard, then south to the garden, picked up the milk, and tried to go north again. Now they're back in the backyard, and the next step according to the original instructions was to "attempt to take a trip west" after going north. But the user is currently in the backyard, and the screen door leading west is open. 

Wait, the original plan was after getting the milk, try to head north, then attempt to take a trip west. But in the current state, the user is in the backyard, and the screen door west is open. So the next logical step would be to go west from the backyard. However, the user's last action was going north, which brought them back to the backyard. The next step should be to go west through the screen door. But the user might have gotten confused because they kept going north and south, looping between the garden and backyard. 

Looking at the current location, the user is in the Backyard, and the open screen door leads west. So the correct next action is to go west. The user might have been trying to navigate back to the kitchen or garden, but the next step is indeed to go west from the backyard. The user needs to follow the exact steps: after getting the milk, go north, then west. But since they're already in the backyard, going west is the next step. So the correct command is "go west".
