Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, you could, like, ensure that the chest drawer is open. And then, take the old key from the chest drawer inside the bedroom. With the old key, doublecheck that the wooden door is unlocked. And then, open the wooden door within the bedroom. Then, attempt to go east. Then, make absolutely sure that the screen door inside the kitchen is opened. And then, attempt to venture east. Next, travel south. And then, lift the half of a bag of chips from the floor of the garden. Then, make an effort to move north. If you can finish that, venture west. And then, rest the half of a bag of chips on the stove. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Bedroom =-
You've just sauntered into a bedroom. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

You can see a chest drawer. You can see an antique trunk. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You see a king-size bed. The king-size bed is usual. The king-size bed appears to be empty.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

<think>
Okay, let me see. The user is playing this TextWorld game and has followed a series of steps. They started in the bedroom, opened the chest drawer, took the old key, unlocked the wooden door, and then had to open it before going east. They did open the door, and now they're at the next part.

The task was to go east from the bedroom, then check the kitchen screen door, go east again, travel south, pick up the bag of chips, move north, go west, and put the chips on the stove. So far, they've done the first part: opened the door and moved east. Now, the next step according to the original plan was to make sure the screen door in the kitchen is open and then go east again. But the user's last action was opening the wooden door, which led them to the next room, probably the kitchen.

Wait, the user's current location is after opening the wooden door. The next step in the original plan was to "make absolutely sure that the screen door inside the kitchen is opened. And then, attempt to venture east." So they need to check the kitchen's screen door. But the user hasn't mentioned entering the kitchen yet. So the next action should be to check the screen door in the kitchen. But how? The user would need to look around to find it. So the next command should be to look at the screen door or open it if it's closed. But the original instruction says to "make sure it's opened," so maybe the user needs to open it if it's closed. However, the user's previous action was going east after opening the door, which might have led them into the kitchen. But the system message says the current location is the bedroom with the wooden door open. Wait, the user's last action was opening the wooden door, which was leading east. So after opening the door, they would go east into the next room, which is the kitchen. Then, they need to check the screen door there.

But the user's next step is to "make absolutely sure that the screen door inside the kitchen is opened." So the user needs to look for the screen door in the kitchen. So the next command should be to look at the screen door or open it. But the user's previous action was going east, which might have already moved them into the kitchen. However, the system message shows that the current location is the bedroom, so maybe the user hasn't moved yet. Wait, the user's last action was "open wooden door," which would allow them to go east. So the next step is to go east into the kitchen. Then, in the kitchen, they need to check the screen door. So the next command should be "go east" again. But the user might have already done that. Wait, the original plan says after opening the wooden door, they should attempt to go east. But the system message says that when they tried to go east, they had to open the door first. So after opening the door, they can go east. So the next step is to go east into the kitchen. Then, in the kitchen, they need to open the screen door. So the next command is "go east" to enter the kitchen. Then, in the kitchen, check the screen door. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action is to go east into the kitchen. Then, in the kitchen, open the screen door if it's closed. But the user's next action should be to go east again. However, the user is in the bedroom, after opening the door. So the next command is "go east" to enter the kitchen. Then, in the kitchen, check the screen door. So the next action is "go east".

You arrive in a kitchen. An usual kind of place.

You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a refrigerator. Hmmm... what else, what else? You smell an intriguing smell, and follow it to a counter. The counter is standard. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You see a stove. The stove is ordinary. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is ordinary. On the kitchen island you see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

You find yourself in a backyard. A typical one. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

You see a set of chairs. The set of chairs appears to be empty. You move on, clearly depressed by your TextWorld experience. You see a bbq. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a patio table. The patio table is normal. But the thing is empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the patio table.

There is an open screen door leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

Okay, the user is trying to play the TextWorld game and has followed the steps provided. Let me recap the current situation. They are in the Garden, and the task is to lift the half of a bag of chips from the floor. The user tried to type "lift half of a bag of chips from floor" but the system said that's not a recognized verb.

Hmm, in text adventures, commands are usually more straightforward. Instead of specifying the object and the action, you might just say "take half of a bag of chips" or "pick up half of a bag of chips". The error suggests that the game expects a different phrasing. Maybe the correct command is "take half of a bag of chips" instead of "lift". Let me check the previous commands. The user had to "take the old key from the chest drawer", so the structure was "take [object] from [location]". But in this case, the chips are on the floor, so maybe just "take half of a bag of chips" without specifying the floor. Alternatively, the game might accept "pick up" as the verb. But the user tried "lift", which wasn't recognized. So the correct command is likely "take half of a bag of chips". Let me confirm by looking at the game's possible commands. Since the user is in the Garden, and the chips are on the floor, the correct action is to take them. So the next command should be "take half of a bag of chips".
