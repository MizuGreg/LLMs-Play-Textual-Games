Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. Your first objective is to open the chest drawer within the bedroom. After that, recover the old key from the chest drawer. Then, unlock the wooden door within the bedroom. And then, assure that the wooden door is ajar. After opening the wooden door, attempt to move east. Then, make sure that the screen door inside the kitchen is ajar. After pulling open the screen door, take a trip east. Following that, make an effort to venture south. With that accomplished, pick up the milk from the floor of the garden. Then, head north. Next, try to go west. With that accomplished, rest the milk on the stove. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Bedroom =-
You arrive in a bedroom. A standard one.

Were you looking for a chest drawer? Because look over there, it's a chest drawer. You can see a closed antique trunk. Look over there! a king-size bed. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me see. The user has been following the steps to open the chest drawer, get the key, unlock the door, and now the wooden door is unlocked. The next step according to the original instructions was to make sure the door is ajar, which they've done. Then they need to move east.

So after unlocking the door, the next logical step is to go through the door. The user is in the bedroom, and the door leads east. So the next action should be "go east" to move into the next room, which is likely the kitchen. The user mentioned checking the screen door in the kitchen later, so moving east makes sense.

I need to make sure that the action is correctly phrased. The command should be "go east" without any extra words. The user's previous actions were all about interacting with the chest drawer and the door, so moving east is the next step in the sequence. The response should just be the command, nothing else.

Okay, the user is stuck because they keep trying to go east but the game says they have to open the wooden door first. Let me check the previous steps. The user opened the chest drawer, took the key, unlocked the door, but maybe didn't open it fully? Wait, the instruction said to "unlock the wooden door within the bedroom" and then "assure that the wooden door is ajar." So maybe unlocking isn't enough; they need to open it fully. The user might have only unlocked it but not opened it completely. So the next step should be to open the door fully, then go east. But the game's message is saying they have to open the door first, which suggests that the door is locked again. Wait, maybe after unlocking, they need to push or open it. Let me think. The user tried to go east before opening the door, which was incorrect. So the correct sequence is: unlock the door, then open it, then go east. But the game's feedback is saying they have to open the door first. Maybe the door is still closed after unlocking. So the user needs to open the door fully. So the next action should be to open the door. But the user already unlocked it. Hmm, maybe the game considers unlocking and opening as different actions. So after unlocking, they need to open it. So the next step is to open the door. Then go east. But the user's last action was go east, which was incorrect. So the correct next step is to open the door again. Wait, but the user already unlocked it. Maybe the door is locked again. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to push the door open. So the correct action is to open the door. Let me check the original instructions again. The user was told to "unlock the wooden door within the bedroom" and then "assure that the wooden door is ajar." So after unlocking, they need to make sure it's open. So the next action should be to open the door. Therefore, the next command should be "open wooden door" to make it ajar. Then go east. But the user tried to go east before that. So the correct next step is to open the door. But the game's message is saying they have to open the door first. So maybe the user hasn't opened it yet. Therefore, the next action is to open the door. So the answer should be "open wooden door".

You see a refrigerator. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a counter. The counter is usual. But there isn't a thing on it. You make out a stove. The stove is normal. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is normal. On the kitchen island you see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

Okay, the user is in the kitchen again and tried to type "go north" but the game said it's not a recognized verb. Let me check the previous steps. The user was in the bathroom, went south back to the kitchen. The kitchen has an open screen door east and an open wooden door west. The original goal was to head north after picking up the milk. But in the kitchen, the possible directions are east, west, or south. Wait, maybe the user is supposed to go east through the screen door. The original instructions said after moving east from the kitchen, venture south, pick up milk, head north, etc. Maybe the correct next step is to go east again. But the user was told to go north from the bathroom, but the kitchen doesn't have a north exit. So perhaps the user needs to go east through the screen door. Let me check the kitchen description again. The kitchen has an open screen door leading east. So the correct action is "go east" instead of "go north". The user might have confused the directions. So the next command should be "go east".

Okay, the user is in the bathroom again and needs to go south to exit. The previous steps have them moving back and forth between rooms. The original goal was to rest the milk on the stove. The user has the milk, so maybe they need to go back to the kitchen and put it on the stove. But the current location is the bathroom, so the next step is to go south to return to the kitchen. The correct command is "go south".
