I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is how to play! First, it would be great if you could ensure that the chest drawer within the bedroom is open. And then, retrieve the old key from the chest drawer. And then, unlock the wooden door with the old key. And then, ensure that the wooden door within the bedroom is open. And then, make an attempt to go east. And then, open the screen door. After opening the screen door, make an effort to go to the east. Then, take a trip south. And then, retrieve the bell pepper from the floor of the garden. If you can get your hands on the bell pepper, head north. Then, travel west. After that, rest the bell pepper on the stove. Got that? Good!

-= Bedroom =-
You're now in the bedroom. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You can make out a chest drawer. You can see a closed antique trunk. You make out a king-size bed. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Hm. Oh well

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

You can see a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this TextWorld game and has followed a set of instructions to reach certain points. So far, they've opened the chest drawer, retrieved the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, went east to the kitchen, opened the screen door, and now they're in the kitchen. The current score is 7 out of whatever the total is.

The user is asking if they're making the right actions and if they're close to the goal. The original goal mentioned earlier was to retrieve the bell pepper from the garden, rest it on the stove, and probably proceed further. But in the current kitchen, the next steps according to the initial instructions were to go east again after opening the screen door, then take a trip south, retrieve the bell pepper from the garden, head north, travel west, and rest the bell pepper on the stove.

Wait, but in the kitchen, the user just opened the screen door. The next step in the original plan was to go east again. However, in the kitchen description, there's a screen door leading east (which they just opened) and an open wooden door leading west. Also, there's an exit to the south. The user is at the kitchen now, after opening the screen door. The next action according to the initial plan was to go east again. But maybe they need to check if the screen door is open and then proceed east. However, the user just opened the screen door, so the next step would be to go east through it. But in the kitchen, the screen door is east, so going east would lead to another area. However, the initial instructions said after opening the screen door, make an effort to go to the east. So the next action should be "go east".

But the user is in the kitchen, and the screen door is east. So going east would be the next step. However, the user might need to check if that's the correct direction. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go south from the kitchen. But according to the original plan, after opening the screen door, they should go east. So the next action is "go east".

-= Backyard =-
If you're wondering why everything seems so ordinary all of a sudden, it's because you've just walked into the backyard. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You can see a set of chairs. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a set of chairs, go to TextWorld. The set of chairs is usual. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You see a bbq. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You swear loudly. You can see a patio table. Now why would someone leave that there? But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.

There is an open screen door leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a set of steps in the TextWorld game. They've successfully opened the chest drawer, retrieved the old key, unlocked the wooden door, and opened the screen door. They went east to the kitchen, then to the backyard, and now they're in the garden.

The original goal was to retrieve the bell pepper from the floor of the garden, then put it on the stove. But the user has been trying to take the bell pepper from the floor, but the game keeps saying it can't see any such thing. Wait, looking at the current scene in the garden, the user mentions that there's a half of a bag of chips, an apple, a bell pepper, and a shovel on the floor. So the bell pepper is actually there. But when the user tries to take it, the game says "You can't see any such thing." That's confusing. Maybe the command is incorrect. The correct command should be "take bell pepper from floor" but maybe the game expects "take bell pepper" without specifying the floor, since the bell pepper is on the floor. Alternatively, maybe the player needs to first look around to see the bell pepper. But according to the game's description, the user is in the garden and the items are on the floor. So the correct action should be "take bell pepper". Let me check the previous interactions. The user tried "take bell pepper from floor" multiple times, but the game didn't recognize it. Maybe the correct command is just "take bell pepper" because the bell pepper is on the floor, so the game automatically knows it's on the floor. Alternatively, maybe the game requires the player to first look at the bell pepper. But the user hasn't done that. However, in TextWorld, sometimes you need to use the correct syntax. Maybe the correct command is "take bell pepper" without specifying the floor. Let me try that. If the user says "take bell pepper", the game might recognize it. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use "get bell pepper" instead of "take". But the user has been using "take" so far. Hmm. The user's last action was trying to take the bell pepper from the floor, but the game says it's not there. But according to the game's description, the bell pepper is on the floor. So there's a discrepancy here. Maybe the game's description is outdated, or there's a typo. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to first look around to see the bell pepper. But the user hasn't done that. So the correct action would be to take the bell pepper. Let me try that.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a loop between the Kitchen and Bathroom, going back and forth. The original goal was to retrieve the bell pepper and put it on the stove, but they've been moving around instead.

Wait, in the Garden, they had the bell pepper. They took it and went north to the Backyard, then west to the Kitchen. But then they kept going north to the Bathroom and back. Maybe they forgot to put the bell pepper on the stove yet.

The current location is the Kitchen. The stove is mentioned here. So the next logical step is to put the bell pepper on the stove. But the user has the bell pepper in their inventory since they picked it up in the Garden. So the correct action now is to put it on the stove in the Kitchen. But the user hasn't done that yet. They might have gotten distracted by moving around. So the next command should be to put the bell pepper on the stove.

-= Kitchen =-
You've just sauntered into a kitchen.

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a refrigerator. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a counter. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. You make out a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. The stove is ordinary. The stove appears to be empty. You can see a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.
