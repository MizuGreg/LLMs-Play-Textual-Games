Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. Your first objective is to look and see that the antique trunk is open. After that, pick up the old key from the antique trunk in the bedroom. After that, insert the old key into the wooden door inside the bedroom's lock to unlock it. And then, ensure that the wooden door in the bedroom is open. After that, travel east. Okay, and then, doublecheck that the refrigerator is ajar. Then, take the milk from the refrigerator. Then, place the milk on the stove inside the kitchen. That's it!

-= Bedroom =-
You arrive in a bedroom. A standard kind of place.

You can make out a closed chest drawer. You can see an antique trunk. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a king-size bed. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me see. The user is in a text-based game where they need to follow a series of steps. So far, they've opened the antique trunk and found an old key. The next step according to the initial instructions was to pick up the key. But wait, the user just opened the trunk and the key was revealed. The next logical step would be to take the key from the trunk.

Wait, the user's last action was opening the trunk, and the game responded that the key was inside. Now, the user needs to pick up the key. But the prompt says to only output the action, like "go north". So the correct next command here would be to take the old key from the trunk. Let me check the previous steps again. The original plan was: open the trunk, pick up the key, then insert it into the door. So after opening the trunk and finding the key, the next step is to pick it up. The user hasn't done that yet. So the next action should be "take old key" or "pick up old key". But in the game's context, the exact command might be "take old key from antique trunk". However, the user's previous actions were "look at antique trunk" and "open antique trunk". The game's response after opening showed the key is there. So the next step is to take the key. The correct command here would be "take old key". But I need to make sure that's the right syntax. Since the user is in the bedroom, and the key is in the trunk, the command would be "take old key from antique trunk". But maybe the game expects just "take old key". Alternatively, maybe "pick up old key". But the user's previous actions were "look at antique trunk" and "open antique trunk", so perhaps the next step is to take the key. The user's last message was the game's response after opening the trunk, and the user is expected to input the next action. So the correct next command is "take old key".

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text adventure game. Their goal is to open the antique trunk, get the key, use it to unlock the door, open the door, go east, check the fridge, take milk, and put it on the stove.

So far, they've opened the trunk and taken the key. Then they tried to insert the key into the wooden door. But the system responded that it wasn't understood. Wait, maybe the correct action is to use the key on the door lock. The user might have misphrased it. The previous step was inserting the key into the door, but maybe the correct command is "use old key on wooden door" or "unlock wooden door with old key". 

Looking back at the environment description, the wooden door is in the bedroom. The user needs to unlock it. The system's response was that the action wasn't understood. So the user needs to try a different command. The next step after inserting the key should be to unlock the door. So the correct command might be "unlock wooden door" or "use old key on wooden door". 

The user's next action should be to try unlocking the door with the key. So the command would be "unlock wooden door" or "use old key on wooden door". Since the previous attempt was "insert old key into wooden door", which didn't work, the correct action is probably "unlock wooden door". 

So the next command should be "unlock wooden door".

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game where they have to follow a series of steps. The current scenario is in the bedroom. The previous actions were opening the antique trunk, taking the old key, inserting it into the wooden door, unlocking it, and now they've tried to open the door. But the system responded that the action wasn't understood.

So, the user's next step after opening the door would be to travel east, as per the original instructions. But since they're in the bedroom, after opening the door, they need to move east. However, the user might have confused the commands. The correct command after unlocking the door would be to open it, and then go east. But since the system didn't recognize "open wooden door," maybe the correct command is just "go east" once the door is open. Alternatively, maybe they need to check if the door is open before moving. But according to the original plan, after ensuring the door is open, they should travel east. So the next action should be "go east".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in a text-based game. Their goal is to open the antique trunk, get a key, use it to unlock a door, go east, check the fridge, get milk, and put it on the stove.

Currently, they've managed to open the trunk, take the key, unlock the door, but didn't open it yet. The game is reminding them that they need to open the wooden door first before going east. They tried "open wooden door in bedroom" again, but the system didn't recognize it. The correct command should just be "open wooden door" since the context is the bedroom. 

So the next step is to open the door. Once it's open, they can go east. Then they need to check the refrigerator. But since the user is stuck on the door, the immediate action is to open it. The previous attempt was correct, but maybe the system needs the command without the "in bedroom" part. So the correct command is "open wooden door".

You've entered a kitchen.

You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a refrigerator. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can make out a counter. The counter is normal. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You see a stove. The stove is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You can see a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Kitchen now. The original goal was to check the refrigerator, take milk, and put it on the stove. So far, they've opened the wooden door in the bedroom, inserted the key, unlocked and opened the door, then went east to the kitchen.

The current location is the Kitchen. The user needs to check if the refrigerator is ajar. The description says the refrigerator is closed. Wait, the user's next step is to double-check that the refrigerator is ajar. But in the kitchen description, it says "You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a refrigerator. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can make out a counter. The counter is normal. But the thing is empty, unfortunately." So the refrigerator is closed. But the original instruction said to "doublecheck that the refrigerator is ajar." So maybe the user needs to open it.

Wait, the user's next action after going east is to check the refrigerator. The user's previous action was going east, so now they need to check the refrigerator. The command would be "open refrigerator" or "look at refrigerator". But the user's instruction says "doublecheck that the refrigerator is ajar", so maybe the user needs to open it if it's closed. But according to the description, the refrigerator is closed. So the correct action is to open it. Then take the milk, then place it on the stove.

So the next command should be "open refrigerator".

Okay, let's see. The user has to follow a series of steps in the TextWorld game. So far, they've opened the antique trunk, taken the old key, unlocked and opened the bedroom door, went east to the kitchen, opened the refrigerator, took the milk. The next step was to place the milk on the stove inside the kitchen.

Wait, the user's last action was taking the milk from the refrigerator. The next step according to the original instructions is to place the milk on the stove. So the correct command here should be "put milk on stove". The user needs to do that next. Let me check if there's any confusion. The user might have missed that step, but based on the previous interactions, they've been following the commands correctly. So the next action is indeed placing the milk on the stove.
