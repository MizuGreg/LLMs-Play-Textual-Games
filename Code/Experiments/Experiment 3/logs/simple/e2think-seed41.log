Welcome to TextWorld! Here is how to play! First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to ensure that the antique trunk is open. After that, recover the old key from the antique trunk within the bedroom. After that, unlock the wooden door. After that, open the wooden door. And then, venture east. Okay, and then, ensure that the refrigerator is open. And then, retrieve the tomato plant from the refrigerator in the kitchen. If you have taken the tomato plant, place the tomato plant on the stove within the kitchen. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Bedroom =-
Look around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a bedroom.

You can make out a closed chest drawer right there by you. You can see a closed antique trunk nearby. Look over there! a king-size bed. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a king-size bed, go to TextWorld. The king-size bed is normal. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a TextWorld game. Their goal is to open the antique trunk, get the key, unlock the wooden door, open it, go east, then handle the refrigerator and tomato plant.

So far, they've opened the antique trunk and taken the old key. The current score is 2 out of 3. The next step according to the initial instructions was to unlock the wooden door. But wait, the wooden door is closed, right? The user has the key now. So they need to use the key to unlock the door. But the game might require them to first open the door, then go east. Wait, the original instructions said after unlocking the door, open it, then go east. So maybe the steps are: unlock the door, then open it, then go east. But in the game, the door might be locked, so using the key to unlock it. Then, once unlocked, open it. Then go east. Then proceed to the kitchen, open the fridge, get the tomato plant, put it on the stove. Then win.

So the next action should be to unlock the wooden door with the key. The user has the key, so they need to use it on the door. The command would be "unlock wooden door" or "use old key on wooden door". But in TextWorld, the correct command might be "unlock wooden door" since the key is already taken. Let me check the previous steps. The user took the key from the trunk, so now they need to unlock the door. The door is described as closed and leading east. So the next step is to unlock it. Therefore, the correct command is "unlock wooden door".

Okay, the user has successfully unlocked and opened the wooden door. The next step according to the original plan was to venture east. So now they need to go east. The command would be "go east". Let me make sure that's the next logical step. After opening the door, moving east makes sense to proceed to the next area, which is the kitchen as per the instructions. So the next action is "go east".

-= Kitchen =-
You've entered a kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

Oh, great. Here's a refrigerator. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. The counter is normal. But there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You see a stove. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The stove is standard. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You make out a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Okay, the user has opened the refrigerator and found a tomato plant and milk. The next step according to the original plan was to retrieve the tomato plant from the refrigerator. So they need to take the tomato plant. The command would be "take tomato plant from refrigerator". Let me check the previous steps.

Okay, the user tried to "place tomato plant on stove" but the game didn't recognize it. Maybe the correct command is "put tomato plant on stove". Let me check the possible commands. The stove is in the kitchen, and the user has the tomato plant. The correct verb might be "put" instead of "place". So the next action should be "put tomato plant on stove".
