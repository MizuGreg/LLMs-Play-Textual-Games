Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First, it would be great if you could make sure that the antique trunk is ajar. After that, recover the old key from the antique trunk. Then, make it so that the wooden door inside the bedroom is unlocked with the old key. Then, ensure that the wooden door inside the bedroom is open. Then, take a trip east. And then, ensure that the screen door is open. After that, attempt to travel east. Okay, and then, make an effort to head south. Then, pick up the half of a bag of chips from the floor of the garden. With the half of a bag of chips, attempt to go to the north. And then, try to travel west. Following that, sit the half of a bag of chips on the stove. That's it!

-= Bedroom =-
Well, here we are in a bedroom.

You see a closed chest drawer. You see an antique trunk. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a king-size bed. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps to open the antique trunk, take the key, and now they need to unlock the wooden door in the bedroom. The next step according to the original instructions was to make sure the wooden door is unlocked with the old key. So after taking the key, the next logical action would be to use it on the door.

Wait, the user just took the key, so the next command should be to unlock the door. The door is described as closed, so using the key on it should open it. Then, after unlocking, they need to open the door. So the steps are: unlock the door with the key, then open it. 

Looking at the previous actions, the user has already opened the trunk and taken the key. The next action should be to unlock the door. The command would be "unlock wooden door with old key". But in the game's context, maybe it's just "unlock wooden door" since the key is in hand. Alternatively, the game might require specifying the key. But based on the previous interactions, when they took the key, they didn't need to specify it again. So the next step is to unlock the door. Then open it. Then go east, etc.

So the next action is to unlock the wooden door. Then open it. So the next command is "unlock wooden door".

Okay, let's see. The user has successfully unlocked and opened the wooden door east. The next step in the original instructions was to take a trip east. So after opening the door, they should go east. The command would be "go east". Then, after that, they need to ensure the screen door is open and attempt to travel east again. But the current step is after opening the door, so the next action is to go east.

Wait, the user just opened the door, so the next command is "go east". Then, after that, the screen door might be part of the next area. But according to the original plan, after going east, they need to ensure the screen door is open. But the user's next action here is to go east from the bedroom. So the correct command is "go east".

You see a refrigerator. You can see a counter. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the counter. You can make out a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a kitchen island. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The kitchen island is standard. On the kitchen island you see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps correctly. They started in the bedroom, opened the trunk, took the key, unlocked and opened the eastern door, went east to the kitchen, then went north to the bathroom. The next step in the original instructions was to ensure the screen door is open. But in the kitchen, there's a closed screen door leading east. So the next action should be to open that screen door. The user needs to go back to the kitchen and open the screen door. But wait, the user is currently in the bathroom. So they need to go south back to the kitchen. Then open the screen door. But the current location is the bathroom, so the next command should be to go south back to the kitchen. Then open the screen door. But the user's next action should be to go south. Let me check the previous steps.

The user is in the bathroom, which is north of the kitchen. The kitchen has a screen door east. So the user needs to go south to the kitchen, then open the screen door. But the current location is the bathroom, so the next command is "go south" to return to the kitchen. Then open the screen door. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action is to go south.

Okay, the user tried to take the half of a bag of chips but couldn't. Then they went north, which brought them back to the backyard. The original goal was to pick up the half bag of chips from the garden and then go north with it. Maybe the user needs to try again to pick up the chips. But in the garden, the chips were on the floor. Wait, when the user was in the garden, the description said there is a half of a bag of chips on the floor. So maybe the correct command is "take half of a bag of chips from floor" again. But the user tried that and got a "can't see any such thing" response. Maybe the chips are not on the floor anymore? Or perhaps the user needs to check the garden again. Alternatively, maybe the user should go south from the backyard to the garden again. But the user is currently in the backyard. The original plan was to go north from the garden, pick up the chips, then go north again. But the user went north from the garden and ended up in the backyard. Maybe the correct next step is to go south back to the garden to pick up the chips again. But why couldn't they take it before? Maybe the command was incorrect. The correct command should be "take half of a bag of chips" without specifying the floor, or "pick up half of a bag of chips". Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check the garden again. But the user is in the backyard now. So the next action should be to go south to return to the garden and try taking the chips again. But the user's last action was "go north", which brought them back to the backyard. So the next step is to go south to the garden again. But the user might need to try taking the chips again. However, the system said "can't see any such thing" when they tried to take it. Maybe the chips are not there anymore, or the user needs to look elsewhere. Alternatively, maybe the user should try going north again from the backyard. But the original goal was to go north from the garden. So perhaps the user needs to go south from the backyard to the garden again and then take the chips. So the next command should be "go south" to return to the garden.

Okay, the user is in the garden again and tried to take the half of a bag of chips from the floor, but it didn't work. The previous attempt failed, so maybe the command is incorrect. Let me check the game's environment. The garden has a tomato plant, an apple, a half of a bag of chips, and a shovel on the floor. The user needs to pick up the half bag of chips. The correct command should be "take half of a bag of chips" without specifying the floor, or maybe "pick up half of a bag of chips". The system said "can't see any such thing" when the user tried "take half of a bag of chips from floor", so perhaps the chips are not on the floor anymore, or the command is wrong. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use a different verb. Let me think. In text adventures, sometimes you have to use "get" instead of "take". So maybe the correct command is "get half of a bag of chips". Alternatively, the user might need to check if the chips are actually there. But the description says they are on the floor. Maybe the user should try "take half of a bag of chips" without the "from floor" part. Let me try that.

Okay, the user tried to go north after picking up the chips, but the game said "That's not a verb I recognise." So the command "go north" is invalid here. Maybe the correct command is "move north" or "travel north". Alternatively, perhaps the user needs to use a different verb. Let me check the previous steps. The user is in the garden, and the instruction was to attempt to go north with the half bag of chips. The correct command should be "go north" but maybe the game expects "move north" or "travel north". Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use "north" as a direction without the verb. But in text adventures, "go north" is standard. Wait, the user just picked up the chips and needs to go north. The correct command is "go north". But the game said it's not recognized. Maybe the user should try "move north" instead. Let me try that.

You arrive in a backyard. A standard one.

You make out a set of chairs. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a bbq. The bbq is ordinary. However, the bbq, like an empty bbq, has nothing on it. Hm. Oh well You see a patio table. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is an open screen door leading west. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

You arrive in a backyard. A standard one.

You make out a set of chairs. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a bbq. The bbq is ordinary. However, the bbq, like an empty bbq, has nothing on it. Hm. Oh well You see a patio table. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is an open screen door leading west. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

-= Backyard =-
You arrive in a backyard. A standard one.

You make out a set of chairs. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a bbq. The bbq is ordinary. However, the bbq, like an empty bbq, has nothing on it. Hm. Oh well You see a patio table. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is an open screen door leading west. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

You arrive in a garden. A standard kind of place.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked.

There is a tomato plant, an apple and a shovel on the floor.
