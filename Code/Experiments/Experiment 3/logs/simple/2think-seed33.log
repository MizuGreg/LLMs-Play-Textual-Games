Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, you could, like, doublecheck that the antique trunk is open. And then, retrieve the old key from the antique trunk. After that, make sure that the wooden door in the bedroom is unlocked. Then, open the wooden door. After that, make an attempt to move east. And then, make it so that the refrigerator in the kitchen is ajar. And then, take the bell pepper from the refrigerator. Then, place the bell pepper on the stove. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Bedroom =-
Well, here we are in a bedroom.

You can see a closed chest drawer in the room. You see an antique trunk. You scan the room, seeing a king-size bed. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The king-size bed is standard. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps given. First, they opened the antique trunk and retrieved the old key. Now, the next step according to the original instructions was to make sure the wooden door in the bedroom is unlocked. So, the next action should be to unlock the door.

Wait, the user has already taken the key from the trunk. The next step in the task was to unlock the wooden door. So, the correct command here would be to unlock the door. But how do you do that in the game? The key might be needed to unlock it. Since the user has the key, they can use it to unlock the door. So the next action should be to unlock the wooden door. Let me check the previous steps again.

Yes, the user has the key now. The next step is to unlock the door. So the command should be "unlock wooden door". But in the game's context, maybe it's "unlock the wooden door" or "unlock door". The exact phrasing might matter. The user has to use the key to unlock it. So the correct action is to unlock the door with the key. Therefore, the next command is "unlock wooden door".

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps given. First, they checked the antique trunk, opened it, took the old key. Then they unlocked and opened the wooden door leading east. Now, the next step according to the original instructions was to "make an attempt to move east." So after opening the door, moving east should be the next action. The user is at the bedroom, having opened the door, so "go east" would be the command here. Let me make sure there's no other step in between. The original list after opening the door was to move east, then handle the refrigerator and bell pepper. So yes, next is moving east.

-= Kitchen =-
Well, here we are in a kitchen. Let's see what's in here.

You make out a refrigerator. You see a counter. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You can make out a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You make out a kitchen island. The kitchen island is typical. On the kitchen island you can make out a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

Okay, let's see. The user has to retrieve the bell pepper from the refrigerator and place it on the stove. So far, they've opened the refrigerator and found the bell pepper. The next step would be to take the bell pepper. Then, they need to go to the stove and put it there. But the current location is the kitchen, so maybe they need to go to the stove first. Wait, the user just opened the refrigerator, so the next action should be to take the bell pepper. Then, they need to go to the stove. But the stove is mentioned in the kitchen description. So after taking the bell pepper, they should go to the stove. But the user's last action was opening the refrigerator, so the next command should be "take bell pepper from refrigerator". Then, after that, "go to stove" or something similar. But the assistant needs to output only the next command. So the immediate next step is to take the bell pepper.

Okay, the user tried to "place bell pepper on stove" but the game said that's not a recognized verb. So I need to figure out the correct command. Let me think about possible actions in the kitchen. The user has the bell pepper and is in the kitchen. The stove is present. Maybe the correct action is "put bell pepper on stove" instead of "place". Or perhaps "put" is the correct verb here. Let me check the previous commands. The user had to "take bell pepper from refrigerator", so maybe "put" is the right verb. Alternatively, maybe "place" is allowed but the game didn't recognize it. Since the user is in the kitchen, and the stove is there, the correct action would be to put the bell pepper on the stove. So the next command should be "put bell pepper on stove".
