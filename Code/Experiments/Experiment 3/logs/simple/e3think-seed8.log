Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, doublecheck that the antique trunk in the bedroom is open. Then, pick up the old key from the antique trunk. Then, make it so that the wooden door within the bedroom is unlocked. Then, open the wooden door. After opening the wooden door, venture east. Then, open the screen door. Then, make an attempt to head east. That done, take a trip south. Then, pick up the milk from the floor of the garden. After getting the milk, try to head north. That done, attempt to take a trip west. Then, sit the milk on the stove in the kitchen. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Bedroom =-
You find yourself in a bedroom. An usual one. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You can see a chest drawer. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's an antique trunk. Were you looking for a king-size bed? Because look over there, it's a king-size bed. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps given. They started by opening the antique trunk, picking up the key, unlocking the wooden door, and then opening it. Now they're at the point where they need to go east through the door.

The next step in the original instructions was to venture east after opening the wooden door. So the user should now move east. But wait, the current location is the bedroom, and the wooden door was leading east. After opening it, they should go through that door. The next command would be "go east" or "open wooden door" again, but since the door is already open, it's probably "go east".

But looking at the previous steps, after unlocking the door, the user was told to "open the wooden door". The system message says that after unlocking, the door is now open. So the next action is to go east. Then, after that, they need to open the screen door, but that's part of the next steps. So the immediate next action is to go east through the opened door. The user's next command should be "go east".

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.

You make out a closed refrigerator in the corner. You make out a counter. The counter is normal. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a stove. The stove is ordinary. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can see a kitchen island. Now why would someone leave that there? On the kitchen island you see a note. You shudder, but continue examining the room.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Kitchen now. The original goal was to pick up the milk from the garden, but the user has been moving through the house. The current steps after entering the kitchen include opening the screen door east, then trying to go east. But the user's next action should be to open the screen door since it's closed. Wait, the kitchen has a closed screen door leading east. The user needs to open that before going through it. But the original instructions said after opening the wooden door (which was in the bedroom), venture east. But the user is now in the kitchen, and the screen door is east. So maybe the next step is to open the screen door. But the user's last action was "go east", which might not be possible if the door is closed. Wait, the current room is the kitchen, and the screen door is closed. So the user needs to open it first. But the user's last action was "go east", which might have been incorrect because the door is closed. Wait, the system message says that after opening the wooden door (from the bedroom), the user is in the kitchen. Then, the next step was to open the screen door. So the correct next action is to open the screen door. But the user's last action was "go east", which might have been a mistake. So the correct next step is to open the screen door. Then, after opening it, go east. But the user's next command should be "open screen door".

As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a patio table. But the thing is empty.

There is an open screen door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Backyard and Garden. They've been going back and forth between the two areas. The original goal was to pick up the milk from the garden and then head north. The user already picked up the milk, so the next step was to go north. But every time they try to go north from the garden, they end up in the backyard again. The problem might be that the north entrance from the garden is guarded, but the prompt says it's unguarded. Wait, the garden's description says "You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded." So maybe the user just needs to try going north again. But they keep getting redirected. Maybe the correct action is to go south again to reach the garden and then try north again. But the user has already done that. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to interact with the items in the garden, like the lettuce or shovel, but the original goal was just to pick up the milk. Since the milk was already picked up, the next step is to head north. The user might need to keep trying "go north" even though it's looping. The assistant's previous response was "go north", which led back to the backyard. But the user's next action should still be "go north" as per the instructions. So the answer is "go north".

The problem might be that the north entrance from the Garden is blocked or requires another action. However, the prompt says it's unguarded. Maybe the user needs to try a different approach, like interacting with the items in the Garden. But the original instructions didn't mention that. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west through the screen door in the Backyard. The Backyard has an open screen door leading west, which might lead back to the Bedroom or another area. But the user's goal is to reach the kitchen or another part. Wait, the user's original steps were to go east from the kitchen, then to the backyard, then to the garden. Maybe the correct path is to go west from the Backyard through the screen door back to the Kitchen. But the user's last action was going south to the Garden. Maybe the user needs to go west from the Backyard. The Backyard has an open screen door west, so the next action should be "go west". But the user has been going south and north instead. So the correct next action is "go west" to exit the Backyard and return to the Kitchen. That would make sense because the user was previously in the Kitchen, then went east to the Backyard, then south to the Garden. Now, going west from the Backyard would take them back to the Kitchen. Then, from the Kitchen, they can proceed further. So the next command should be "go west".

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.

You make out a closed refrigerator in the corner. You make out a counter. The counter is normal. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a stove. The stove is ordinary. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can see a kitchen island. Now why would someone leave that there? On the kitchen island you see a note. You shudder, but continue examining the room.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

-= Bathroom =-
You find yourself in a bathroom. An ordinary one.

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a toilet. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a bath. You make out a sink. You see a toothbrush on the sink. Now that's what I call TextWorld!

You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

<think>
Okay, the user is back in the Kitchen after going to the Bathroom and coming back. The original goal was to pick up the milk from the garden and then head north. The user has already completed that step. Now, they need to proceed further. The current room is the Kitchen, which has exits to north, east, west, and south. The user's next action should be to go north again, as per the original plan. But the user has been moving around, so maybe they need to check if there's anything else to do. However, the original instructions said to sit the milk on the stove in the kitchen after getting it. The user has the milk, so they need to place it on the stove. The command would be "put milk on stove". But the user's last action was "go south", which brought them back to the Kitchen. So the next step is to put the milk on the stove. Then, after that, maybe proceed further. But the original goal was to stop after that. So the correct next action is to put the milk on the stove.
