It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First stop, open the chest drawer. And then, pick up the old key from the chest drawer within the bedroom. After picking up the old key, make it so that the wooden door is unlocked. After that, ensure that the wooden door within the bedroom is open. After that, move east. With that done, open the screen door. And then, go east. Following that, try to move south. Okay, and then, recover the apple from the floor of the garden. If you can get your hands on the apple, head north. That done, try to head west. And then, put the apple on the stove in the kitchen. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Bedroom =-
You find yourself in a bedroom. A typical kind of place. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You see a chest drawer. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can make out a closed antique trunk here. You see a king-size bed. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You swear loudly.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

-= Kitchen =-
You've just sauntered into a kitchen.

You make out a closed refrigerator. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. But there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the counter. You see a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a kitchen island! The kitchen island is normal. On the kitchen island you can see a note. Huh, weird.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game and has followed a series of steps to progress. They've opened the chest drawer, picked up the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, then went east into the kitchen. Now they're at the kitchen, where there's a screen door leading east that they need to open before they can go through it.

The user's current location is the kitchen, and the next step they need to do is open the screen door. The previous attempt to go east didn't work because the screen door was closed. So the correct action here is to open the screen door first. The user's score is at 5/7, so they need to continue following the steps correctly to reach the goal.

The original goal was to recover the apple from the garden, put it on the stove in the kitchen, and then head north. So far, they've done the necessary steps in the bedroom and kitchen. Now, after opening the screen door, they can proceed east again. Then, after moving south, they need to go to the garden, recover the apple, and so on.

The user is asking if they're making the right actions and if they're close to the goal. Based on the steps taken so far, they are on the right track. The next immediate action is to open the screen door. Once that's done, they can go east again. Then, moving south would take them to the garden where the apple is. After that, they can return to the kitchen, put the apple on the stove, and finally head north to win.

So the next command should be to open the screen door. That's the logical next step after being in the kitchen and needing to go east. The user has to make sure they follow each step carefully, as some doors need to be opened before they can be passed through.

You've entered a backyard.

You see a set of chairs. The set of chairs is ordinary. But there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You make out a bbq. However, the bbq, like an empty bbq, has nothing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a patio table! The patio table is usual. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

There is an open screen door leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the steps to complete the game. They've picked up the apple in the garden and tried to go north back to the backyard. Now, they need to put the apple on the stove in the kitchen. But when they tried to do that, they couldn't see the stove.

Wait, the current location is the backyard. The stove is in the kitchen. So the user needs to go back to the kitchen. Let me check the previous steps. They were in the garden, then went north to the backyard. Now, they need to find the way back to the kitchen. The kitchen was earlier in the path. Maybe they need to go west through the screen door in the backyard to get back to the kitchen. Once in the kitchen, they can then put the apple on the stove. So the next action should be to go west through the screen door. Then, once in the kitchen, they can put the apple on the stove. That makes sense. So the correct command here is to go west.
