Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! First of all, ensure that the antique trunk is open. And then, recover the old key from the antique trunk. With the old key, unlock the wooden door. And then, ensure that the wooden door is open. Then, make an effort to go to the east. After that, ensure that the screen door inside the kitchen is open. After pulling open the screen door, take a trip east. Next, attempt to venture south. After that, pick up the apple from the floor of the garden. After that, travel north. With that accomplished, go west. And then, sit the apple on the stove within the kitchen. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Bedroom =-
You arrive in a bedroom. A typical one. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You can make out a closed chest drawer, which looks usual, in the corner. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see an antique trunk. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a king-size bed. The king-size bed is standard. But there isn't a thing on it.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this TextWorld game and has followed a series of steps to progress. They've opened the antique trunk, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door, gone east to the kitchen, opened the screen door, went east again to the backyard. Now they're in the backyard, and the next steps according to the initial instructions were to venture south from the kitchen, pick up the apple in the garden, travel north, go west, and then put the apple on the stove in the kitchen to win.

Wait, the current location is the backyard. The user just came from the kitchen via the screen door. The next step in the original plan was to go south from the kitchen. But in the current state, they're in the backyard. So maybe they need to go south from here. Let me check the current room description. The backyard has an open screen door leading west back to the kitchen, and the south entrance is unblocked. So the user should try going south from the backyard to reach the garden where the apple is. Then pick up the apple, go north to the kitchen, west to the stove, and place the apple there. The user's next action should be to go south from the backyard. But the user's last action was going east to the backyard, so now they need to go south. But the user's last input was "go east" which led them to the backyard. Now, the next step is to go south from the backyard. However, the user's current location is the backyard, and the south is unblocked. So the correct next command is "go south".

Okay, the user is trying to pick up the apple in the garden, but every time they try, the system responds that it only understood them as wanting to pick up the apple. The user has been trying "take apple from floor" and "pick up apple from floor" multiple times, but it's not working. The problem might be that the correct command is just "take apple" or "pick up apple" without specifying "from floor" since the apple is on the floor by default. Let me check the previous interactions.

In the garden description, it says there's an apple on the floor. So maybe the correct command is simply "take apple" or "pick up apple". The system's responses indicate that it's not recognizing "from floor" as necessary. The user's previous attempts included "take apple from floor" and "pick up apple from floor", but the system is not accepting those. The user might need to try a simpler command. Let me try "take apple" next. If that doesn't work, maybe "pick up apple". The user's next action should be to try the simplest form of the command without specifying the floor, since the apple is already on the floor. So the next command should be "take apple".
