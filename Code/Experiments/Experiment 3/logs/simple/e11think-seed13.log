I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is how to play! First, it would be great if you could ensure that the chest drawer within the bedroom is open. And then, retrieve the old key from the chest drawer. And then, unlock the wooden door with the old key. And then, ensure that the wooden door within the bedroom is open. And then, make an attempt to go east. And then, open the screen door. After opening the screen door, make an effort to go to the east. Then, take a trip south. And then, retrieve the bell pepper from the floor of the garden. If you can get your hands on the bell pepper, head north. Then, travel west. After that, rest the bell pepper on the stove. Got that? Good!

-= Bedroom =-
You're now in the bedroom. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You can make out a chest drawer. You can see a closed antique trunk. You make out a king-size bed. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Hm. Oh well

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

-= Kitchen =-
You've just sauntered into a kitchen.

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a refrigerator. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a counter. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. You make out a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. The stove is ordinary. The stove appears to be empty. You can see a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

If you're wondering why everything seems so ordinary all of a sudden, it's because you've just walked into the backyard. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You can see a set of chairs. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a set of chairs, go to TextWorld. The set of chairs is usual. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You see a bbq. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You swear loudly. You can see a patio table. Now why would someone leave that there? But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.

There is an open screen door leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, the user is playing a text adventure game and has reached the Garden area. Their goal is to retrieve the bell pepper, put it on the stove, and then proceed to the next steps. Let me check the current state.

In the Garden, the user sees a half-bag of chips, an apple, a bell pepper, and a shovel on the floor. The user needs to retrieve the bell pepper. The previous attempt to "retrieve bell pepper from floor" was incorrect because "retrieve" isn't a valid verb here. The correct action should be "take" or "pick up".

So the next step is to take the bell pepper. Once that's done, they need to go north, then west, and place the bell pepper on the stove. The user is currently at 8/9, so after taking the bell pepper, they should go north. Then, after reaching the next area, they can rest the bell pepper on the stove. The user needs to make sure they follow the correct sequence of actions as per the initial instructions.
