I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, open the antique trunk. And then, retrieve the old key from the antique trunk. With the old key, unlock the wooden door inside the bedroom with the old key. Then, ensure that the wooden door is open. And then, head east. After that, ensure that the screen door is open. And then, head east. And then, try to move south. And then, pick-up the bell pepper from the floor of the garden. With the bell pepper, attempt to head north. With that accomplished, go to the west. And then, place the bell pepper on the stove. Alright, thanks!

-= Bedroom =-
Ah, the bedroom. This is some kind of bedroom, really great normal vibes in this place, a wonderful normal atmosphere. You can barely contain your excitement.

You can make out a closed chest drawer in the room. You can see a closed antique trunk nearby. You make out a king-size bed. The king-size bed is normal. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me see. The user is playing a text-based game and has followed a series of steps. So far, they've opened an antique trunk, retrieved an old key, unlocked a wooden door, and the score has increased each time. The current task is to ensure the wooden door is open, then head east, open a screen door, head east again, move south, pick up a bell pepper, use it to head north, go west, and place the bell pepper on the stove.

The user is now asking if they're on the right track and if they're close to the goal. The assistant needs to confirm that the actions so far are correct and then proceed with the next step. The next action after unlocking the door is to ensure the door is open, which they've already done. Then they need to head east. The user's last action was unlocking the door, so the next step should be moving east. The assistant should respond with "go east" as the next command.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in the game. They tried to unlock the wooden door but it's already unlocked. Wait, the previous steps were: open the antique trunk, retrieve the key, unlock the door. Then they went east, but the game says they need to open the door first. But the door was already unlocked. Maybe there's a mistake here.

Wait, the user tried to unlock the door again, but the game says it's already unlocked. So maybe the door is open, but the user isn't allowed to go through until it's open. But the user tried to go east before opening it. The game is probably checking if the door is open. But the user already unlocked it, so maybe the door is open. But the game is saying they need to open it first. Maybe there's a confusion between unlocking and opening. Maybe the door is locked, but the user already unlocked it, so it's open. But the game is not recognizing that. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to open the door by another action. Wait, the initial task was to unlock the wooden door with the key. Once unlocked, the door should be open. So the user should be able to go east. But the game is preventing that. Maybe the user needs to check the door's state again. But the user can't check, so maybe the next step is to try going east again, even though the game says to open the door first. But the user already did unlock it. Maybe the game has a bug, but the user has to proceed. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to open the door again. But that doesn't make sense. The user should be able to go east now. So the next action is to go east again, even though the game is saying to open the door first. But the user has already done that. Maybe the user needs to proceed despite the message. So the next action is go east.

<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game called TextWorld. Their task is to follow a series of steps to complete a goal. So far, they've opened an antique trunk, retrieved an old key, unlocked a wooden door, and tried to go east. But the game is saying they need to open the wooden door first, even though they just unlocked it.

Wait, maybe there's a misunderstanding. The user tried to unlock the door with the key, but the game says it's already unlocked. However, the door might still be closed. The user might be confusing "unlocked" with "open." In some games, you have to both unlock and open a door. So even if the door is unlocked, it might still be closed and need to be opened.

Looking back at the initial instructions: the user was told to "unlock the wooden door inside the bedroom with the old key. Then, ensure that the wooden door is open." So maybe after unlocking, they need to open it. The user tried to unlock it, but the game might be expecting them to open it after unlocking. But the user's last action was trying to go east, which is blocked because the door isn't open yet.

So the next step should be to open the door after unlocking it. But the user tried to go east again, which is why the game is prompting them to open the door first. The user might be stuck in a loop where they keep trying to go east without opening the door. The correct action would be to open the door after unlocking it. However, the game's response says "That's unlocked at the moment," which might mean the door is unlocked but still closed. Therefore, the user needs to open it, not just unlock it.

But the user's previous action was "unlock the wooden door with the old key," which the game acknowledged as successful. Then, the user tried to go east, but the game says they need to open the door first. So maybe the door is unlocked but not open, and the user needs to open it. However, the game's message says "You have to open the wooden door first," which is confusing because the door was just unlocked. This suggests that the user might need to open the door after unlocking it. But the game's response might be incorrect, or maybe there's a step missing.

Alternatively, maybe the door is locked and needs to be unlocked, but the user already did that. The user's next step should be to open the door. However, the game's messages are conflicting. The user is getting stuck in a loop where they keep trying to go east without opening the door. The correct action would be to open the door after unlocking it. But the game's messages are not clear, so the user might need to try opening the door again.

There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following a series of steps in the TextWorld game. Their goal is to open the antique trunk, get the old key, unlock the wooden door, move east, open the screen door, and then proceed further. So far, they've managed to open the trunk, retrieve the key, unlock the door, and move east into the kitchen. They opened the screen door next, which was required to go east.

Now, the user is in the Kitchen, and the next step according to the original task was to "head east" after opening the screen door. But the screen door is now open, so they can go east. However, the game's response says that after opening the screen door, the next action is to go east. But the user tried to go east again, and the game responded with "You have to open the screen door first." Wait, no, the user just opened the screen door, so maybe the next step is to go east from the kitchen. But the current location is the Kitchen, and the screen door is leading east. So after opening the screen door, the user can go east into the next room. The game's message says that the screen door is now open, so the next action should be to go east. The user's next input was "go east", which is correct. The game's response was "You have to open the screen door first." That seems contradictory because the user just opened the screen door. Maybe there's a mistake in the game's response, but the user should proceed to go east. The next step after opening the screen door is to go east into the next room. So the correct action is "go east".

Look over there! a toilet. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You make out a bath. You see a sink. The sink is normal. On the sink you can see a toothbrush.

There is an unguarded exit to the south.

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. It seems to be pretty usual here.

Were you looking for a refrigerator? Because look over there, it's a refrigerator. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. The counter appears to be empty. You scan the room, seeing a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is typical. On the kitchen island you make out a note. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in a text adventure game. Their goal was to follow a series of steps: open the antique trunk, get the old key, unlock the bedroom door, go east, open the screen door, go east again, then move south, pick up the bell pepper, use it to go north, then west, and place the bell pepper on the stove.

So far, they've done most of these steps. They opened the trunk, took the key, unlocked the door, went east to the kitchen, opened the screen door, went east to the backyard, then south to the garden where they picked up the bell pepper. Then they went north back to the backyard, then west to the kitchen, then north again to the bathroom, and then south back to the kitchen.

Now, the current location is the kitchen again. The next step in the original goal was to place the bell pepper on the stove. The user has the bell pepper in their inventory since they picked it up in the garden. The stove is in the kitchen, so the next logical step is to go to the stove and place the bell pepper there.

But the user is currently in the kitchen. The stove is mentioned in the kitchen description. So the next action should be to go to the stove. However, the command needs to be in the correct format. The user has the bell pepper, so they need to put it on the stove. The correct command would be "put the bell pepper on the stove".

But the system might require the user to first go to the stove's location. Wait, in the kitchen description, the stove is mentioned as "you can see a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it." So the stove is present. Therefore, the user can directly attempt to put the bell pepper on the stove.

So the next action should be "put the bell pepper on the stove".
