I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First off, ensure that the antique trunk within the bedroom is open. After that, recover the old key from the antique trunk. After that, make it so that the wooden door in the bedroom is unlocked with the old key. And then, make absolutely sure that the wooden door inside the bedroom is ajar. After opening the wooden door, go east. Then, doublecheck that the screen door is wide open. And then, attempt to travel east. And then, try to travel south. With that done, lift the milk from the floor of the garden. After stealing the milk, head north. And then, attempt to travel west. With that done, rest the milk on the stove. That's it!

-= Bedroom =-
I am sorry to announce that you are now in the bedroom. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a chest drawer. You scan the room for an antique trunk, and you find an antique trunk. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to a king-size bed. The king-size bed is standard. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. You think about smashing the king-size bed to bits, throwing the bits in the dump, etc, until you get bored.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Of every kitchen you could have sauntered into, you had to walk into an ordinary one. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You can see a closed refrigerator in the room. You can make out a counter. The counter is usual. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. You scan the room, seeing a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. You can see a kitchen island. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? On the kitchen island you can see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what the next step should be. The user has been following a series of tasks in the TextWorld game. So far, they've opened the antique trunk, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door, opened it, and then went east into the kitchen. The current location is the kitchen, and the user is asked to decide the next action.

Looking back at the original task list, after opening the wooden door and going east to the kitchen, the next steps mentioned were: double-check that the screen door is wide open, then travel east, then try to travel south. Then, in the garden, lift the milk, head north, go west, and rest the milk on the stove.

In the kitchen, the user now sees a closed refrigerator, a counter, a stove, a kitchen island with a note, a closed screen door east, an open wooden door west, and exits north and south. The next task after entering the kitchen was to double-check the screen door is open. But in the current state, the screen door is closed. So the user needs to open it.

Wait, the user's last action was going east into the kitchen. The prompt says to double-check the screen door is wide open. So the next action should be to open the screen door. But the user might not have done that yet. Let me check the previous steps again.

The original instructions said: After opening the wooden door, go east. Then, doublecheck that the screen door is wide open. So after going east into the kitchen, the screen door (leading east) is closed. So the user needs to open it. Then, after that, travel east again. But in the current state, the screen door is closed. So the next action should be to open the screen door.

But the user is in the kitchen now. The screen door is leading east. So the command would be "open screen door" or "open door east". However, in the game's context, the screen door is described as closed. So the correct action here is to open it. Then, after that, the user can go east again.

So the next command should be "open screen door".

The bbq is usual. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm. Oh well You can see a patio table. However, the patio table, like an empty patio table, has nothing on it.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in the TextWorld game. They've successfully opened the antique trunk, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door, opened it, and moved east to the kitchen. Then they opened the screen door, went east to the backyard, and then south to the garden. In the garden, they tried to take the milk from the floor but kept getting the message "You can't see any such thing."

Wait, the garden description says: "There is a milk, a half of a bag of chips, a lettuce and a shovel on the floor." So the milk is actually there. But when the user tried to take it, it didn't work. Maybe the correct command is "take milk" without "from floor" since the milk is on the floor, but the game might require specifying the location. Alternatively, maybe the milk is not visible, even though it's there. Or perhaps the game expects a different verb, like "pick up" instead of "take."

But the user has been using "take [object] from [location]" format. However, in the garden, the milk is on the floor, so maybe the correct command is just "take milk" without specifying the floor. Let me check the previous steps. In the kitchen, the user took the milk from the floor, but that was in the garden. Wait, no, in the garden, the milk is on the floor. So the correct command should be "take milk" because the milk is on the floor, and the game might automatically recognize that. But the user kept getting "You can't see any such thing." Maybe the milk is not actually there, but the description says it is. Alternatively, maybe the game requires the user to first check the floor or use a different command.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use "pick up milk" instead of "take milk." But the game's previous actions used "take" for the key. Let me think. The user tried "take milk from floor" but got an error. Maybe the correct command is just "take milk" because the milk is on the floor, and the game expects that. Or perhaps the milk is not visible, so the user needs to look around again. But the description says the milk is there. Maybe the game has a bug, but the user needs to try different commands.

Alternatively, maybe the user should try "get milk" instead of "take milk." But the game's previous actions used "take." Hmm. The user has to figure out the correct command. Since the milk is on the floor, perhaps the correct command is "take milk" without the "from floor" part. Let me try that. The user tried "take milk from floor" and it didn't work. Maybe the correct command is just "take milk." Let me check the game's possible commands. In TextWorld, usually, you can take an object from a location by specifying the location, but sometimes it's just "take [object]." Alternatively, maybe the milk is not in the inventory yet, so the user needs to try again. But the user tried multiple times and got the same error. Maybe the game expects a different action, like "pick up milk." But the user's previous action was "take milk from floor," which didn't work. Maybe the correct command is "take milk" without the "from floor." Let me try that. The user should try "take milk" next.

-= Bathroom =-
You arrive in a bathroom. A typical kind of place.

You see a closed ordinary looking toilet in the room. You see a bath. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? Hey, want to see a sink? Look over there, a sink. The sink is ordinary. On the sink you can make out a toothbrush.

There is an unblocked exit to the south.

go south
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Kitchen =-
Of every kitchen you could have sauntered into, you had to walk into an ordinary one. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You can see a closed refrigerator in the room. You can make out a counter. The counter is usual. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. You scan the room, seeing a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. You can see a kitchen island. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? However, the kitchen island, like an empty kitchen island, has nothing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the kitchen island.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they have to follow a series of steps to complete a task. The current goal is to rest the milk on the stove. So far, they've collected the milk from the garden, moved through various rooms, and are now in the kitchen. The kitchen island was supposed to have a note, but now it's mentioned that the kitchen island has nothing on it. The user has the milk and needs to put it on the stove.

Looking at the current room description, the kitchen has a stove, but there's no mention of the milk being on the stove. The user has the milk in their inventory, so the next logical step is to place it on the stove. The command should be "put milk on stove" or something similar. However, the game's response when they tried "put milk on stove" might have been incorrect, but based on the previous steps, that's the correct action. The user needs to rest the milk on the stove as per the original task. So the next action should be to put the milk on the stove.
