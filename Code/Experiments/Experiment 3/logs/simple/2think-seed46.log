Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First, it would be great if you could make sure that the antique trunk is opened. After that, pick up the old key from the antique trunk inside the bedroom. After picking up the old key, assure that the wooden door in the bedroom is unlocked. After unlocking the wooden door, doublecheck that the wooden door is wide open. Then, try to go to the east. With that accomplished, ensure that the refrigerator within the kitchen is open. And then, retrieve the milk from the refrigerator inside the kitchen. And then, rest the milk on the stove. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Bedroom =-
You are in a bedroom. A normal kind of place.

What's that over there? It looks like it's a chest drawer. You can see a closed antique trunk. You scan the room for a king-size bed, and you find a king-size bed. The king-size bed is standard. But the thing is empty.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me see. The user has already opened the antique trunk and picked up the old key. The next step according to the instructions was to unlock the wooden door in the bedroom. So after picking up the key, the next logical step is to use the key to unlock the door. The user mentioned that after unlocking, they need to check if the door is wide open and then go east. So the next action should be to unlock the door with the key. The current location is the bedroom, and the door is leading east. So the command should be to unlock the wooden door. Let me make sure that's the correct next step. Yes, that's right. The user has the key, so they can unlock the door now.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps to open the antique trunk, pick up the key, unlock the wooden door, and open it. Now they're at the bedroom door, which is open. The next step according to the original instructions was to try to go east. So after opening the door, the next logical step would be to move east. But wait, the user just opened the door, so maybe they need to check if they can go through it. But the command should be "go east" once they're outside the bedroom. Let me make sure. The previous action was opening the wooden door, so now they should be able to go east. The next step in the plan is to go east, then check the kitchen. So the next command should be "go east".

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. A typical kind of place.

What's that over there? It looks like it's a refrigerator. You see a counter. The counter is typical. But the thing is empty. Sometimes, just sometimes, TextWorld can just be the worst. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You see a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island. Now that's what I call TextWorld!

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an unguarded exit to the north. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

Okay, let me figure out the next step here. The user has already opened the refrigerator and found milk and lettuce. The original goal was to retrieve the milk from the refrigerator and then rest it on the stove. So after opening the fridge, the next logical step is to pick up the milk. The user hasn't done that yet. The current location is the kitchen, so the command should be to take the milk. Let me check the previous actions to make sure I'm not missing anything. The user picked up the old key, unlocked and opened the door, went east to the kitchen, opened the fridge. Now, the milk is inside, so "take milk" makes sense. Then, after getting the milk, they need to go to the stove and put it there. But the next step right now is to pick up the milk. So the correct command here is "take milk".

Okay, the user tried to "rest milk on stove" but the game didn't recognize it. So I need to figure out the correct command. Let me check the possible actions in the kitchen. The user has the milk, and the stove is present. The correct action might be "put milk on stove" or "put milk on the stove". Since "rest" isn't a valid verb here, the right command is likely "put". So the next step is to use "put milk on stove" or similar. But the game might expect "put" as the verb. Let me confirm. The user has the milk, so the correct action is to put it on the stove. The previous command was "rest", which is invalid. So the correct command should be "put milk on stove".
