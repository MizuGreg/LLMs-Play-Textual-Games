Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First, it would be good if you could open the chest drawer within the bedroom. And then, take the old key from the chest drawer within the bedroom. With the old key, unlock the wooden door. Then, ensure that the wooden door within the bedroom is open. After that, make an effort to head east. If you can accomplish that, open the refrigerator inside the kitchen. After that, recover the lettuce from the refrigerator in the kitchen. After that, rest the lettuce on the stove. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Bedroom =-
You're now in the bedroom. Let's see what's in here.

You can make out a closed chest drawer. You see an antique trunk. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You make out a king-size bed. The king-size bed is normal. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user has already opened the chest drawer and taken the old key. The next step was to unlock the wooden door with the key. So the next action should be to unlock the door. But wait, in TextWorld, sometimes you need to use the key on the door. So maybe the command is "unlock wooden door with old key". But the user might have to specify the key. Let me check the previous steps. The user took the old key from the chest drawer. So now, they need to use that key to unlock the door. The door is closed and leads east. So the correct command would be to unlock the door with the key. But the system might require a specific phrasing. Let me think. The previous actions were "open chest drawer" and "take old key from chest drawer". Now, the next step is to unlock the door. So the next command should be "unlock wooden door with old key". But maybe the game expects "use old key on wooden door" or something similar. However, the user's previous actions used "take" and "open", so maybe "unlock" is the right verb here. Let me confirm. The task said to "unlock the wooden door" using the old key. So the correct command is "unlock wooden door with old key". But the system might require just "unlock wooden door" if the key is in the inventory. Alternatively, maybe "use old key on wooden door". But the user has the key, so the correct action is to unlock the door with the key. So the next command should be "unlock wooden door with old key".

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this TextWorld game. They've been trying to follow the steps to open the chest drawer, take the old key, unlock the door, and then go east to the kitchen. So far, they've managed to open the chest drawer, take the key, unlock the door, but when they tried to go east, the game said they need to open the wooden door first.

Wait, the door was already unlocked. Oh, but maybe the door is still closed? Let me check the previous steps. The user unlocked the wooden door, but maybe they didn't open it yet. The game message says "You unlock wooden door," but perhaps the action is just unlocking it, not opening it. So the door might still be locked but unlocked, meaning it's ready to be opened. But the user tried to go east, and the game said they have to open the door first. So maybe the door is locked, but they only unlocked it. Hmm, maybe there's a confusion between unlocking and opening. So the next step should be to open the door. Let me think: after unlocking, the door is unlocked but not open. So the user needs to open it. So the correct action here is to open the wooden door. Then, after that, they can go east to the kitchen. So the next command should be "open wooden door".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the steps in the TextWorld game. They've already opened the chest drawer, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door, opened it, and tried to go to the kitchen. But when they tried "go to kitchen", it didn't work. So now they need to figure out the correct next step.

First, the original task was to first open the chest drawer in the bedroom, take the key, unlock the door, make sure the door is open, then go east. Then open the fridge in the kitchen, get the lettuce, put it on the stove. So after opening the door and going east, they should be in the kitchen. But the user tried "go to kitchen" which didn't work. Maybe the correct command is "go east" again, since the door was leading east. Wait, the user already went east after opening the door. Maybe they need to check if they're in the kitchen now. But the system message says they can't see the kitchen. Maybe the next step is to look around for the refrigerator. Alternatively, maybe they need to use the correct command to move to the kitchen. But the user tried "go to kitchen" and it didn't work. Maybe the correct command is "go east" again, but that's already been done. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "open the refrigerator" once they're in the kitchen. But how to get there?

Wait, the user is in the bedroom after opening the door. The door was leading east, so when they opened it, they should have moved to the kitchen. But the system message says "You can't see any such thing." So maybe the user is still in the bedroom, and the door is not properly opened. Wait, but the user just opened the door. Maybe the correct command is to "go east" again. Let me check the previous steps. The user tried "go east" after opening the door, but the system said "You have to open the wooden door first." Wait, no, the user had already opened the door. Wait, the user's previous action was "open wooden door", then the system said "You open wooden door." Then the user tried "go to kitchen" which didn't work. So maybe the user is still in the bedroom, and the kitchen is not accessible yet. Maybe the user needs to check the bedroom's description again. The bedroom's description says there's a closed wooden door leading east. After opening it, the user should be in the kitchen. But perhaps the game requires the user to "go east" again. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "open the refrigerator" once in the kitchen. But how to get there?

Alternatively, maybe the user is in the bedroom, and the kitchen is not directly accessible. Maybe the user needs to look for a way to get to the kitchen. The original task said after unlocking the door, ensure the door is open, then head east. So after opening the door, the user should be in the kitchen. But the system message says "You can't see any such thing." So maybe the user is still in the bedroom, and the kitchen is not visible. Maybe the correct command is "go east" again. Let me check the previous steps again. The user tried "go east" after opening the door, but the system said "You have to open the wooden door first." Wait, that's conflicting. Wait, the user's previous action was "open wooden door", which was successful. Then the user tried "go to kitchen", which didn't work. So maybe the user is in the bedroom, and the kitchen is not accessible yet. Maybe the user needs to check the bedroom's description again. The bedroom has a closed wooden door leading east. After opening it, the user should be in the kitchen. But perhaps the game requires the user to "go east" again. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "look around" to find the kitchen. But the user can't use that command. The user's next action should be "go east" again, since the door was leading east. So the correct command is "go east".

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. An usual one.

A closed refrigerator is here. You scan the room for a counter, and you find a counter. The counter is ordinary. But the thing is empty. You move on, clearly infuriated by your TextWorld experience. You see a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You see a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island, so there's that.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Okay, let's see. The user has to follow a series of steps to complete the game. So far, they've opened the chest drawer, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door, opened it, went to the kitchen, and opened the refrigerator. They found a lettuce and half a bag of chips.

The next step according to the original task was to take the lettuce from the refrigerator. The user just opened the fridge, so the next logical action is to take the lettuce. Then, they need to rest the lettuce on the stove. But first, they have to pick up the lettuce. So the immediate next command should be "take lettuce from refrigerator". 

Wait, the game's current location is the kitchen, and the refrigerator is open. The user has to take the lettuce. After that, they need to go to the stove, which is in the kitchen, and put the lettuce there. So the next step is definitely taking the lettuce. The user hasn't done that yet. So the correct command here is "take lettuce from refrigerator".

Okay, the user tried to "rest lettuce on stove" but the game said that's not a recognized verb. So I need to figure out the correct action here. Let me think about the possible commands in the game.

The task was to rest the lettuce on the stove. The user has the lettuce in hand. The correct action might be to put the lettuce on the stove. The game might use "put" as the verb. So instead of "rest", the correct command is "put lettuce on stove". Let me check if that's the right syntax. The game's previous actions used "take" and "open", so "put" is likely the right verb here. Therefore, the next action should be "put lettuce on stove".
