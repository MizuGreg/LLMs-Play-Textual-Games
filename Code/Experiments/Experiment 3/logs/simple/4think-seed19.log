Welcome to another life changing episode of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, you could, like, doublecheck that the chest drawer is opened. Once you have opened the chest drawer, recover the old key from the chest drawer within the bedroom. And then, unlock the wooden door. Then, open the wooden door. Once you have opened the wooden door, attempt to go to the east. With that accomplished, make absolutely sure that the refrigerator within the kitchen is ajar. Then, pick up the milk from the refrigerator. After taking the milk, sit the milk on the stove. Got that? Good!

-= Bedroom =-
You've entered a bedroom. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

You make out a chest drawer. You see a closed antique trunk. You can see a king-size bed. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. This always happens, here in TextWorld!

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game, and they've been following the instructions step by step. The current goal is to unlock the wooden door, which they just did using the old key. Now, the next step according to the original task was to open the wooden door. So after unlocking it, they need to open it.

Wait, the user just unlocked the door, and the next prompt says "Do you think you're making the right actions..." So the user is asking if they're on the right track. The assistant needs to confirm that they are, and then proceed with the next action.

The next action in the original instructions was to open the wooden door. So after unlocking, the next step is to open it. The user has already unlocked it, so now they need to open it. The correct command here would be "open wooden door". The user has to make sure they do that. Then, after opening the door, they need to go east, check the refrigerator, get the milk, etc.

So the next command should be "open wooden door". The user has to input that. The assistant's job is to output that command without any extra text. The user's previous action was unlocking the door, and now they need to open it. The score is at 3/4, so they need to proceed correctly. The assistant should confirm that the actions so far are correct and then proceed with the next step.

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place. The room is well lit.

Oh, great. Here's a refrigerator. You make out a counter. The counter is ordinary. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. You see a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You can see a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island. Huh, weird.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps in the game. They started in the bedroom, opened the chest drawer, took the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, then went east to the kitchen. Now they're in the kitchen, and the task is to make sure the refrigerator is ajar, then pick up the milk.

The user tried "make sure refrigerator is ajar" but got an error. Then they tried "open refrigerator", which worked. Now the refrigerator is open, and there's milk and lettuce inside. The next step is to pick up the milk. The correct command should be "take milk from refrigerator" or something similar. But the game might expect a specific verb. Since the previous action was "open refrigerator", the next logical step is to take the milk. So the next command should be "take milk from refrigerator".
