I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, open the antique trunk. And then, retrieve the old key from the antique trunk. With the old key, unlock the wooden door inside the bedroom with the old key. Then, ensure that the wooden door is open. And then, head east. After that, ensure that the screen door is open. And then, head east. And then, try to move south. And then, pick-up the bell pepper from the floor of the garden. With the bell pepper, attempt to head north. With that accomplished, go to the west. And then, place the bell pepper on the stove. Alright, thanks!

-= Bedroom =-
Ah, the bedroom. This is some kind of bedroom, really great normal vibes in this place, a wonderful normal atmosphere. You can barely contain your excitement.

You can make out a closed chest drawer in the room. You can see a closed antique trunk nearby. You make out a king-size bed. The king-size bed is normal. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. It seems to be pretty usual here.

Were you looking for a refrigerator? Because look over there, it's a refrigerator. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. The counter appears to be empty. You scan the room, seeing a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is typical. On the kitchen island you make out a note. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can see a patio table. The patio table is typical. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is an open screen door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in the game and has been trying to pick up the bell pepper. They've tried "pick up the bell pepper from the floor" and "take the bell pepper from the floor" but both times the game responded that the bell pepper isn't visible. The current location is the Garden, where the description mentions there's a milk, a half of a bag of chips, a bell pepper, and a shovel on the floor. Wait, maybe the user is using the wrong command structure. In TextWorld, the correct command would be "take bell pepper" without specifying "from the floor" since the game might automatically recognize it's on the floor. Alternatively, maybe the game expects "pick up" instead of "take". But the user tried both. The game's response says "You can't see any such thing," which is confusing because the description does mention the bell pepper is on the floor. Maybe there's a typo in the item name? The user might need to use the exact name as in the game's inventory. Let me check the previous messages. The garden's description says "a bell pepper and a shovel on the floor." So the correct command should be "take bell pepper" or "pick up bell pepper". The user tried "pick up the bell pepper from the floor" which might be too verbose. The game might not recognize "the" or "from the floor". So the next action should be to take the bell pepper directly. Let me try that.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's recap the user's progress so far. They started in the Bedroom, opened an antique trunk, retrieved an old key, unlocked a wooden door, and moved east to the Kitchen. Then they opened a screen door and went east to the Backyard. From there, they went south to the Garden. In the Garden, they picked up a bell pepper but had trouble with the command. After some back-and-forth, they finally took the bell pepper and tried to go north with it.

Now, the user is in the Garden, has the bell pepper, and the next step is to place it on the stove. The current room description mentions a stove in the Kitchen, but the user is in the Garden. Wait, maybe they need to go back to the Kitchen first. But the user's last action was trying to go north with the bell pepper, which might not be possible directly. The Garden's description says to try going north, so perhaps that's the way to go. But the user needs to place the bell pepper on the stove, which is in the Kitchen. So the correct sequence would be: go north from the Garden to the Kitchen, then put the bell pepper on the stove. However, the user is currently in the Garden, so the next step is to go north. The user has the bell pepper, so after moving to the Kitchen, they can put it on the stove. The previous attempts to go north with the bell pepper didn't work, but maybe just going north first is the right move. So the next command should be 'go north' to reach the Kitchen, then 'put bell pepper on stove'.

You can see a set of chairs. However, the set of chairs, like an empty set of chairs, has nothing on it. You move on, clearly done caring about TextWorld. You can make out a bbq.

There is an open screen door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out what's going on here. The user is stuck in a loop between the Garden and Backyard, constantly going back and forth. The original goal was to place the bell pepper on the stove, which is in the Kitchen. But the user has been moving between rooms without making progress.

First, the user picked up the bell pepper in the Garden. The next step should be to go to the Kitchen where the stove is. However, the current room is the Garden, and the available commands suggest that going north is the way to go. But every time the user tries to go north, they end up in the Backyard again. Wait, maybe the path from the Garden to the Kitchen isn't directly north. Maybe there's a different route.

Looking at the room descriptions: The Garden has a screen door leading west, and the Backyard has a screen door leading east. The user tried going south from the Garden, which brings them back to the Garden. But the Kitchen is supposed to be east of the Backyard. Wait, earlier in the game, the user was in the Kitchen after opening the screen door. Maybe the user is stuck in a loop because they can't find the right path back to the Kitchen.

The user needs to go from the Garden to the Kitchen. The Garden's description says to try going north, but that leads to the Backyard. The Backyard has a screen door leading west, which might be the way back to the Garden. But the Kitchen is east of the Backyard. So maybe the user needs to go east from the Backyard to reach the Kitchen again. But the user is currently in the Backyard, so the correct command would be to go east. However, the user has been trying to go south and north, which isn't working. The user needs to go east from the Backyard to reach the Kitchen. But the user is in the Backyard, so the next step should be to go east. But the user hasn't tried that yet. So the correct command is "go east" from the Backyard to reach the Kitchen, then put the bell pepper on the stove.

There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it.
