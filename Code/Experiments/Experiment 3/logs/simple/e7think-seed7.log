Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an fast paced round of TextWorld? You do! Here is your task for today. First of all, you could, like, make sure that the chest drawer is wide open. After opening the chest drawer, pick up the old key from the chest drawer. Having got the old key, make sure that the wooden door is unlocked with the old key. And then, open the wooden door. After that, travel east. That done, ensure that the refrigerator inside the kitchen is open. And then, recover the apple from the refrigerator. After taking the apple, rest the apple on the stove in the kitchen. Alright, thanks!

-= Bedroom =-
You arrive in a bedroom. An ordinary kind of place. You can barely contain your excitement.

Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a chest drawer. Now why would someone leave that there? If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's an antique trunk. You can see a king-size bed. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The king-size bed is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

You've entered a kitchen.

Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a refrigerator. Now why would someone leave that there? You see a counter. The counter is typical. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a stove. The stove is standard. But there isn't a thing on it. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. Oh, great. Here's a kitchen island. The kitchen island is usual. On the kitchen island you can make out a note. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this!

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this TextWorld game and has followed a set of steps. Let me recap what's been done so far.

First, they opened the chest drawer in the bedroom, picked up the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door leading east, which took them to the kitchen. Now, in the kitchen, they opened the refrigerator and found a bell pepper and an apple. The next step according to the original task was to recover the apple from the refrigerator. So the user has already done that by opening the fridge and finding the apple. But the next step mentioned was to rest the apple on the stove in the kitchen. 

Looking at the current location, the kitchen has a stove. The user needs to take the apple from the refrigerator, then place it on the stove. Since the refrigerator is already open, the next logical steps are to take the apple and then put it on the stove. The user's last action was opening the refrigerator, so the next command should be to take the apple. After that, they need to go to the stove and put it there. But the user's next action should be to take the apple first. The current prompt shows the refrigerator is open, so the user can take the apple from there. Then, they need to go to the stove, which is in the kitchen, and put the apple on it. 

Wait, the user is in the kitchen now. The stove is mentioned as being present. So after taking the apple, they need to go to the stove. But the command to put the apple on the stove would require first taking it from the fridge. So the immediate next step is to take the apple. Then, move to the stove and put it there. The user's next action should be "take apple from refrigerator" or something similar. But in the game's context, the correct command would be "take apple" since the apple is in the open refrigerator. So the next command is to take the apple.
</think>take apple from refrigerator
