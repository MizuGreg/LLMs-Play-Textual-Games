You are now playing a exciting game of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First stop, assure that the chest drawer in the bedroom is wide open. And then, pick up the old key from the chest drawer inside the bedroom. Then, check that the wooden door is unlocked with the old key. After unlocking the wooden door, assure that the wooden door is wide open. After that, head east. Then, ensure that the screen door in the kitchen is open. Then, make an attempt to move east. With that accomplished, make an attempt to head south. Then, pick-up the lettuce from the floor of the garden. Then, travel north. Then, try to take a trip west. Then, rest the lettuce on the stove inside the kitchen. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Bedroom =-
You arrive in a bedroom. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You make out a chest drawer. What's that over there? It looks like it's an antique trunk. Were you looking for a king-size bed? Because look over there, it's a king-size bed. The king-size bed is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.

You see a closed refrigerator. What's that over there? It looks like it's a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is ordinary. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. What's the point of an empty counter? You can see a stove. The stove is usual. The stove appears to be empty. You see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is standard. On the kitchen island you make out a note. Hmmm... what else, what else?

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? Oh, great. Here's a bbq. The bbq appears to be empty. Hm. Oh well Look over there! a patio table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the patio table.

There is an open screen door leading west. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps in the TextWorld game. They started in the bedroom, opened the chest drawer, picked up the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, then went east to the kitchen. They opened the screen door, went east again to the backyard, then south to the garden.

Now, in the garden, they've found a half-bag of chips, lettuce, bell pepper, and a shovel on the floor. The next step according to the original task was to pick up the lettuce from the floor of the garden. The user hasn't done that yet. So the next action should be to pick up the lettuce. Then they need to travel north, try to go west, rest the lettuce on the stove, etc. But the current step is to pick up the lettuce. So the correct command here is "pick up lettuce".

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, let's recap the user's progress in the game. They started in the bedroom, opened the chest drawer, picked up the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, then moved east to the kitchen. They opened the screen door, went east to the backyard, then south to the garden. In the garden, they picked up the lettuce. Now, the next step according to the original task was to travel north, then try to go west, rest the lettuce on the stove in the kitchen.

But the user tried to "put lettuce on stove in kitchen" and the game responded that they can't see the stove. So maybe the stove is in the kitchen, which they've already been to. The user is currently in the garden, so they need to go back to the kitchen. The correct command would be to "go north" from the garden to return to the kitchen. Then, once in the kitchen, they can put the lettuce on the stove. But since the user is in the garden, the next step is to go north to the kitchen. So the correct command here is "go north".

You're now in the backyard. You begin looking for stuff.

You make out a set of chairs. The set of chairs is ordinary. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? Oh, great. Here's a bbq. The bbq appears to be empty. Hm. Oh well Look over there! a patio table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the patio table.

There is an open screen door leading west. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Garden, and they have the lettuce in their inventory. The next step according to the original plan was to rest the lettuce on the stove inside the kitchen. But the user tried to "put lettuce on stove in kitchen" and the game said they can't see the stove. So maybe the stove is in the kitchen, which they've already been to.

Okay, the user is trying to put the lettuce on the stove in the kitchen, but they're in the garden. They need to go back to the kitchen first. The correct command would be to go north from the garden to reach the kitchen. Then, once in the kitchen, they can put the lettuce on the stove. But since they're currently in the garden, the next step is to go north.

You're now in the backyard. You begin looking for stuff.

You make out a set of chairs. The set of chairs is ordinary. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? Oh, great. Here's a bbq. The bbq appears to be empty. Hm. Oh well Look over there! a patio table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the patio table.

There is an open screen door leading west. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

You've just shown up in a garden. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?



There is an unblocked exit to the north.

There is a half of a bag of chips, a bell pepper and a shovel on the floor.

You're now in the backyard. You begin looking for stuff.

You make out a set of chairs. The set of chairs is ordinary. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? Oh, great. Here's a bbq. The bbq appears to be empty. Hm. Oh well Look over there! a patio table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the patio table.

There is an open screen door leading west. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Garden and Backyard, trying to get to the kitchen. The main issue is that they're not in the kitchen yet. The correct path is to go north from the Garden to the Kitchen. But the user keeps getting redirected back to the Backyard. The solution is to keep trying to go north from the Garden until they reach the Kitchen. The command should be "go north" again.
