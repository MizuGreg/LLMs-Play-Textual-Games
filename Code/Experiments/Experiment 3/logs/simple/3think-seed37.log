Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an exciting round of TextWorld? You do! First, it would be fantastic if you could ensure that the chest drawer is open. After that, recover the old key from the chest drawer. Then, check that the wooden door is unlocked with the old key. And then, ensure that the wooden door within the bedroom is open. And then, head east. And then, make absolutely sure that the screen door within the kitchen is wide open. After that, make an effort to go to the east. With that accomplished, make an attempt to go south. With that accomplished, lift the milk from the floor of the garden. After that, try to venture north. Then, make an attempt to travel west. With that done, rest the milk on the stove within the kitchen. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Bedroom =-
I am excited to announce that you are now in the bedroom.

You see a closed chest drawer. You can make out an antique trunk. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You can make out a king-size bed! But the thing is empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the king-size bed.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me see. The user is playing this TextWorld game, and they've been following a set of steps. So far, they've opened the chest drawer, taken the old key, and now they're in the bedroom. The next step in the original plan was to check that the wooden door is unlocked with the old key. Then ensure the door is open, head east, make sure the screen door in the kitchen is open, go east again, try to go south, lift the milk from the garden, venture north, travel west, rest the milk on the stove, and then stop.

Wait, the current location is the bedroom. The user has the old key. The next step mentioned was to check the wooden door is unlocked with the key. So the next action should be to unlock the wooden door. But how? The key might be used to unlock it. So the command would be "unlock wooden door with old key" or something similar. But in the game's context, maybe just "unlock wooden door" if the key is already in hand. Let me check the previous actions. The user took the old key from the chest drawer, so they have it. The wooden door is closed and leads east. So the next step is to unlock it with the key. The correct command here would be "unlock wooden door" since the key is in the inventory. The user's next action should be that.

You see a closed refrigerator nearby. You can see a counter. The counter is typical. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What's the point of an empty counter? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make out a kitchen island. The kitchen island is normal. On the kitchen island you can make out a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text adventure game, and they've been following a series of steps to open the chest drawer, get the key, unlock and open the wooden door, then go east into the kitchen. Now they're in the kitchen, and the next step according to the original instructions was to make sure the screen door is wide open. The user has to check if the screen door is open. If it's closed, they need to open it. The current description says the screen door is closed, so the next action should be to open it. The user's previous action was going east, which led them to the kitchen. Now, the next step is to open the screen door leading east. So the correct command here is "open screen door".

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user has been following a series of steps in this text-based game. The original goal was to perform a series of actions in specific order: open the chest drawer, get the key, unlock the door, open the door, go east, open the screen door, go east again, then go south to the garden, and then lift the milk from the floor of the garden. 

So far, the user has reached the garden. The current location is the Garden, and the items there include a milk, a half-bag of chips, a tomato plant, and a shovel. The next step in the original plan was to "lift the milk from the floor of the garden." The user has to pick up the milk. The command for that would be "take milk from floor" or something similar. But in the game's context, the correct command might be "lift milk" or "take milk." Since the user is at the Garden, and the milk is on the floor, the next action should be to take the milk.

The user's last action was going south to the garden, and now they need to pick up the milk. The response should be the command to take the milk. The user's previous actions have been following the steps correctly, so this is the next logical step. The user needs to make sure they pick up the milk as per the instructions. So the correct command here is "take milk from floor" or "lift milk." But looking at the previous commands, the user used "take old key from chest drawer," so maybe the format is "take milk from floor." However, in some games, you just say "take milk" if it's on the floor. But given the previous examples, the user might need to specify "from floor." But in the current description, the milk is on the floor, so the correct command would be "take milk from floor." However, the user might just say "take milk" if the game allows that. But since the user previously had to specify "from chest drawer," maybe the correct command here is "take milk from floor." But the user's last action was "go south," and the next step is to lift the milk. So the answer should be "take milk from floor."

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to pick up the milk from the floor in the garden. They've tried "take milk from floor" and "pick up milk from floor", but both times the game responded that the milk isn't visible. The current location is the Garden, where the description mentions a milk, a half of a bag of chips, a tomato plant, and a shovel on the floor.

Wait, maybe the game is using a different terminology. Instead of "take", maybe the correct verb is "get" or "pick up". But the user already tried "pick up". Alternatively, maybe the milk is not directly on the floor but somewhere else. Let me check the game's current state again.

The garden has the milk on the floor. The user's previous attempts to take it didn't work. Maybe the correct command is "take milk" without specifying "from floor", since the milk is already on the floor. Or perhaps the game expects "get milk from floor". But the user tried "take milk from floor" and it didn't work. Maybe the game is case-sensitive or uses a different phrasing.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to first check the floor for the milk. But the game's description already states that the milk is on the floor. So the correct action should be to take it. Maybe the game's parser is not recognizing "take" for this item. Maybe the correct verb is "get" instead. Let me think of possible commands: "get milk", "take milk", "pick up milk". The user tried "pick up milk from floor" and it didn't work. Maybe the correct command is just "take milk" since the milk is on the floor. Let me try that.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following a series of steps in this text-based game. The goal was to perform a series of actions in specific rooms, starting from the bedroom, then moving through the kitchen, backyard, garden, and so on. The user has already completed most of the required steps up to the garden, where they picked up the milk.

Now, the current location is the kitchen again, after going west from the backyard. The next step in the original plan was to "rest the milk on the stove within the kitchen." The user has the milk in their inventory, as they picked it up in the garden. So the next logical step is to go to the stove in the kitchen and place the milk there.

Looking at the current room description, there's a stove mentioned, and the kitchen island has a note. The user needs to go to the stove, which is part of the kitchen. Since the stove is in the kitchen, the user should move to the stove's location and then place the milk there. The command would be "put milk on stove" or something similar. However, in the game's context, the exact command might be "put milk on stove" or "rest milk on stove" as per previous actions. The user has already picked up the milk, so the next step is to place it on the stove. The correct command here would be "put milk on stove" to complete that part of the goal.
