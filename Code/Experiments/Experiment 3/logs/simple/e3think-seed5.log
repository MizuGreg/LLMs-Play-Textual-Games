You are now playing a life changing session of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First thing I need you to do is to assure that the chest drawer in the bedroom is open. Then, retrieve the old key from the chest drawer in the bedroom. After that, unlock the wooden door with the old key. And then, ensure that the wooden door in the bedroom is open. After that, make an attempt to move east. Following that, open the refrigerator. And then, pick up the apple from the refrigerator. After that, rest the apple on the stove. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Bedroom =-
You are in a bedroom. A normal one. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You make out a chest drawer. You can make out an antique trunk. You smell a wretched smell, and follow it to a king-size bed. The king-size bed is standard. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me see. The user is playing this text adventure game. Their goal is to open the chest drawer, get the old key, unlock the door, open the door, move east, open the fridge, pick up the apple, put it on the stove, and win.

So far, they've opened the chest drawer and retrieved the old key. The score is now 2 out of 3. The next step according to the original plan is to unlock the wooden door with the old key. The user has the key, so they need to use it on the door. The door is closed, so they need to unlock it. The command would be "unlock wooden door with old key". But in the game's context, maybe the correct command is "use old key on wooden door" or "unlock wooden door". Let me check the previous interactions. The user tried "unlock wooden door with the old key" but the system said that's not a recognized verb. Then they tried "take old key from chest drawer", which worked. So maybe the correct command is "unlock wooden door" after using the key. Alternatively, "use old key on wooden door". But the user's next action should be to unlock the door. The system might accept "unlock wooden door" if the key is in hand. Since the user has the key, they can proceed to unlock the door. So the next command should be "unlock wooden door".

GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Kitchen =-
Ah, the kitchen. This is some kind of kitchen, really great standard vibes in this place, a wonderful standard atmosphere. And now, well, you're in it.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a refrigerator. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. The counter appears to be empty. You see a stove. The stove is usual. But there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is standard. On the kitchen island you see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

Okay, the user is in the kitchen now. Their next goal is to open the refrigerator. The previous steps were successful: they unlocked the door, opened it, and moved east to the kitchen. Now, the fridge is closed. The command should be "open refrigerator". Let me check the previous interactions. The user has to use the correct verb. The system might accept "open refrigerator" or "open the refrigerator". Since the user has been using commands like "open chest drawer" and "open wooden door", the next step is likely "open refrigerator".

Okay, the user has the apple now. The next step is to rest the apple on the stove. The command should be "put apple on stove" or "rest apple on stove". Since the game might use more precise verbs, "put apple on stove" is likely the correct command. Let me check previous commands. The user used "take apple from refrigerator", so "put apple on stove" would follow logically.
