I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is how to play! First, it would be great if you could ensure that the chest drawer within the bedroom is open. And then, retrieve the old key from the chest drawer. And then, unlock the wooden door with the old key. And then, ensure that the wooden door within the bedroom is open. And then, make an attempt to go east. And then, open the screen door. After opening the screen door, make an effort to go to the east. Then, take a trip south. And then, retrieve the bell pepper from the floor of the garden. If you can get your hands on the bell pepper, head north. Then, travel west. After that, rest the bell pepper on the stove. Got that? Good!

-= Bedroom =-
You're now in the bedroom. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You can make out a chest drawer. You can see a closed antique trunk. You make out a king-size bed. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Hm. Oh well

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

You've just sauntered into a kitchen.

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a refrigerator. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a counter. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. You make out a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. The stove is ordinary. The stove appears to be empty. You can see a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

If you're wondering why everything seems so ordinary all of a sudden, it's because you've just walked into the backyard. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You can see a set of chairs. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a set of chairs, go to TextWorld. The set of chairs is usual. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You see a bbq. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You swear loudly. You can see a patio table. Now why would someone leave that there? But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game called TextWorld, and they've followed a set of instructions to complete certain tasks. The goal seems to be to retrieve the bell pepper and then perform some actions in the garden.

First, the user has already opened the chest drawer, retrieved the old key, unlocked the wooden door, opened the screen door, and gone east to the backyard. Then they went south to the garden. In the garden, there's a bell pepper on the floor. The user tried to "retrieve bell pepper from floor" but got an error. Then they tried "take bell pepper from floor" and the game said they can't see any such thing. 

Wait, maybe the correct verb is "take" instead of "retrieve"? But the game's response was "You can't see any such thing." So maybe the bell pepper isn't there? But the description says there's a bell pepper on the floor. Hmm. Maybe the user needs to check again. Alternatively, maybe the correct command is just "take bell pepper" without specifying the location. Let me check the previous steps.

In the Garden description, it says: "There is a half of a bag of chips, an apple, a bell pepper and a shovel on the floor." So the bell pepper is indeed there. The user tried "take bell pepper from floor" but got an error. Maybe the correct command is just "take bell pepper" because the game might automatically know it's on the floor. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use "get" instead of "take". But in TextWorld, the usual verbs are "take", "get", "use", etc. 

Wait, the user's previous action was "go south" to the garden. Then the next step was to retrieve the bell pepper. The user tried "retrieve bell pepper from floor" which the game didn't recognize. Then tried "take bell pepper from floor" and got "You can't see any such thing." So maybe the correct command is just "take bell pepper" without specifying the floor. Let me think. In TextWorld, if an object is on the floor, you can just say "take bell pepper" and it should work. Maybe the user needs to try that. 

So the next action should be "take bell pepper". If that doesn't work, maybe the game expects a different command. But according to the instructions, after retrieving the bell pepper, the user should head north. So once the bell pepper is taken, they need to go north. But first, they need to take the bell pepper. So the correct command here is "take bell pepper".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to complete a series of tasks in TextWorld. They've already retrieved the bell pepper and are now trying to put it on the stove. But in the Backyard, there's no stove mentioned. The previous location was the Garden, where they picked up the bell pepper. When they went back to the Backyard, the stove isn't there. So the problem is that the stove isn't in the Backyard, which is where they are now. The user might have confused the locations. The stove is in the Kitchen, which they previously visited. But since they're in the Backyard now, they can't access the stove here. Therefore, the correct action would be to go back to the Kitchen to place the bell pepper on the stove. But the user's last action was trying to put it on the stove in the Backyard, which isn't possible. So the next step should be to go north back to the Kitchen.

<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text adventure game, and they've reached a point where they need to put the bell pepper on the stove. But every time they try, the game says they can't see the stove or the bell pepper.

First, I need to check the previous steps. The user retrieved the bell pepper from the garden and went back to the backyard. The current location is the backyard, and the items mentioned there are chairs, a BBQ, a patio table, and the screen door. The stove wasn't mentioned in the backyard description. The user tried to put the bell pepper on the stove, but since the stove isn't in the backyard, that's why it's not working.

So the mistake is assuming the stove is in the backyard. The stove was in the kitchen, as per the kitchen description. The user was in the backyard after going east from the kitchen. To put the bell pepper on the stove, they need to go back to the kitchen. But the user is currently in the backyard, and the exit to the north is blocked. The only exits are west (screen door) and south. Going west would take them back to the kitchen, where the stove is located. Then they can put the bell pepper on the stove there.

So the correct next step is to go west back to the kitchen, then put the bell pepper on the stove. But the user is stuck in the backyard, so the first action should be to go west to the kitchen. Then, once in the kitchen, they can put the bell pepper on the stove. The user might have forgotten that the stove is in the kitchen, not the backyard. Therefore, the next action should be to go west to the kitchen.

-= Kitchen =-
You've just sauntered into a kitchen.

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a refrigerator. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a counter. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. You make out a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. The stove is ordinary. The stove appears to be empty. You can see a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.
