Welcome to another life changing episode of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, you could, like, doublecheck that the chest drawer is opened. Once you have opened the chest drawer, recover the old key from the chest drawer within the bedroom. And then, unlock the wooden door. Then, open the wooden door. Once you have opened the wooden door, attempt to go to the east. With that accomplished, make absolutely sure that the refrigerator within the kitchen is ajar. Then, pick up the milk from the refrigerator. After taking the milk, sit the milk on the stove. Got that? Good!

-= Bedroom =-
You've entered a bedroom. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

You make out a chest drawer. You see a closed antique trunk. You can see a king-size bed. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. This always happens, here in TextWorld!

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place. The room is well lit.

Oh, great. Here's a refrigerator. You make out a counter. The counter is ordinary. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. You see a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You can see a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island. Huh, weird.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game and has reached the kitchen. Their current task is to make sure the refrigerator is ajar. They tried "make sure refrigerator is ajar" but the system said that's not a recognized verb. So I need to figure out the correct command.

Looking back at the previous steps, the user had to open the wooden door and go east to get to the kitchen. Now, in the kitchen, the refrigerator is mentioned as closed. The goal is to make sure it's ajar, which probably means opening it. The correct verb here would be "open" followed by the object. So the right command should be "open refrigerator".

The user might have used "make sure" incorrectly, but the game expects a verb like "open". So the next action should be to open the refrigerator. Let me check the previous interactions. The user had to "unlock" and "open" doors, so following that pattern, "open refrigerator" makes sense. That should complete the task of making the fridge ajar. Then, after that, they need to pick up the milk from the refrigerator. But first, the fridge needs to be open. So the correct next step is to open the refrigerator.
