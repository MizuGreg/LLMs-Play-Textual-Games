I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First off, ensure that the antique trunk within the bedroom is open. After that, recover the old key from the antique trunk. After that, make it so that the wooden door in the bedroom is unlocked with the old key. And then, make absolutely sure that the wooden door inside the bedroom is ajar. After opening the wooden door, go east. Then, doublecheck that the screen door is wide open. And then, attempt to travel east. And then, try to travel south. With that done, lift the milk from the floor of the garden. After stealing the milk, head north. And then, attempt to travel west. With that done, rest the milk on the stove. That's it!

-= Bedroom =-
I am sorry to announce that you are now in the bedroom. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a chest drawer. You scan the room for an antique trunk, and you find an antique trunk. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to a king-size bed. The king-size bed is standard. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. You think about smashing the king-size bed to bits, throwing the bits in the dump, etc, until you get bored.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me try to figure out what the user needs here. They're in a text-based game called TextWorld, and their task is to follow a series of steps to complete a quest. So far, they've opened an antique trunk, taken an old key, unlocked a wooden door, and tried to make the door ajar. But the system responded that "ajar wooden door" isn't a recognized verb.

Hmm, the user is probably trying to make the door open fully. The previous step was unlocking the door, so maybe the next step is to open it. But the game might use specific commands. The user tried "ajar," which isn't working. Maybe the correct command is "open wooden door" instead. Let me check the previous interactions. The user had to "unlock" the door, so maybe "open" is the next action. Alternatively, maybe "push" or "pull" if the door is locked but unlocked. Wait, the user already unlocked it, so perhaps just opening it. The system might expect "open" as the command. Let me make sure. The user's last action was "ajar wooden door," which failed. So the next step should be to try "open wooden door." That makes sense. The user needs to open the door after unlocking it. So the correct command is "open wooden door."

You can see a closed refrigerator in the room. You can make out a counter. The counter is usual. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. You scan the room, seeing a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. You can see a kitchen island. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? On the kitchen island you can see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Okay, let me figure out what the user needs here. They're in a text-based game where they have to follow specific steps to complete a quest. So far, they've opened the antique trunk, taken the key, unlocked the door, opened the door, went east to the kitchen, and opened the screen door. The next step in their original task was to travel east after opening the screen door, then try to travel south. But the user might be confused about the commands.

The user's last action was opening the screen door, which was step 6 out of 7. The next step according to the original task was to "attempt to travel east" after opening the screen door. But in the kitchen, there's a closed refrigerator, a counter, a stove, a kitchen island with a note, a screen door east, a wooden door west, and exits north and south. The user is in the kitchen now, so traveling east would be through the screen door. But the screen door was just opened, so maybe they can go east. However, the user might have already done that. Wait, the original task said after opening the screen door, go east, then try to travel south. So after opening the screen door, the next command should be "go east" to move into the next room. Then, from there, try to go south. But the user is in the kitchen, so after opening the screen door, they need to go east. But the screen door is leading east, so maybe "go east" is the next command. However, the user might have already done that. Alternatively, maybe they need to check if the screen door is open and then proceed. But the user just opened it, so "go east" would be the next step. The system might expect "go east" as the command. Let me check the previous steps. The user was in the kitchen, and the screen door is east. So the next action is to go east. Then, from the east room, try to go south. But the user's next step after opening the screen door is to go east. So the correct command is "go east".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the steps in the game. They're in the Garden, and the task is to lift the milk from the floor. The previous attempt was "lift milk from floor of garden," which didn't work. The system said "That's not a verb I recognise," so maybe the correct command is different.

Looking at the current room description: "There is a milk, a half of a bag of chips, a lettuce and a shovel on the floor." So the milk is on the floor. The user needs to pick it up. The correct command should be "take milk" or "pick up milk." But the user tried "lift," which might not be recognized. The game might expect "take" as the verb. So the next action should be "take milk." Let me check the previous commands. The user tried "lift milk from floor of garden," which was incorrect. The correct command is likely "take milk" without specifying the floor since it's implied. So the next step is to take the milk.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Backyard again after trying to go north from the Garden. The original goal was to lift the milk from the garden floor, then head north, then attempt to travel west. But the user tried "head north" which wasn't recognized, then "go north" which worked, but now they're back in the Backyard.

Wait, the last action was "go north" from the Garden, which led them back to the Backyard. Now, the next step according to the original task was to "attempt to travel west" after going north. So from the Backyard, they need to go west through the open screen door. The current room has a screen door leading west. So the correct command should be "go west" or "west". The user needs to move west from the Backyard. The previous steps were correct up to this point. So the next action is to go west.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Kitchen again after going south from the Bathroom. The original goal was to rest the milk on the stove. So far, they've lifted the milk from the garden, headed north, went west, north again, and now back in the kitchen. The next step should be to rest the milk on the stove. The command would be "put milk on stove" or "rest milk on stove". Since the game might use "put" as the verb, but the user's previous action was "rest", maybe that's the correct command. Let me check the previous steps. The user had to "rest the milk on the stove" as per the original task. So the correct command is "rest milk on stove".
