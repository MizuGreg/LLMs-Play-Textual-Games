It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First stop, open the chest drawer. And then, pick up the old key from the chest drawer within the bedroom. After picking up the old key, make it so that the wooden door is unlocked. After that, ensure that the wooden door within the bedroom is open. After that, move east. With that done, open the screen door. And then, go east. Following that, try to move south. Okay, and then, recover the apple from the floor of the garden. If you can get your hands on the apple, head north. That done, try to head west. And then, put the apple on the stove in the kitchen. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Bedroom =-
You find yourself in a bedroom. A typical kind of place. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You see a chest drawer. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can make out a closed antique trunk here. You see a king-size bed. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You swear loudly.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

You've just sauntered into a kitchen.

You make out a closed refrigerator. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. But there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the counter. You see a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a kitchen island! The kitchen island is normal. On the kitchen island you can see a note. Huh, weird.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

There is an open screen door leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to complete a series of tasks in this text-based game. So far, they've opened a chest drawer, picked up an old key, unlocked and opened a wooden door, moved east to the kitchen, opened a screen door, moved east again to the backyard, then south to the garden. In the garden, they need to recover the apple from the floor.

The user tried "recover apple" but it wasn't recognized. Then they tried "take apple from floor" but couldn't see it. Then they tried "look around" but that wasn't helpful. The game's response says they can't see the apple. Wait, but in the garden description, it says there's an apple on the floor. Maybe the player needs to use a different command. Let me check the previous steps again.

In the garden, the description says: "There is a milk, an apple, a lettuce and a shovel on the floor." So the apple is there. The user tried "take apple from floor" but the game said they can't see it. Maybe the correct command is just "take apple" without specifying the location? Or maybe "pick up apple"? Alternatively, maybe the game expects the player to use "take" instead of "pick up". Let me think about the possible commands. The user previously used "pick up old key" which worked. So maybe "pick up apple" would be the correct command here. Alternatively, "take apple" might be the right verb. Since "take apple from floor" didn't work, perhaps the game expects the player to just take the apple directly. Let me try that. The next action should be "take apple" or "pick up apple". The user needs to try that.

You pick up the apple from the ground.

Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out what's going on here. The user is in a text-based game where they need to follow a series of steps to reach the goal. So far, they've completed most of the tasks: opening the chest drawer, getting the key, unlocking and opening the door, moving east, opening the screen door, going to the garden, picking up the apple, and then they've been wandering between the kitchen, bathroom, and back to the kitchen again.

The current goal is to put the apple on the stove in the kitchen. The user has the apple, so the next step should be to go back to the kitchen and place it on the stove. But in the latest moves, they've been going back and forth between the kitchen and bathroom, which might be a mistake. They need to focus on getting to the kitchen again and then interacting with the stove.

The user tried "go north" and "go south" repeatedly, which is causing them to loop between rooms. The correct path is to go back to the kitchen from the backyard, then to the stove. Since they've already picked up the apple, they need to head back to the kitchen and put it on the stove. The next action should be to go west from the kitchen to the backyard, then south to the garden, but wait, no—the stove is in the kitchen. So maybe they need to go back to the kitchen from the bathroom, then to the stove.

Wait, the user is currently in the bathroom, so they need to go south back to the kitchen. Once in the kitchen, they can go to the stove and put the apple there. The correct command would be "go south" from the bathroom to the kitchen, then "go to stove" or something similar. But in the game's context, the command might be "put apple on stove" once they're in the kitchen. However, the user hasn't been in the kitchen recently, so they need to navigate back.

The user's last action was "go north" to the bathroom, so the next step should be "go south" back to the kitchen. Then, once in the kitchen, they can interact with the stove. The key is to avoid looping between rooms and focus on the stove in the kitchen. So the next command should be "go south" to return to the kitchen.

-= Kitchen =-
You've just sauntered into a kitchen.

You make out a closed refrigerator. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. But there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the counter. You see a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a kitchen island! The kitchen island is normal. On the kitchen island you can see a note. Huh, weird.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.
