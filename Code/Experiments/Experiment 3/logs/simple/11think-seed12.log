I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First off, ensure that the antique trunk within the bedroom is open. After that, recover the old key from the antique trunk. After that, make it so that the wooden door in the bedroom is unlocked with the old key. And then, make absolutely sure that the wooden door inside the bedroom is ajar. After opening the wooden door, go east. Then, doublecheck that the screen door is wide open. And then, attempt to travel east. And then, try to travel south. With that done, lift the milk from the floor of the garden. After stealing the milk, head north. And then, attempt to travel west. With that done, rest the milk on the stove. That's it!

-= Bedroom =-
I am sorry to announce that you are now in the bedroom. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a chest drawer. You scan the room for an antique trunk, and you find an antique trunk. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to a king-size bed. The king-size bed is standard. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. You think about smashing the king-size bed to bits, throwing the bits in the dump, etc, until you get bored.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Of every kitchen you could have sauntered into, you had to walk into an ordinary one. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You can see a closed refrigerator in the room. You can make out a counter. The counter is usual. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. You scan the room, seeing a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. You can see a kitchen island. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? On the kitchen island you can see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

The bbq is usual. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm. Oh well You can see a patio table. However, the patio table, like an empty patio table, has nothing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this TextWorld game and has followed a series of steps. They've opened the antique trunk, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door, opened it, and then moved east to the kitchen. From there, they opened the screen door, went east to the backyard, and then south to the garden.

In the garden, they found milk, chips, lettuce, and a shovel on the floor. The next step in the original task was to lift the milk from the floor of the garden. The user hasn't done that yet. So the next action should be to pick up the milk. 

Looking at the current location, the garden has the milk on the floor. The command would be "take milk" or "lift milk". But in TextWorld, the correct verb might be "take". However, the user's previous action was "go south", and the current room is the garden. The milk is on the floor, so the next step is to take it. 

The user's last message was asking if they're on the right track. The assistant needs to confirm that lifting the milk is the next step. So the correct command here is "take milk".

Okay, the user is stuck in the Backyard and can't put the milk on the stove. Let me check the previous steps. They took the milk from the Garden, went back to the Backyard, and now they need to rest the milk on the stove. But in the Backyard description, there's no mention of a stove. The Kitchen had a stove, but they went east to the Backyard. So maybe the stove is in the Kitchen, and they need to go back to the Kitchen to put the milk on the stove. But the user is in the Backyard now. Let me check the exits again. The Backyard has a screen door west leading back to the Kitchen, and an exit south. So the correct action would be to go west back to the Kitchen, then put the milk on the stove. But the user is trying to put it in the Backyard where there's no stove. So the next step should be to go back to the Kitchen.
