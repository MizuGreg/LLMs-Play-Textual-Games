It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First step, doublecheck that the antique trunk in the bedroom is wide open. After that, pick up the old key from the antique trunk. After that, make it so that the wooden door inside the bedroom is unlocked with the old key. And then, ensure that the wooden door is open. Then, move east. Then, try to head south. Then, pick up the milk from the couch. Then, make an effort to travel north. Then, put the milk on the stove. That's it!

-= Bedroom =-
I never took you for the sort of person who would show up in a bedroom, but I guess I was wrong.

You can make out a closed chest drawer. You can make out a closed antique trunk. Hey, want to see a king-size bed? Look over there, a king-size bed. The king-size bed is usual. The king-size bed appears to be empty. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen.

You see a refrigerator. You make out a counter. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You can see a stove. The stove is ordinary. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. This always happens! Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an unguarded exit to the north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps in the TextWorld game. They started in the bedroom, opened the antique trunk, took the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, then moved east to the kitchen. Now, the next steps according to the original task were: after moving east, try to head south, pick up the milk from the couch, travel north, put the milk on the stove.

Wait, but in the kitchen, the user is now. The current location is the kitchen. The next step mentioned was "then, try to head south." So from the kitchen, the user needs to go south. Let me check the kitchen description again. The kitchen has an exit to the south. So the next action should be "go south". But wait, the user is in the kitchen, and the current description says there's an exit to the south. So the correct command here is "go south". The user's next move should be to go south from the kitchen. Then, after that, they need to pick up the milk from the couch. But first, they have to move to the room where the couch is. However, the current location is the kitchen, so moving south would take them to another room. Let me check the previous steps again to make sure I'm not missing anything. The original plan was: after moving east (to kitchen), try to head south. So the next action is "go south". Then, in the next room, they need to pick up the milk from the couch. But the user hasn't reached that room yet. So the immediate next step is to go south from the kitchen. The user's last action was "go east" to the kitchen, and now they need to "go south" from there. The assistant's next command should be "go south".

-= Living Room =-
You find yourself in a living room. A normal one.

Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a couch. On the couch you can make out a milk. You make out a low table. On the low table you make out a remote. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You see a tv. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.
