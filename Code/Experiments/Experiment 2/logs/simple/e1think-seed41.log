Welcome to TextWorld! Here is how to play! First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to ensure that the antique trunk is open. After that, recover the old key from the antique trunk within the bedroom. After that, unlock the wooden door. After that, open the wooden door. And then, venture east. Okay, and then, ensure that the refrigerator is open. And then, retrieve the tomato plant from the refrigerator in the kitchen. If you have taken the tomato plant, place the tomato plant on the stove within the kitchen. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Bedroom =-
Look around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a bedroom.

You can make out a closed chest drawer right there by you. You can see a closed antique trunk nearby. Look over there! a king-size bed. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a king-size bed, go to TextWorld. The king-size bed is normal. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me see. The user is in TextWorld and has already opened the antique trunk, which gave them an old key. Their next steps according to the initial instructions were to recover the key from the trunk, unlock the wooden door, open it, venture east, then handle the refrigerator and tomato plant.

Wait, the trunk was already opened, and the key was found inside. So the next step should be to use that key to unlock the wooden door. The wooden door is closed and leads east. So the next action should be to unlock the door. But how? The key might be needed to unlock it. So the user needs to take the key from the trunk, then use it on the door. But in the current state, after opening the trunk, the key is in the player's inventory. So the next step is to unlock the door. But the game might require using the key on the door. So the command would be "unlock wooden door" or "use key on wooden door". But the game's commands might be more straightforward. Let me check the previous steps. The user was told to "unlock the wooden door" after recovering the key. So after getting the key, the next action is to unlock the door. So the correct command here is "unlock wooden door".

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps given in the initial instructions. First, they opened the antique trunk and found an old key. Then they tried to unlock the wooden door, but it was fixed in place. Now, the next step according to the original plan was to open the wooden door after unlocking it. But since the door is fixed, maybe they need to use the key to unlock it.

Wait, the user just tried to unlock the wooden door, but the response says the door is fixed. So maybe the key is needed to unlock it. Since they have the key from the trunk, they should use it on the door. The next logical step would be to use the key on the wooden door to unlock it. Then, after that, they can open the door and proceed east as mentioned earlier. So the correct action here is to use the key on the door. The command should be "use key on wooden door" or something similar. But in the game's context, maybe the exact command is "unlock wooden door" again, but since it's fixed, perhaps they need to use the key. Alternatively, the game might require "use key on door" or "unlock door with key". But based on previous actions, the user tried "unlock wooden door" which didn't work. So maybe the correct command is "use key on wooden door".

Okay, let's see. The user tried to use the key on the wooden door but got an error because "use key on wooden door" isn't a valid command. The correct action here would be to "unlock" the door with the key. Since the key is already retrieved from the antique trunk, the next logical step is to use it to unlock the door. The previous attempt used "use key on wooden door," which didn't work. The correct verb here is "unlock," so the command should be "unlock wooden door." That makes sense because the key is meant to unlock the door. Let me check the game's possible commands again. Yes, "unlock" is the right verb. So the next action should be "unlock wooden door."

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to unlock the wooden door, but the key isn't working. They tried "unlock wooden door" again, but the door is still fixed. Maybe the key isn't the right tool here. Wait, the antique trunk had an old key. Maybe the door requires a different action. Let me check the previous steps.

The user opened the antique trunk and found the key. Then tried to unlock the door, but it didn't work. The error message says "That's not a verb I recognise." So maybe "unlock" isn't the correct verb here. Perhaps the correct action is to "use" the key on the door. But the user tried "use key on wooden door" before, but the system didn't recognize it. Wait, the user's last action was "unlock wooden door", which resulted in an error. So maybe the correct command is "use key on door" or "open door with key". Alternatively, maybe the door needs to be forced open, but that's not allowed. Or maybe the key is for the trunk, not the door. Wait, the original goal was to unlock the wooden door after getting the key from the trunk. So the key must be used on the door. But the system isn't recognizing "use key on door". Maybe the correct command is "open door with key". Let me think. The user has the key, so the next step is to use it on the door. The correct command might be "use key on door" or "unlock door with key". Since the system didn't accept "use key on wooden door", maybe it's "use key on door". Alternatively, maybe the door is locked and needs to be unlocked with the key. So the correct action is "unlock door with key". But the system might expect "use key on door". Let me check the possible commands. The user tried "unlock wooden door" which didn't work. So maybe the correct command is "use key on door". Let me try that.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to unlock the wooden door with the key they found in the antique trunk. They've tried "unlock wooden door" and "use key on door", but the latter wasn't recognized.

Hmm, maybe the correct command is "use key on wooden door"? The game might require specifying the object more clearly. Since the key is in the trunk, and the door is in the bedroom, the action needs to be directed at the door. The previous error was "use key on door" which might not be specific enough. Let me check the possible commands again. The user has to use the key on the door, so the correct syntax might be "use key on wooden door". That should work.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to unlock the wooden door using the key they found in the antique trunk. They've tried "unlock wooden door" and "use key on wooden door", but the game isn't recognizing those commands.

Hmm, maybe the correct command is "unlock door" without specifying "wooden" since the door is already identified as wooden in the context. Or perhaps "open door" if the key is meant to unlock it. Alternatively, the game might expect a different phrasing like "use key on door" or "unlock door with key".

Wait, the user previously tried "use key on wooden door" and got an error. Maybe the game expects "unlock door" as the main action, and the key is already in hand. Let me check the previous steps again. The user opened the trunk, found the key, then tried to unlock the door. The key is probably the correct item to use here. Maybe the correct command is "unlock door" without specifying the key, assuming the key is already in the inventory. Alternatively, "open door" if the key is needed to open it. But since the door is fixed, it's likely "unlock" is the right verb. Let me try "unlock door" as the next command.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to unlock the wooden door in the game. They have an old key from the antique trunk. The previous attempts to use the key didn't work because the game didn't recognize the command. The user tried "use key on wooden door" but got an error. Then they tried "unlock door" and the game asked, "What do you want to unlock wooden door with?" So, the game is expecting the user to specify the key as the tool for unlocking.

The correct action here is to use the key on the door. The previous mistake was not specifying the key in the command. The game's response indicates that the user needs to provide the object (the key) used for unlocking. So the correct command should be "use key on wooden door" again, but maybe the game requires the key to be in the inventory. Since the user already opened the trunk and took the key, it's probably in their inventory. Therefore, the next step is to use the key on the door. The user needs to input "use key on wooden door" again, but the game might have a specific syntax. Alternatively, maybe "unlock wooden door with key" is the correct syntax. But the user's previous attempt was "use key on wooden door", which was rejected. Wait, the user tried "use key on wooden door" and the game said "That's not a verb I recognise." So maybe the correct verb is "unlock" instead of "use". But the user tried "unlock wooden door" and the game said "What do you want to unlock wooden door with?" So the game is expecting the user to specify the key as the tool. Therefore, the correct command is "unlock wooden door with key". But the user's previous attempt was "use key on wooden door", which the game didn't recognize. So maybe the correct command is "unlock door with key". But the door is wooden, so maybe "unlock wooden door with key". However, the game's response after "unlock door" was asking for the tool. So the correct action is to use the key on the door. The user needs to input "use key on wooden door" again, but the game might require the key to be in the inventory. Since the user already took the key from the trunk, it's probably there. Therefore, the next action is "use key on wooden door".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to unlock the wooden door in the bedroom. They found an old key in the antique trunk. But when they try to use the key on the door, the game says "What do you want to unlock wooden door with?" which suggests that the key isn't being recognized as the right item.

Wait, maybe the key isn't in the inventory yet. The user opened the antique trunk and found the key, but maybe they didn't pick it up. So the next step should be to take the key first. Then, use it on the door. Let me check the previous steps again.

The user said "open antique trunk" which worked, then "use key on wooden door" but that didn't work. The game responded with "You can't see any such thing." So maybe the key isn't in the current location. Oh, but the key was in the trunk. Did the user take it? The initial instruction said to recover the old key from the trunk. So maybe the user hasn't picked up the key yet. So the correct action would be to take the key first, then use it on the door.

But the user's last action was "use key on wooden door" which failed. The game says "You can't see any such thing." So maybe the key is still in the trunk. So the user needs to take the key from the trunk first. Then, use it on the door. So the next action should be "take key" or "take old key from antique trunk". But the game might have specific verbs. Let me think about the possible commands. The user might need to take the key first. So the next step is to take the key from the trunk. Then, use it on the door. But the user hasn't taken the key yet. So the correct action is to take the key.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in the TextWorld game. Their goal is to open the antique trunk, get the key, unlock the door, open it, go east, then handle the refrigerator and tomato plant.

So far, they've opened the antique trunk and taken the key. The next step was trying to use the key on the wooden door, but the game didn't recognize the command. Then they tried "unlock door" but got a prompt asking what to unlock it with. Since they have the key, maybe they need to use it on the door.

Wait, the previous attempt was "use key on wooden door", but the game said "That's not a verb I recognise." Maybe the correct command is "unlock wooden door" again, but the game might require using the key first. Alternatively, maybe the key is in the inventory, so they need to use it on the door.

But the user tried "use key on wooden door" and got an error. Then they tried "unlock door" and the game asked what to unlock with. So perhaps the correct command is "unlock wooden door" without specifying the key, but the game expects the key to be used. Alternatively, maybe the key is already in hand, so the correct action is to use it on the door.

Wait, the user just took the key from the trunk, so now they have the key. The next step is to use the key to unlock the door. The correct command might be "use key on wooden door" but the game might not recognize that. Alternatively, maybe "unlock wooden door" is the correct command, and the key is already in hand. But the game said "What do you want to unlock wooden door with?" when the user tried "unlock door".

So perhaps the correct action is to use the key on the door. But the user tried "use key on wooden door" and got an error. Maybe the game expects "unlock wooden door" with the key. Alternatively, maybe the key is in the inventory, so the correct command is "unlock wooden door" and the game will use the key automatically.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "use key on door" but the game doesn't recognize "door" as a noun. The correct command might be "use key on wooden door" but the game's parser is strict.

So, the user should try "use key on wooden door" again, even though the game says it's not a verb. Maybe the game is having a parsing issue. Alternatively, the correct command is "unlock door" and the key is used. But the game's response was "What do you want to unlock wooden door with?" which suggests that the user needs to specify the key.

In this case, the user has the key, so the correct action is to use it on the door. The command should be "use key on wooden door", even if the game says it's not a verb. Maybe the game is expecting that command.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to unlock the wooden door with the key they took from the trunk. Earlier attempts to use the key resulted in errors, like "That's not a verb I recognise" or "You can't see any such thing." But now, after taking the key, they tried "use key on wooden door" again, which still didn't work.

Wait, maybe the correct command is different. In text adventures, sometimes you have to specify the object first. Like "unlock door with key" or "use key to unlock door." But the user has been using "use key on wooden door," which might not be the right syntax. The game might expect "unlock wooden door" followed by using the key, but since the key is already in the inventory, perhaps the correct command is just "unlock door" or "use key on door."

But the user's previous attempt to "unlock door" was rejected because they didn't specify the key. So maybe the correct action is to use the key on the door. However, the system might require the exact phrasing. Let me check the previous interactions. The user tried "use key on wooden door" and got an error. Then they tried "unlock door" and the system asked for the key. So maybe the correct command is "use key on door" without specifying "wooden," or "unlock door with key."

But the user's last action was "use key on wooden door," which the system rejected. The next step would be to try a different phrasing. Maybe "unlock door" without specifying the key, but the system might need the key mentioned. Alternatively, "open door" if that's a valid command. But the user's goal is to unlock it, so "unlock" is the right verb. Since the key is in hand, perhaps the correct command is "unlock door" and the game will accept it if the key is used. But the system might require the key to be specified. Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "use key to unlock door."

But the user has to follow the game's expected syntax. Since the previous attempts to "use key on wooden door" failed, maybe the correct command is "unlock door" and the game will use the key automatically if it's in the inventory. Alternatively, the user might need to say "use key on door" instead of "wooden door." Let me try that. The user's next action should be "use key on door" to see if that works.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to unlock the wooden door with the key they took from the antique trunk. Earlier attempts to use the key on the door didn't work because the correct command structure might be different. The game might expect a specific phrase like "unlock door with key" or "use key on door". But since the user tried "use key on wooden door" and it didn't work, maybe the correct command is just "unlock door" after taking the key. Alternatively, maybe the key is already in hand, so the next step is to use it on the door. The system might be expecting "unlock door" without specifying the key, assuming the key is the right item. Let me check the previous interactions. The user took the key, then tried "use key on wooden door" which was rejected. The system said "That's not a verb I recognise." So maybe the correct command is "unlock door" without the key part. Let me try that.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this TextWorld game. Their goal is to open the antique trunk, get the key, unlock the door, open it, go east, then handle the refrigerator and tomato plant.

So far, they've opened the antique trunk and taken the key. Then they tried to unlock the door but had some issues with the commands. Now, after successfully unlocking the door, the next step is to open it. The user is at the bedroom, having just unlocked the door. The next logical step would be to open the wooden door they just unlocked. The command should be "open wooden door" or maybe "open door". But in the game's context, since the door was unlocked, they need to open it. The previous attempt was to unlock it, which was already done. So the next action is to open the door. The user's last action was unlocking the door, so now they need to open it. The correct command here is "open wooden door".

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps to open the antique trunk, get the key, unlock the wooden door, and open it. They've successfully done all those steps up to this point. Now, the next step in the original goal was to venture east after opening the wooden door. The user just opened the wooden door, so the next logical step would be to move east. The command should be "go east" or "venture east" as per the initial instructions. Since the game's response after opening the door is in the bedroom, moving east would take them to the next room, probably the kitchen where the refrigerator is located. The user needs to proceed to the kitchen, open the refrigerator, get the tomato plant, put it on the stove, and then win. So the correct next action is to go east.

You've entered a kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

Oh, great. Here's a refrigerator. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. The counter is normal. But there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You see a stove. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The stove is standard. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You make out a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Okay, let's see. The user has to follow a series of steps to complete the game. So far, they've opened the antique trunk, taken the key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, and moved east into the kitchen. The next steps according to the original instructions are to ensure the refrigerator is open, retrieve the tomato plant from the refrigerator in the kitchen, place it on the stove, and then win.

In the kitchen, the user now sees a refrigerator, a stove, a kitchen island with a note, and exits in all directions. The refrigerator is mentioned as closed, so the next logical step is to open it. The user's score is at 5/8, so they need to proceed carefully.

The user's last action was "go east," which led them to the kitchen. Now, they need to open the refrigerator. The command should be "open refrigerator." That makes sense because the refrigerator is closed, and the next step in the plan is to open it. After that, they can look for the tomato plant inside. Then, once retrieved, place it on the stove. Since the stove is standard and the user has the tomato plant, that should complete the task. The user needs to make sure each step is followed correctly without errors. The previous attempts with the key were successful, so following the same pattern, opening the refrigerator is the next correct action.

Okay, let's see. The user's goal is to retrieve the tomato plant from the refrigerator in the kitchen and place it on the stove. So far, they've opened the refrigerator and found both the tomato plant and milk. The next step would be to take the tomato plant.

But wait, the user just opened the refrigerator, and the response listed the items inside. The next logical action is to take the tomato plant. The user hasn't taken it yet, so the correct command would be "take tomato plant". Then, after taking it, they need to go to the stove and place it there. But right now, the immediate next step is to take the tomato plant from the refrigerator. The user is in the kitchen, so "take tomato plant" makes sense. Let me check if there are any other steps needed. The original instructions said to take the tomato plant from the refrigerator in the kitchen. So yes, taking it now is the next step.

Okay, the user has to place the tomato plant on the stove in the kitchen. They've already taken the tomato plant from the refrigerator. Now, the next step is to go to the stove and put the plant there. Let me check the current location. The user is in the kitchen, and the stove is mentioned as being in the kitchen. So the action would be to go to the stove and place the tomato plant on it. But the command needs to be in the correct format. The previous action was "take tomato plant", so now they need to "put tomato plant on stove". But the system might require the exact command. Let me make sure.
