Welcome to TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, you could, like, open the chest drawer. Then, pick up the old key from the chest drawer. After picking up the old key, assure that the wooden door is unlocked. Then, ensure that the wooden door is open. After pulling open the wooden door, take a trip east. And then, make sure that the screen door is wide open. After that, make an effort to move east. With that done, attempt to take a trip south. Then, pick-up the bell pepper from the floor of the garden. And then, attempt to go to the north. If you can succeed at that, make an effort to take a trip west. And then, rest the bell pepper on the stove. Got that? Good!

-= Bedroom =-
You are in a bedroom. A standard kind of place.

You can make out a chest drawer. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You see a closed antique trunk close by. Look over there! a king-size bed. The king-size bed appears to be empty.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a TextWorld game and has to follow a series of steps. So far, they've opened the chest drawer and picked up the old key. The next step in the original task was to unlock the wooden door. Since they have the key, they need to use it on the door.

The current location is the bedroom, and there's a closed wooden door leading east. The next logical step would be to unlock the door with the key they just obtained. The user should try to unlock the door first, then open it. So the next action should be to unlock the wooden door. But wait, in TextWorld, the commands might be different. Maybe "unlock the wooden door" or "use key on door". But the user has the key, so the correct command would be to unlock the door with the key. Let me check the previous steps again. The user was told to "assure that the wooden door is unlocked" after picking up the key. So the next action is to unlock the door. The correct command here would be "unlock the wooden door". But I need to make sure that's the right syntax. Alternatively, maybe "use old key on wooden door". But the user has the key, so the game might expect "unlock the wooden door" as the command. Let me go with that.

Okay, the user tried to unlock the wooden door, but it's still fixed. Hmm, maybe the door isn't unlocked yet. Wait, the previous step was unlocking, but the door remains closed. Maybe the key isn't working, or perhaps there's another step needed. Let me check the original task again. After picking up the key, the user needs to ensure the door is unlocked. Maybe the command should be "unlock the wooden door" again, but the game might require a different action. Alternatively, maybe the door is locked with a different mechanism. Wait, the user has the old key, so maybe they need to use it on the door. The correct command might be "use old key on wooden door". Let me try that.

Okay, the user tried "use old key on wooden door" but got an error. Maybe the correct command is just "unlock wooden door" without specifying the key.

Wait, the previous attempt to unlock failed. Maybe the door is locked with a different method. Alternatively, maybe the key is for a different lock.

The kitchen island is usual. On the kitchen island you see a note.

What's that over there? It looks like it's a bbq. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a bbq, go to TextWorld. However, the bbq, like an empty bbq, has nothing on it. You can see a patio table. The patio table is normal. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

Okay, the user is in the garden and needs to pick up the bell pepper. The task says "pick-up the bell pepper from the floor of the garden". The current scene shows a bell pepper on the floor. So the next action is to pick up the bell pepper. The command should be "take bell pepper" or "pick up bell pepper". Let me check the previous steps. The user is supposed to pick it up now. So the correct command is "take bell pepper".

Okay, the user picked up the bell pepper. The next step in the original task was to "attempt to go to the north". So the user needs to try going north from the garden. The command should be "go north". Let me check the current location. The garden has a north exit mentioned. So the next action is to go north.

You've entered a backyard. You can barely contain your excitement.

You scan the room for a set of chairs, and you find a set of chairs! The set of chairs is typical. But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? What's that over there? It looks like it's a bbq. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a bbq, go to TextWorld. However, the bbq, like an empty bbq, has nothing on it. You can see a patio table. The patio table is normal. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

There is an open screen door leading west. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the garden and backyard. They need to follow the original task steps. After picking up the bell pepper, they had to attempt to go north, which led them back to the backyard. Now, they need to go south from the backyard. But the task says after moving east, they should go north. Maybe they need to find another exit. The current location is the backyard with a screen door west and a south exit. The original goal mentions resting the bell pepper on the stove. The stove is in the kitchen. So maybe the user needs to go back to the kitchen, then to the stove. But the current step is to go south from the backyard. Let me check the previous steps. The user is in the backyard, so going south would take them back to the garden. But the garden has the stove? Wait, the kitchen was earlier. Maybe the user needs to go west through the screen door to the kitchen. But the current location is the backyard. The user needs to go west to the kitchen. But the screen door is open. So the next action is to go west. But the task says after going north, attempt to go west. Wait, the original task said after moving east, go north, then west. So maybe the user needs to go west from the backyard. Let me try "go west".

The kitchen island is usual. On the kitchen island you see a note.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

You are in a bathroom. A normal one.

You make out a closed toilet right there by you. You see a bath. You make out a sink. The sink is standard. On the sink you make out a toothbrush.

You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

You arrive in a kitchen. A standard one.

You see a refrigerator. You check the price tag that's still affixed to the refrigerator. 100 bucks? What a deal! You'll have to ask where they got this! You see a counter. The counter is typical. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. Look over there! a kitchen island. You wonder idly who left that here. The kitchen island is usual. On the kitchen island you see a note.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

You are in a bathroom. A normal one.

You make out a closed toilet right there by you. You see a bath. You make out a sink. The sink is standard. On the sink you make out a toothbrush.

You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

You arrive in a kitchen. A standard one.

You see a refrigerator. You check the price tag that's still affixed to the refrigerator. 100 bucks? What a deal! You'll have to ask where they got this! You see a counter. The counter is typical. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. Look over there! a kitchen island. You wonder idly who left that here. The kitchen island is usual. On the kitchen island you see a note.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

You are in a bathroom. A normal one.

You make out a closed toilet right there by you. You see a bath. You make out a sink. The sink is standard. On the sink you make out a toothbrush.

You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

You arrive in a kitchen. A standard one.

You see a refrigerator. You check the price tag that's still affixed to the refrigerator. 100 bucks? What a deal! You'll have to ask where they got this! You see a counter. The counter is typical. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. Look over there! a kitchen island. You wonder idly who left that here. The kitchen island is usual. On the kitchen island you see a note.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

You are in a bathroom. A normal one.

You make out a closed toilet right there by you. You see a bath. You make out a sink. The sink is standard. On the sink you make out a toothbrush.

You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

I need to rest the bell pepper on the stove. The stove is in the kitchen, so I should go south from the bathroom. The command is "go south".

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. A standard one.

You see a refrigerator. You check the price tag that's still affixed to the refrigerator. 100 bucks? What a deal! You'll have to ask where they got this! You see a counter. The counter is typical. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. Look over there! a kitchen island. You wonder idly who left that here. The kitchen island is usual. On the kitchen island you see a note.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.
