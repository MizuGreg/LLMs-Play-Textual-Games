Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an exciting round of TextWorld? You do! Here is how to play! First stop, ensure that the chest drawer within the bedroom is open. And then, pick up the old key from the chest drawer. After that, make absolutely sure that the wooden door is unlocked. Then, ensure that the wooden door is open. After that, venture east. After that, move south. That done, take the bell pepper from the couch in the living room. Then, go north. Then, rest the bell pepper on the stove inside the kitchen. Alright, thanks!

-= Bedroom =-
Well, here we are in the bedroom.

You can make out a chest drawer. You can see a closed antique trunk. You make out a king-size bed. However, the king-size bed, like an empty king-size bed, has nothing on it.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me see. The user is playing this TextWorld game, and they've followed the steps given. The current location is the bedroom. They just opened the chest drawer and found the old key. The next step according to the initial instructions was to pick up the old key from the chest drawer. So after opening it, the next logical action is to take the key.

Wait, the user already did open the chest drawer, and the key is inside. So the next command should be to pick up the key. The response after opening the drawer says the key is there, so the next step is to take it. Then, the user needs to make sure the wooden door is unlocked and opened. But first, the key is in the chest drawer. So the next action is to take the old key. Then, after that, proceed to unlock and open the door. But the user's next input should be the command to pick up the key. So the correct next action is "take old key".

Okay, the user has taken the old key from the chest drawer. The next step according to the initial instructions was to make sure the wooden door is unlocked. So now that the key is picked up, the next action should be to unlock the door. The door is closed and locked, so using the key to unlock it makes sense. The command would be "unlock wooden door".

Wait, but in TextWorld, the commands might be different. Let me check the previous steps. The user was told to "make absolutely sure that the wooden door is unlocked. Then, ensure that the wooden door is open." So first, unlock it, then open it. Since the door is closed, maybe it's locked. So using the key to unlock it. The correct command here would be "unlock wooden door". Then after that, open it. So the next action is to unlock the door with the key. The user has the key now, so that's possible. Therefore, the next command is "unlock wooden door".

I am sorry to announce that you are now in the kitchen.

You see a closed refrigerator right there by you. You scan the room, seeing a counter. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You see a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. You can make out a kitchen island. The kitchen island is standard. On the kitchen island you make out a note. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

Okay, the user is in the kitchen now. The previous steps were moving east from the bedroom, which led here. The next instruction was to move south after venturing east. Wait, let me check the original steps again. The user was told: "venture east. After that, move south. That done, take the bell pepper from the couch in the living room. Then, go north. Then, rest the bell pepper on the stove inside the kitchen."

Wait, after moving east (which took them to the kitchen), the next step is to move south. But the kitchen has an exit to the north, and the west door is open. But the user is in the kitchen, so moving south would take them back to the bedroom? Or maybe another room? Wait, the kitchen's description says there's an exit to the north, which is unguarded. But the user is in the kitchen, and the previous location was the bedroom. So moving south from the kitchen would take them back to the bedroom. But the original steps said after venturing east (from bedroom), move south. But the user is now in the kitchen. So maybe moving south from the kitchen would take them back to the bedroom. But the original plan was to move south after venturing east. But the user is in the kitchen now. So the next step is to move south. But the kitchen's description says there's an exit to the north, and the west door is open. But the user is in the kitchen, so moving south would be towards the bedroom. However, the user's next action should be to move south as per the original instructions. So the command would be "move south". But the user is in the kitchen, and the next step is to move south.

Okay, the user tried to move south from the kitchen but got a response saying they must name something more substantial. Hmm, maybe the command isn't "move south" but something else. Let me think about the possible commands in TextWorld. The user is in the kitchen, which has a west door (open), north exit (unguarded), and maybe other items. The previous steps were going east from the bedroom, then moving south. But the system is prompting for a more specific action. Maybe the user needs to interact with an object instead of just moving. The kitchen has a note on the kitchen island, a refrigerator, a stove, etc. The original goal was to take the bell pepper from the living room, then rest it on the stove. But the user is in the kitchen now. Wait, maybe after moving south, they would return to the bedroom, then go north to the living room to get the bell pepper. But the system is asking for a more substantial command. Maybe the user needs to pick up the note or check the refrigerator? Alternatively, perhaps the correct next step is to go north from the kitchen, as per the original instructions. Wait, the original steps said after moving south, take the bell pepper from the living room, then go north. But the user is in the kitchen. Maybe the user needs to go north from the kitchen to reach the living room. But the kitchen's description says there's an exit to the north. So perhaps the correct command is "go north" instead of "move south". But the user was instructed to move south after venturing east. Wait, maybe the user is confused. Let me recheck the original steps:

Original steps: venture east, then move south. Then take the bell pepper from the couch in the living room. Then go north. Then rest the bell pepper on the stove in the kitchen.

So after moving east (to kitchen), move south (back to bedroom?), then go north to living room. But the user is in the kitchen now. So maybe the next step is to go north from the kitchen. But the system is prompting for a more substantial action. Maybe the user needs to interact with the stove or something else. Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to take the bell pepper from the living room, which is north of the kitchen. So the user needs to go north from the kitchen to the living room. But the system is not allowing "move south" again. Maybe the user needs to go north instead. But the original instruction was to move south after venturing east. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the direction. Let me think again. The user was in the bedroom, went east to the kitchen. Then the next step was to move south. But moving south from the kitchen would take them back to the bedroom. But the original plan was to then go north to the living room. Maybe the user is supposed to go north from the kitchen. But the system is not allowing that. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to take the bell pepper from the living room, which is north of the kitchen. So the correct command is "go north" from the kitchen. But the system is prompting for a more substantial action. Maybe the user needs to interact with the stove or something else. Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to take the note from the kitchen island. But the original goal is to get the bell pepper. Hmm, this is confusing. The system's response says "You must name something more substantial," which might mean the previous command was too generic. So maybe the user needs to specify an object. But the previous command was "move south", which is a valid command. However, the system is rejecting it. Maybe the user needs to use a different verb. Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go north instead. But the original instruction was to move south. I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to think of possible commands in the kitchen. The user can "go north", "go west", "open refrigerator", "pick up note", etc. The original steps said after moving south, take the bell pepper from the living room. So maybe the user needs to go north from the kitchen to the living room. So the next command is "go north".

The original plan was to move south after venturing east, but that led to the kitchen, then moving north to the living room. However, the user's last action was "go north" from the kitchen, which took them to the bathroom. Now, they need to find the right path back. The bathroom has an exit to the south, which would take them back to the kitchen. But the original goal was to get the bell pepper from the living room. Maybe the user needs to go south from the bathroom back to the kitchen, then find another way to the living room. Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the directions. The user might need to check the kitchen's description again. The kitchen had an exit to the north, which was unguarded. Perhaps the user should go north from the kitchen again, but that led to the bathroom. Wait, maybe the user is lost and needs to retrace steps. The next logical action would be to go south from the bathroom back to the kitchen, then try going north again to reach the living room. So the command would be "go south".

A closed toilet is right there by you. Were you looking for a bath? Because look over there, it's a bath. You can see a sink. You shudder, but continue examining the sink. You see a toothbrush on the sink. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it.

There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

I am sorry to announce that you are now in the kitchen.

You see a closed refrigerator right there by you. You scan the room, seeing a counter. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You see a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. You can make out a kitchen island. The kitchen island is standard. On the kitchen island you make out a note. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

You're now in a bathroom.

A closed toilet is right there by you. Were you looking for a bath? Because look over there, it's a bath. You can see a sink. You shudder, but continue examining the sink. You see a toothbrush on the sink. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it.

There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

I am sorry to announce that you are now in the kitchen.

You see a closed refrigerator right there by you. You scan the room, seeing a counter. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You see a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. You can make out a kitchen island. The kitchen island is standard. On the kitchen island you make out a note. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

A closed toilet is right there by you. Were you looking for a bath? Because look over there, it's a bath. You can see a sink. You shudder, but continue examining the sink. You see a toothbrush on the sink. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it.

There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

You're now in a bathroom.

A closed toilet is right there by you. Were you looking for a bath? Because look over there, it's a bath. You can see a sink. You shudder, but continue examining the sink. You see a toothbrush on the sink. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it.

There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

I am sorry to announce that you are now in the kitchen.

You see a closed refrigerator right there by you. You scan the room, seeing a counter. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You see a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. You can make out a kitchen island. The kitchen island is standard. On the kitchen island you make out a note. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing.

Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

-= Kitchen =-
I am sorry to announce that you are now in the kitchen.

You see a closed refrigerator right there by you. You scan the room, seeing a counter. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You see a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. You can make out a kitchen island. The kitchen island is standard. On the kitchen island you make out a note. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Bathroom =-
You're now in a bathroom.

A closed toilet is right there by you. Were you looking for a bath? Because look over there, it's a bath. You can see a sink. You shudder, but continue examining the sink. You see a toothbrush on the sink. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it.

There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.
