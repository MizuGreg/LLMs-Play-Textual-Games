You are now playing a life changing session of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First thing I need you to do is to assure that the chest drawer in the bedroom is open. Then, retrieve the old key from the chest drawer in the bedroom. After that, unlock the wooden door with the old key. And then, ensure that the wooden door in the bedroom is open. After that, make an attempt to move east. Following that, open the refrigerator. And then, pick up the apple from the refrigerator. After that, rest the apple on the stove. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Bedroom =-
You are in a bedroom. A normal one. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You make out a chest drawer. You can make out an antique trunk. You smell a wretched smell, and follow it to a king-size bed. The king-size bed is standard. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me see. The user is playing this TextWorld game, and they've already opened the chest drawer in the bedroom and found the old key. The next steps according to the original task were to unlock the wooden door with the key, ensure the door is open, try to move east, open the refrigerator, pick up the apple, rest it on the stove, and then win.

So after opening the chest drawer, the next logical step would be to use the old key to unlock the wooden door. The user mentioned that the wooden door is closed and leads east. So the next action should be to unlock it. But wait, in TextWorld, sometimes you need to first open the door before you can unlock it, but the user's instruction says to unlock the door with the key. So maybe the correct command is to use the key on the door. But the user's previous action was "open chest drawer", and now the next step is to retrieve the key, which they did. Now they need to unlock the door. The command would be "unlock wooden door with old key" or something similar. But the game might require specific syntax. Let me check the previous commands. The user's first action was "open chest drawer", which worked. Then the next step is to unlock the door. The correct command here would be "unlock wooden door with old key". But maybe the game expects "use old key on wooden door" or "unlock wooden door". Since the key is already retrieved, the next step is to unlock the door. So the next action should be to unlock the wooden door with the old key. Then, after that, ensure the door is open, then move east. So the next command is "unlock wooden door with old key".

Okay, let me figure this out. The user tried to unlock the wooden door with the old key, but the game said they need to take the key first. Wait, but they already retrieved the key from the chest drawer earlier. Let me check the previous steps.

First, the user opened the chest drawer, found the old key. Then, they tried to unlock the door with the key. But the game responded that they need to take the key first. That's confusing because they already took the key from the chest. Maybe the key is still in the chest, and they haven't picked it up yet? Wait, the initial instruction said to "retrieve the old key from the chest drawer in the bedroom." So maybe after opening the chest drawer, they need to pick up the key before using it. The user might have forgotten to pick up the key after opening the drawer. Let me retrace:

1. Open chest drawer → found old key. But did they pick it up? The game's response was "You open the chest drawer, revealing an old key." So the key is in the chest drawer. To use it, they need to take it. So the next step after opening the drawer is to take the key. Then, unlock the door with the key. So the user's mistake was trying to unlock the door before taking the key. So the correct sequence is: open chest drawer, take old key, then unlock door. The user did open the drawer, but didn't take the key. So the next action should be to take the old key from the chest drawer. Then, unlock the door. So the next command is "take old key".

GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

You take the old key from the chest drawer.

Okay, let's see. The user has successfully taken the old key from the chest drawer. Now, the next step according to the original plan is to unlock the wooden door with the old key. So the next action should be to unlock the door. But in TextWorld, the command might be "unlock wooden door with old key" or "use old key on wooden door". Since the user previously tried "unlock wooden door with old key" and it didn't work, but now they have the key, maybe the correct command is "unlock wooden door". Wait, but the game might require specifying the key. Let me check the previous interaction. The user tried "unlock wooden door with old key" and the game said "You need to take the old key first." But after taking the key, the next step is to use it to unlock the door. So the correct command would be "unlock wooden door with old key". But maybe the game expects "use old key on wooden door". However, the user's previous attempt was "unlock wooden door with old key", which failed because the key wasn't taken. Now that the key is taken, that command should work. So the next action is to unlock the door with the key.

Okay, let's see. The user has unlocked the wooden door. Now, the next step according to the original plan is to ensure that the wooden door in the bedroom is open. But wait, the door was already unlocked. Maybe they need to open it. But the door was closed before unlocking. So after unlocking, maybe it's already open. But the game might require explicitly opening it. Alternatively, maybe the door is now open because it's unlocked. The next step after unlocking is to move east, as per the original task. So the user should try to move east. The command would be "go east" or "move east". Let me check the previous steps. The user is in the bedroom, and the door leads east. So after unlocking, they need to open the door and then move east. But the game might require opening the door first. However, once unlocked, it's probably open. So the next action is to move east. So the command is "go east".

Okay, let me figure this out. The user tried to move east after unlocking the door, but the game said they have to open the wooden door first. So even though they unlocked it, maybe the door is still closed and needs to be opened. So the next step is to open the door. The command would be "open wooden door". Let me check the previous steps. The door was locked, then unlocked. Maybe "unlock" just removes the lock, but the door itself is still closed. So opening it is necessary. Therefore, the correct action is to open the wooden door first.

Ah, the kitchen. This is some kind of kitchen, really great standard vibes in this place, a wonderful standard atmosphere. And now, well, you're in it.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a refrigerator. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. The counter appears to be empty. You see a stove. The stove is usual. But there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is standard. On the kitchen island you see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an unguarded exit to the south.
