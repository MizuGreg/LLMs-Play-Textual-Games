I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is how to play! First, it would be great if you could ensure that the chest drawer within the bedroom is open. And then, retrieve the old key from the chest drawer. And then, unlock the wooden door with the old key. And then, ensure that the wooden door within the bedroom is open. And then, make an attempt to go east. And then, open the screen door. After opening the screen door, make an effort to go to the east. Then, take a trip south. And then, retrieve the bell pepper from the floor of the garden. If you can get your hands on the bell pepper, head north. Then, travel west. After that, rest the bell pepper on the stove. Got that? Good!

-= Bedroom =-
You're now in the bedroom. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You can make out a chest drawer. You can see a closed antique trunk. You make out a king-size bed. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Hm. Oh well

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

<think>
Okay, let me see. The user is in a text-based game called TextWorld. Their goal is to follow a series of steps to reach the original goal, which I assume is to get the bell pepper and maybe escape or complete some task.

So far, they've opened the chest drawer in the bedroom and found an old key. The next step according to the initial instructions was to unlock the wooden door with the old key. The user hasn't done that yet. The current location is the bedroom, and the wooden door leading east is closed. 

The user's next action should be to use the old key to unlock the door. The command would be "unlock wooden door with old key". But in TextWorld, the syntax might be different. Maybe "use old key on wooden door" or "unlock wooden door". Since the key is in the chest drawer, they have it now. So the correct command is likely "unlock wooden door".

Wait, the user just opened the chest drawer and got the key. The next step in the original instructions was to unlock the wooden door with the old key. So the next action is to unlock the door. The user is in the bedroom, and the door is closed. So the command should be "unlock wooden door". Let me check the previous messages. The user was told to "unlock the wooden door with the old key". So the correct action is to use the key to unlock the door. The command would be "unlock wooden door" assuming the key is already in hand. So the next action is "unlock wooden door".

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps to open the chest drawer, get the old key, and try to unlock the wooden door. But the door is fixed. So the next step would be to check if the key is the right one. Maybe the door is locked, so using the key to unlock it.

Wait, the previous action was unlocking the wooden door, but the door was fixed. Maybe the key isn't working yet. Or maybe the door is locked, and the key is needed. Since the user has the key, maybe they need to try using it again. Alternatively, maybe the door is locked from the inside, so they need to find another way. But according to the instructions, after getting the key, they should unlock the door. So the next step is to try using the key on the door. But the user tried unlocking it, and it was fixed. Maybe the key is not the right one, but the user has the old key from the chest. Hmm. Maybe the door is locked, and the key is needed. So the next action should be to try using the key again. But the system message says to only output the action. So the next action is to unlock the door with the key. But the door was fixed. Wait, maybe the user needs to try using the key again. So the next action is to unlock the wooden door with the key. But the previous action was unlocking, which didn't work. Maybe the key is not the right one, but the user has to try again. Alternatively, maybe the door is locked, and the key is needed. So the next action is to unlock the door with the key. So the answer is "unlock wooden door".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to progress through the game by following a series of steps. So far, they've opened the chest drawer and retrieved the old key. Then they tried to unlock the wooden door, but it's fixed in place. The next step in their plan was to ensure the wooden door is open, but they tried unlocking it again and it didn't work.

Hmm, maybe the wooden door can't be unlocked with the key they have. Wait, the key was from the chest drawer, which was in the bedroom. The wooden door is also in the bedroom. If the door is fixed, perhaps the key doesn't work here. Maybe they need to find another way to open it. Alternatively, maybe the key is for a different lock.

Looking back at the initial instructions, after getting the key, they needed to unlock the wooden door. But since it's fixed, maybe they need to try a different approach. Maybe the door has a handle or a mechanism that can be turned, or perhaps there's another object that needs to be interacted with first. Alternatively, maybe the key is for a different door, and the wooden door requires something else.

Wait, the user's next step after unlocking the door failed. So perhaps they need to check if the key is the right one. Or maybe the door is locked from the outside, and they need to find a way to open it from the inside. But since they're in the bedroom, maybe they need to look for a different method. Alternatively, maybe the door is jammed and needs to be pushed or pulled.

Alternatively, maybe the key is for a different lock, like the antique trunk. But the trunk was closed, and the key was retrieved from the chest drawer. Wait, the chest drawer was opened, and the key was inside. So maybe the key is for the trunk, but the user tried to use it on the door. That might not be the right approach.

So the next action should be to check the antique trunk. Maybe the key is for the trunk, and once it's opened, there might be something else inside that can help with the door. Alternatively, maybe the trunk is the source of the key, but the user already got the key from the chest drawer. Wait, the chest drawer was part of the bedroom, and the trunk is also in the bedroom. Maybe the trunk is locked, and the key can be used on it. But the user hasn't tried that yet.

So the next step might be to open the antique trunk with the key. That could be the correct action here. Because the key was retrieved from the chest drawer, and the trunk is in the same room. So the user should try using the key on the trunk. That makes sense. So the next command should be to unlock the antique trunk.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to progress through the game by following a series of steps. So far, they've opened the chest drawer and retrieved the old key. Then they tried to unlock the wooden door, but it was fixed. They tried unlocking the antique trunk, but that's also fixed.

Hmm, the original goal mentioned was to get the bell pepper from the garden and then do some actions. But the current location is the bedroom. The user might be stuck because the wooden door isn't opening with the key. Maybe they need to find another way to open the door or check if the key works. Alternatively, maybe there's another object in the bedroom they can interact with.

Wait, the user's next action was to try unlocking the antique trunk, but it's fixed. Maybe the key isn't working there. The wooden door was already mentioned as closed, but the user tried to unlock it. Maybe the key is for the door, but the door is locked. But the user tried to unlock it and it didn't work. Maybe they need to find another way to open the door, like using a different object or finding a way to open it without the key.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go through the door, but it's blocked. The next step might be to try using the key on the door again, but the system says the door is fixed. Maybe the key isn't the right one, or the door is locked with a different mechanism. Or perhaps the user needs to find another way to open the door, like looking for a handle or a lever.

Wait, the user's previous actions were to open the chest drawer, get the key, try to unlock the door, which didn't work. Then tried the trunk, which is fixed. So maybe the key isn't working on the door. Maybe the door has a different lock. Or maybe the user needs to find another key. Alternatively, maybe the door can be opened by another method, like pushing or pulling.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check the room for other objects. The bedroom has a chest drawer, an antique trunk, a bed, and a closed wooden door. The user might need to look for a way to open the door without the key. But the original instructions said to unlock the door with the old key. So maybe the key is the right one, but the door is fixed. Maybe the user needs to try using the key again, or maybe there's a different action needed.

Wait, the user's next action after trying to unlock the trunk was to try using the key on the door again. But the door is fixed. Maybe the user needs to try another action, like going east through the door, but it's closed. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to find a way to open the door, like looking for a handle or a switch.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check the other objects in the room. The chest drawer is open, but the trunk is closed. Maybe the trunk has something inside that can help. But the trunk is fixed, so maybe the user needs to find a way to open it. But the user tried that already.

Hmm, the user's next action should be to try using the key on the door again, but the system says the door is fixed. Maybe the key isn't working, so the user needs to find another way. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to look for another object to open the door. But according to the original plan, the key should unlock the door. Maybe the user needs to try using the key again, even though it's fixed. Or perhaps the user needs to find a way to open the door without the key.

Wait, the user's previous action was to unlock the wooden door, which didn't work. The next step might be to try using the key again. But the system says the door is fixed. Maybe the user needs to try a different action, like trying to push the door. But the instructions said to unlock it with the key. Maybe the user is stuck here and needs to find another way. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check if the key is the right one. But the key was retrieved from the chest drawer, so that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go through the door even if it's closed, but that's not possible. So the next action should be to try using the key again on the door. But the system says the door is fixed. Maybe the user needs to try another action, like looking for a way to open the door. But the instructions say to unlock it with the key. So perhaps the user is stuck here and needs to proceed to the next step, which is to open the screen door. But the user hasn't done that yet. Wait, the original plan was to go east after unlocking the door, then open the screen door, then go east again, etc. But the door isn't opening. Maybe the user needs to find another way to proceed.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check if the key is in the right place. But the key was retrieved from the chest drawer. Maybe the key is for the trunk, not the door. But the original plan was to use the key to unlock the door. So perhaps the user needs to try using the key on the door again. But the door is fixed. Maybe the user needs to try a different action, like trying to open the door with the key, even if it's fixed. Or maybe the user needs to look for another way to open the door.

In this case, the next action should be to try using the key on the door again, even though it's fixed. But according to the system's response, the door is fixed. So maybe the user needs to try another action, like looking for a way to open the door. But the user's next action should be to try using the key again. However, the system says the door is fixed. Maybe the user needs to try a different approach. But the instructions say to unlock the door with the key. So the user might be stuck here and need to proceed to the next step, which is to open the screen door. But the screen door is in another location. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check the other objects in the room.

Wait, the user is in the bedroom, and the next step after unlocking the door would be to go east. But the door is fixed. So maybe the user needs to find another way to proceed. But according to the original plan, the user needs to unlock the door first. Since that's not working, maybe the user needs to look for another object. The antique trunk is closed, but maybe it's possible to open it. The user tried that, but it's fixed. Maybe the user needs to try another action, like looking for a way to open the trunk. But the user's next action should be to try opening the trunk again. However, the user already tried that.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check the bed for something. But the bed is empty. So the user is stuck. The next action should be to try using the key on the door again, even though it's fixed. But the system says the door is fixed. Maybe the user needs to proceed to the next step, which is to open the screen door. But the screen door is in another room. So maybe the user needs to find a way to open the door. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check if the key is the right one. But the key was retrieved from the chest drawer, so that's correct.

In conclusion, the next action should be to try using the key on the door again, even though it's fixed. But the system says the door is fixed. So perhaps the user is stuck here and needs to find another way. However, the original plan was to unlock the door with the key. So the user might need to proceed to the next step, which is to open the screen door. But the screen door is in another location. Therefore, the user needs to find a way to open the door. But since the door is fixed, maybe the user needs to try a different action. However, the user's next action should be to try using the key again on the door. But the system says the door is fixed. Therefore, the user is stuck. But according to the instructions, the user needs to proceed to the next step. So maybe the user should try to go east through the door, even if it's closed. But that's not possible. Therefore, the next action should be to try using the key again on the door.

Hmm, the original goal was to retrieve the bell pepper from the garden and then do some actions. But so far, the user has only managed to get the key from the chest drawer. The wooden door is closed, so maybe they need to find another way to open it. Wait, the user mentioned "ensure that the wooden door within the bedroom is open" after unlocking it with the key.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check other objects in the bedroom. The antique trunk is closed, but maybe it's locked. The user tried to unlock it, but it's fixed. Maybe the key is needed for the trunk instead? But the key was taken from the chest drawer. Wait, the user has the key, but the door is fixed.

But the trunk is fixed. So the next action is to try using the key on the door again. But the door is fixed. So the user might be stuck. But the user's next action should be to try using the key on the door again. So the answer is to try unlocking the door again with the key.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to progress through the game by following a series of steps. They started by opening the chest drawer and finding an old key. Then they tried to unlock the wooden door, but it was fixed. They also tried unlocking the antique trunk, which wasn't possible. The screen door wasn't there, so that attempt failed. Now, after several failed attempts to unlock the wooden door, the user is stuck again.

The original goal was to retrieve the bell pepper from the garden and then rest it on the stove. But the current location is the bedroom. The user needs to move east after opening the screen door, but that's not possible yet. Maybe they need to find another way to open the door or find a different path. Since the wooden door is fixed, perhaps there's another method to get through, like using the key they found. But the key might not work if the door is locked. Alternatively, maybe there's a different object in the bedroom that can be used to open the door. The antique trunk is fixed, so maybe it's not helpful. The user might need to check if the key can be used on another lock. But in the current state, the wooden door is fixed, so maybe the key isn't the right one. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to find another way to open the door, like finding a tool or a different method. Since the user is stuck, the next action should be to try using the key on the door again, even though it's fixed, or look for another object that can help. But the user has already tried unlocking the door multiple times. Maybe the next step is to check the bed or the chest drawer again for something else. However, the user's previous actions have not yielded results. So, perhaps the correct next step is to try using the key on the wooden door again, even though it's fixed, or maybe look for another way to open the door. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to find a way to open the screen door first, but that wasn't possible. The user might need to check if there's a way to open the door without the key, but the game might require the key. Since the key is in the chest drawer, and the user has already retrieved it, the next logical step is to try using it on the door again. But the door is fixed, so maybe the key isn't the right one. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to find another way to proceed. However, the user's instructions mention that after unlocking the door, they should go east, but that's not possible yet. So the next action should be to try using the key on the door again, even though it's fixed, or look for another object. But the user has already tried that. Maybe the correct next step is to go east despite the door being fixed, but that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check the bed for something. But the bed is empty. The only other object is the antique trunk, which is fixed. So perhaps the user needs to find another way. But according to the game's instructions, after getting the key, they should unlock the door. Since the door is fixed, maybe the key isn't the right one, or the user needs to use it in a different way. But the user has already tried that. Maybe the next step is to try opening the screen door again, but that wasn't possible. The user might need to find another way. However, the user's previous actions have not worked, so perhaps the next step is to try using the key on the door again, even though it's fixed. So the answer is to unlock the wooden door again.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to progress through the game by following a series of steps. They started by opening the chest drawer and finding an old key. Then they tried to unlock the wooden door, but it's fixed in place. They've tried unlocking it multiple times, which isn't working. Then they tried opening the screen door, but that doesn't exist. Now they're trying to unlock the wooden door again, but it's still not opening.

Hmm, maybe the key they found is needed to unlock the door. But the door is fixed, so perhaps they need to find another way. Wait, the original goal was to retrieve the bell pepper from the garden and then do some actions. But they're stuck in the bedroom. Maybe they need to find another way to open the door or find a different path. Alternatively, maybe the screen door is a red herring, or perhaps there's a different object they need to interact with. Since the wooden door isn't opening, maybe they need to look for a different method. But the user is following the initial instructions, which might have a specific sequence. They might need to check if the key is already in their inventory and try using it on the door. But the game's response says the door is fixed, so maybe the key isn't the right item. Alternatively, maybe they need to open the trunk first, but the trunk is fixed. Wait, the user tried unlocking the trunk but it's fixed. So perhaps the key isn't working on the trunk. Maybe the key is for a different lock. But the door is fixed, so maybe they need to find another way to open it. Alternatively, maybe the screen door is part of the solution, but the user can't see it. The user might need to check the room again for other objects. The initial steps mentioned opening the screen door after the wooden door, but that's not possible. Maybe the user is missing something. Alternatively, the game might have a different logic. Since the user is stuck, maybe the next step is to check the bed or the chest drawer again. But the original plan was to go east after opening the door.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to unlock the wooden door with the old key. They tried "unlock wooden door" multiple times, but it didn't work. Then they tried "use old key on wooden door", which the system rejected.

Hmm, maybe the correct action is to "use the old key on the wooden door". Wait, but the system said "That's not a verb I recognise." So perhaps the command needs to be more specific. Maybe "unlock the wooden door with the old key"? But the user is supposed to only output the action, not the entire sentence.

Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "open wooden door" or "unlock wooden door". But earlier attempts to unlock failed. Wait, the key was retrieved from the chest drawer. Maybe the door can't be unlocked unless the key is used properly. The system might expect the exact phrase "use old key on wooden door", but the user tried that and it didn't work. Or maybe the correct verb is "unlock" with the key specified. But the system said "use old key on wooden door" was invalid.

Wait, maybe the correct action is "unlock wooden door" but the key isn't being used. The user has the key, so maybe the command should include using the key. But the system didn't accept "use old key on wooden door". Maybe the correct command is "unlock the wooden door with the old key"? But the user is supposed to only output the action. Alternatively, maybe "use key on door" but the key is called "old key".

Alternatively, maybe the system expects "open wooden door" even though it's locked. But the door is fixed in place. So the correct action is to use the key to unlock it. But the system didn't accept "use old key on wooden door". Maybe the correct command is "unlock wooden door" and the key is already in the inventory. But the system said the door is fixed. Maybe the key isn't being used correctly. Wait, the user has the old key from the chest drawer. So the correct action is to use the key on the door. But the system didn't accept that. Maybe the correct command is "use old key on wooden door" but the system is case-sensitive. Maybe it's "use old key on the wooden door". But the user is supposed to only output the action. Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "unlock wooden door" and the key is already in hand. But the door is fixed. Maybe the user needs to try again. But the system is not accepting the use of the key. Maybe the correct action is "open wooden door" but that's not working. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "push wooden door" but that's not the case. I think the correct action is to use the key on the door, so "use old key on wooden door" even though the system rejected it. But the user is supposed to follow the system's commands. Maybe the correct action is "unlock wooden door" again. But the door is fixed. Maybe the user needs to try a different approach. But the system is not accepting the use of the key. Maybe the answer is "use old key on wooden door" even though it was rejected. But the user is supposed to only output the action. So the next action should be "use old key on wooden door".

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to use the old key on the wooden door. The previous attempt to "use old key on wooden door" resulted in an error because the system doesn't recognize that verb. So, I need to figure out the correct command.

In TextWorld games, actions are usually verbs that match the objects. The key is already retrieved from the chest drawer. The wooden door is closed, so the correct action would be to "unlock" the door with the key. But the user tried "unlock wooden door" before, and it didn't work. Wait, maybe the key is needed as an argument. So instead of just "unlock wooden door", it should be "unlock wooden door with old key" or similar.

But the system might expect a specific verb. Let me check the previous interactions. The user tried "unlock wooden door" and got "The wooden door is fixed in place." So maybe the correct verb is "open" instead of "unlock"? But the door is wooden, so maybe "unlock" is the right verb. However, the system might require specifying the key. Alternatively, maybe "use" is the correct verb here. But the user tried "use old key on wooden door" and got an error.

Wait, the error message says "That's not a verb I recognise." So the command "use old key on wooden door" is invalid. The correct verb might be "unlock" with the key as an object. So the correct command should be "unlock wooden door with old key". But the system might not accept that. Alternatively, maybe "open wooden door with old key".

Alternatively, maybe the key is already in the inventory, so the correct command is just "unlock wooden door". But the user tried that before and it didn't work. Hmm.

Wait, the initial instruction was to "unlock the wooden door with the old key". So the correct action is to use the key to unlock the door. The correct command might be "unlock wooden door" if the key is in the inventory. But the system says the door is fixed, so maybe the key isn't being used properly. Alternatively, maybe the correct verb is "open" instead of "unlock".

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "use" the key on the door. But the system didn't accept "use old key on wooden door". Maybe the correct command is "use old key on wooden door" but with a different phrasing. Or perhaps the system expects "unlock" as the verb, and the key is already in hand, so just "unlock wooden door".

But the user tried that before and it didn't work. Maybe the door is not unlockable with the key, but the key is for something else. Wait, the original goal was to retrieve the bell pepper and then go south, etc. Maybe the user is stuck on the door. Alternatively, maybe the correct action is to "open" the door instead of "unlock".

So, considering all that, the next action should be "open wooden door" or "unlock wooden door with old key". But the system might require "unlock" without the key, but that didn't work. Alternatively, maybe the key is needed as an argument. Let me check the possible commands again.

In TextWorld, the correct syntax for using an object is usually "verb object". So if the key is needed to unlock the door, the command would be "unlock wooden door with old key". But the system might not accept that. Alternatively, maybe "use old key on wooden door".

But the user tried "use old key on wooden door" and got an error. So perhaps the correct command is "unlock wooden door" even though the door is fixed. Wait, but the door is fixed, so maybe the key isn't working. Maybe the user needs to find another way. Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to "open" the door instead of "unlock".

Alternatively, maybe the correct action is to "open screen door" but the user tried that and it didn't work. The user's next action after that was "unlock wooden door", which didn't work. So maybe the correct action is "open wooden door".

But the system says the door is fixed. Maybe the key is not the right object. Wait, the key is from the chest drawer, so it should work. Maybe the correct command is "unlock wooden door with old key".

But the system might not accept that. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "use" the key on the door. But the previous attempt failed. Maybe the correct command is "use old key on wooden door".

Wait, the user tried that and got an error. So maybe the correct verb is "open" instead of "use" or "unlock". Let me think again. The user's goal is to unlock the door with the key. So the correct command is "unlock wooden door with old key".

But the system might not accept that. Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "open wooden door with old key". But the system might not recognize that either.

Alternatively, maybe the user should try "open wooden door" without the key. But the door is fixed, so that's not possible. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to "use" the key on the door. But the system says that's not a recognized verb. So maybe the correct command is "unlock wooden door".

But the user tried that before and it didn't work. So maybe the key isn't in the inventory. Wait, the user retrieved the key from the chest drawer. So it should be in the inventory.

This is confusing. The user needs to find the correct command to unlock the door with the key. The previous attempts didn't work. Maybe the correct command is "unlock wooden door" even though it's fixed. But the system says the door is fixed. Maybe the key is not the right object. Or maybe the user needs to "open" the door with the key.

Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "open wooden door with old key".

But the system might not accept that. Given that the user is stuck, the next action should be to try "open wooden door with old key".

Then they tried "open wooden door with old key" and the response was "You need to take the old key first." So the problem is that the old key is still in the chest drawer, right?

Wait, the user had opened the chest drawer earlier and retrieved the old key. But maybe they didn't pick it up yet. The game might require holding the key to use it. So the next step should be to take the old key from the chest drawer. But wait, the chest drawer was already opened. Let me check the previous steps.

In the initial steps, the user opened the chest drawer and found the old key. But maybe the key is still in the chest drawer and needs to be picked up. So the correct action would be to take the old key from the chest drawer. Then, after taking it, they can try opening the door with it. So the next command should be "take old key from chest drawer" or something similar.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game called TextWorld. Their goal is to follow a series of steps to reach the original goal, which from the initial instructions seems to involve navigating through different rooms, retrieving items, and possibly escaping or completing a quest.

Looking at the current state: The user has just unlocked the wooden door in the bedroom. The next step in the original plan was to "make an attempt to go east" after unlocking the door. But in the previous steps, the user tried to unlock the door multiple times, which wasn't working until they used the old key. Now that the door is unlocked, the next logical step would be to go through the door eastward.

However, the user's last action was "unlock wooden door," which succeeded. The next command should be to "go east" to move into the next room. The user's previous attempts to go east might have failed because the door was locked, but now it's unlocked. So the correct action here is to go east. The user needs to type "go east" to proceed. The assistant should only output the command, no explanations. So the next action is "go east."

Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game called TextWorld. The goal is to follow a series of steps to complete tasks, like opening drawers, retrieving items, unlocking doors, and moving directions.

Looking at the current state, the user has already opened the chest drawer and retrieved the old key. They tried to unlock the wooden door but it was fixed. Then they tried using the key, but the game didn't recognize the command. After taking the key from the chest, they tried unlocking the door again, which worked. Now, they tried to go east, but the game said they need to open the wooden door first.

So the next logical step is to open the wooden door again. The user has the key, so they should use it to unlock the door. The previous attempt to unlock the door was successful, but maybe the door wasn't fully open. The game might require the door to be open before moving east. Therefore, the correct action is to open the wooden door again to proceed.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in the TextWorld game. They started by opening the chest drawer, finding the old key, and then trying to unlock the wooden door. But the door was fixed until they actually used the key. Then they managed to open the door and go east.

Now, the next step in their plan was to open the screen door, but the game didn't recognize that. So they tried going east again, but the door was still closed. Then they opened the door, and now they're in a new location.

The user's next action should be to go east again, as per the original plan. But since they just opened the wooden door, they can now move east. The screen door might be in the next room, so after going east, they can try opening it. But the user hasn't mentioned the screen door yet. Wait, the original instructions said after opening the wooden door, they should attempt to go east, then open the screen door, then go east again, then south, etc.

So after opening the wooden door and moving east, they should check if there's a screen door to open. But the user's last action was opening the wooden door, so the next step is to go east. Let me check the previous steps again.

The user just opened the wooden door, so they can now go east. The next step in the plan was to go east after opening the screen door, but maybe the screen door is in the next room. Wait, the original plan was: after opening the wooden door, make an attempt to go east. Then, open the screen door. Then go east again. Then take a trip south. Then retrieve the bell pepper, etc.

So after opening the wooden door, the user should try going east. The game might have a screen door in that direction. So the correct next action is to go east.

You've just sauntered into a kitchen.

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a refrigerator. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a counter. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. You make out a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. The stove is ordinary. The stove appears to be empty. You can see a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps to open the wooden door in the bedroom, retrieve the old key, and then use it to unlock the door. They managed to get the key and unlock the door, then open it and go east into the kitchen. Now, the next step according to the original plan was to open the screen door, then go east again, then take a trip south, retrieve the bell pepper, and so on.

But in the current scenario, the user is in the kitchen. The kitchen has a screen door leading east, which was mentioned earlier. The user's last action was "go east" which led them to the kitchen. Now, the next step in the original plan was to open the screen door. However, in the kitchen, the screen door is closed. So the user needs to open it first. Then, after opening it, they can go east again. But the user has to check if the screen door is indeed closed here. The current description says there's a closed screen door leading east. So the next action should be to open the screen door. Then, after that, go east again. But the user might have to make sure they're doing the right steps. Also, the user's score is increasing, so they're on the right track. The original goal was to retrieve the bell pepper from the garden, so after moving through the kitchen, they might need to go south to reach the garden. But the current step is to open the screen door in the kitchen. So the next command should be "open screen door".

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Kitchen now. They just opened the screen door. The next step according to the original plan was to go east after opening the screen door. So, the next action should be "go east". But I need to check if there's any other task mentioned.

Wait, the original instructions said after opening the screen door, make an effort to go to the east. Then take a trip south. So after opening the screen door, the next step is to go east. The user is in the Kitchen, and the screen door is east. So after opening it, they should go east. Then, after that, go south. But the current location is the Kitchen. The user just opened the screen door, so the next command should be "go east". Let me confirm the environment description. The Kitchen has a closed screen door leading east and an open wooden door west. So going east would be through the screen door. The user is in the Kitchen, so "go east" is the correct next step.

-= Backyard =-
If you're wondering why everything seems so ordinary all of a sudden, it's because you've just walked into the backyard. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You can see a set of chairs. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a set of chairs, go to TextWorld. The set of chairs is usual. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You see a bbq. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You swear loudly. You can see a patio table. Now why would someone leave that there? But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.

There is an open screen door leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Backyard, and the next step according to the original plan was to go south after opening the screen door. But the user just came from the Kitchen, opened the screen door, and now is in the Backyard. The original goal was to retrieve the bell pepper from the garden, then go north, west, and put it on the stove.

Wait, the current location is the Backyard. The user needs to go south from here. The Backyard has an exit to the south. So the next action should be to go south. But let me check the environment again. The Backyard's description says there's an unblocked exit to the south. So the correct command is "go south". The user's previous action was "go east" from the Kitchen, which led to the Backyard. Now, from the Backyard, the next step is to go south to reach the garden where the bell pepper is. So the next action should be "go south".

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps to complete the game. They started in the bedroom, opened the chest drawer, got the old key, unlocked the door, and moved to the kitchen and backyard. Now they're in the garden, where they took the bell pepper.

The next step according to the original plan was to head north after taking the bell pepper. The user's last action was taking the bell pepper, so the next command should be "go north". Then, after moving north, they need to travel west and rest the bell pepper on the stove. But the current location is the garden, so after taking the bell pepper, the immediate next step is to go north. The user hasn't done that yet. So the correct action here is "go north".

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Backyard again after going north from the Garden. The original goal was to retrieve the bell pepper and then rest it on the stove. Wait, but the user already took the bell pepper from the garden and went back to the backyard. Now they need to go west through the screen door to get back to the kitchen or maybe the bedroom? But the next step is to rest the bell pepper on the stove. The stove is in the kitchen. So the user needs to go back to the kitchen, find the stove, and put the bell pepper there.

But the current location is the Backyard. The available exits are west (screen door) and south. Going west would lead back to the Kitchen, right? Because earlier, when they were in the Kitchen, the screen door was east, and the Backyard's screen door is west. So going west from Backyard would take them back to the Kitchen. Then, from the Kitchen, they can go north to the Bedroom or other areas. But the stove is in the Kitchen. So the plan is: go west to Kitchen, then go north to Bedroom? Wait, no, the stove is in the Kitchen. So after going west to Kitchen, they can go to the stove and put the bell pepper there. But the user is holding the bell pepper. So the next steps would be: go west to Kitchen, then go to the stove, then put the bell pepper on it. But the user is currently in the Backyard. So the immediate next action is to go west to the Kitchen. Then, in the Kitchen, they can go to the stove and put the bell pepper there. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the correct next action is to go west to the Kitchen.

Okay, let's see. The user has been navigating through different rooms in TextWorld, trying to complete a series of tasks. The original goal mentioned was to retrieve the bell pepper from the garden, rest it on the stove, and probably other steps along the way. 

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Kitchen again after going west from the Backyard. The score is at 9/20. The previous steps included opening doors, unlocking items, taking the bell pepper, and moving around. Now, the user needs to figure out the next action.

In the Kitchen, the possible exits are east (screen door), west (wooden door), north, and south. The user has already opened the screen door earlier and went east to the Backyard. Now, they might need to check the kitchen island where a note was mentioned. But the main task was to rest the bell pepper on the stove. Wait, the bell pepper was taken from the Garden and the user is now in the Kitchen. The stove is in the Kitchen, so the next logical step would be to put the bell pepper on the stove.

But the user hasn't done that yet. The last action was going west to the Kitchen. So the next step should be to go north to the bedroom? Wait, no. The user needs to rest the bell pepper on the stove in the Kitchen. So the current location is the Kitchen, and the user has the bell pepper. Therefore, the next action should be to put the bell pepper on the stove. However, the available commands are to move directions or interact with objects. The stove is an object here. So the correct command would be to put the bell pepper on the stove. But the system might require the exact command. Let me check the previous interactions.

In the Garden, the user took the bell pepper. Then went north to Backyard, then west to Kitchen. Now, in the Kitchen, the stove is present. So the next action is to put the bell pepper on the stove. The command would be "put bell pepper on stove". But the user's previous actions were moving, so maybe the system expects "put" as a verb. However, in TextWorld, sometimes you have to use specific commands. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go to the stove first. But the stove is already in the room. So the correct action is to put the bell pepper on the stove. Therefore, the next command should be "put bell pepper on stove".
