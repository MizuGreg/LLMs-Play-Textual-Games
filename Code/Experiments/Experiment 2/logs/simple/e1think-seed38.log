Welcome to TextWorld! First off, ensure that the antique trunk within the bedroom is open. After pulling open the antique trunk, recover the old key from the antique trunk within the bedroom. Then, insert the old key into the wooden door's lock to unlock it. And then, ensure that the wooden door is open. And then, make an effort to head east. After that, doublecheck that the screen door is wide open. After that, go to the east. And then, make an attempt to take a trip south. Following that, lift the milk from the floor of the garden. If you have picked up the milk, venture north. And then, go west. And then, sit the milk on the stove. Got that? Good!

-= Bedroom =-
You find yourself in a bedroom. The room is well lit.

You can make out a chest drawer. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an antique trunk. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a king-size bed. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Hm. Oh well

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me see. The user is in a text-based game called TextWorld. Their current location is the bedroom, and they've just opened the antique trunk, which gave them an old key. The next steps according to the initial instructions were to use the key to unlock the wooden door east of the bedroom, then go east, check the screen door, go south, pick up milk, etc.

So, the next logical step after getting the key is to insert it into the lock of the wooden door. The user has to unlock the door. The current state is that the wooden door is closed. The user needs to open it. The previous action was opening the trunk, so the next action should be using the key on the door. The command would be "use old key on wooden door" or something similar. But in the game's context, maybe the exact command is "unlock wooden door" or "open wooden door". However, since the key is needed, the correct action is to insert the key into the lock and turn it. But the game might require a specific command like "use key on door" or "unlock door".

Looking at the initial instructions, the user was told to "insert the old key into the wooden door's lock to unlock it". So the next action should be inserting the key into the lock. The correct command here would be "insert old key into wooden door's lock" or "use old key on wooden door". But the game's commands might be more straightforward. Since the user has the key, they need to unlock the door. The possible command is "unlock wooden door" but that might not work without the key. Alternatively, "open wooden door" might require the key. So the correct action is to use the key on the door. The exact command might be "use old key on wooden door" or "unlock wooden door with old key". However, the game's previous actions used "open antique trunk", so maybe the command here is "unlock wooden door".

But the user has to insert the key into the lock. So the correct command is "insert old key into wooden door's lock". However, the game might have a specific syntax. Let me check the previous steps. The user was told to "insert the old key into the wooden door's lock to unlock it". So the next action is to do that. Therefore, the correct command is "insert old key into wooden door's lock". But the game might require a different phrasing. Alternatively, "use old key on wooden door". But the user has to make sure the key is in the lock. So the next action is to use the key on the door. The correct command is "use old key on wooden door". But in the game's context, maybe "unlock wooden door" is the command. However, since the key is needed, the user must first insert it. Therefore, the correct action is "insert old key into wooden door's lock".

Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they need to follow specific steps to progress. The current scenario is in the bedroom. They've already opened the antique trunk and taken the old key. The next step was to insert the key into the wooden door's lock to unlock it. The user tried that, but the response indicates that the wooden door is still closed. So, the next logical step would be to try to open the door after inserting the key. The user might need to try unlocking the door again or check if the key is properly inserted. Since the previous action was inserting the key, the next action should be to attempt to open the door. The correct command here would be to "open wooden door" or "unlock wooden door". But according to the game's commands, it's likely "open wooden door" is the right action.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing a text adventure game. The goal seems to be to follow a series of steps to reach a certain outcome, probably escaping or completing a quest.

First, the user was in the bedroom. They opened the antique trunk and found an old key. Then they tried to insert the key into the wooden door's lock. But the game responded that they need to unlock the door first. So the correct action here is to use the key to unlock the door, not just insert it. The user tried to open the door, but that's not the right step. The next logical step is to use the key on the lock to unlock it. Once the door is unlocked, they can open it. Then, they need to go east, check the screen door, and proceed further. The user is close but needs to correctly use the key to unlock the door before opening it. So the next action should be to unlock the wooden door with the old key.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the steps in the TextWorld game. The initial instructions were to open the antique trunk, get the old key, unlock the wooden door, open it, go east, check the screen door, etc.

So far, the user tried opening the trunk, which worked. Then they tried inserting the key into the door's lock, but the game said they needed to take the key first. Then they tried unlocking the door with the old key, but the game said they needed to take the key first again. Wait, maybe the user didn't pick up the key after taking it from the trunk.

Wait, the first step was to open the antique trunk, which was done. Then the game said the old key was recovered. So the user has the key. Then the next step was to insert the key into the lock. But the game said they needed to take the key first. That might mean that the user didn't actually pick up the key yet. Wait, no, the trunk was opened, and the key was recovered. So maybe the user didn't take the key from the trunk. Oh, right, the instruction says "recover the old key from the antique trunk". So maybe the user just opened the trunk but didn't take the key. So the next step should be to take the key from the trunk.

But in the previous step, the user tried inserting the key into the lock, but the game said they needed to take the key first. So the user hasn't taken the key yet. Therefore, the correct next action is to take the old key from the trunk. Then, after taking it, insert it into the lock. So the user's last action was trying to unlock the door with the key, but since they didn't take it, the game is pointing out that they need to take it first. Therefore, the next action should be to take the key from the trunk.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text adventure game. The goal seems to be to follow a series of steps to reach the original goal, which isn't explicitly stated but implied by the instructions.

So far, the user has opened the antique trunk, taken the old key, and tried to unlock the door. But there was a confusion about inserting the key into the lock. The system corrected that you need to take the key first. Now, the user has successfully taken the key, so the next logical step would be to use it to unlock the wooden door.

The previous attempt was to "unlock wooden door with old key," but the system said you need to take the key first. Now that the key is in hand, the correct action should be to unlock the door. After that, the door should open, allowing movement east as per the initial instructions. Then, the user needs to check the screen door, go east, try to go south, pick up the milk, etc.

So the next action should be to unlock the door with the old key. Once that's done, the door opens, and the user can proceed east. Then follow the subsequent steps mentioned in the original instructions. The user is on the right track, so the next command is to unlock the door.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the steps in the TextWorld game. The current situation is that they've unlocked the wooden door, but the game is prompting them to go east. However, the game says they have to open the wooden door first. Wait, but they just unlocked it. Maybe there's a confusion between unlocking and opening. Let me check the previous steps.

Earlier, the user opened the antique trunk, took the old key, unlocked the wooden door. Now, the game says they need to open the wooden door first. But they already unlocked it. Maybe the game considers unlocking as different from opening. Or perhaps the door is locked, and unlocking is part of the process. But the user has already unlocked it. The next step was to go east, but the game says they need to open the door first. Wait, maybe the door is still closed even after unlocking? That doesn't make sense. Or maybe the game is expecting them to open the door after unlocking. But the user has already unlocked it. Hmm.

Wait, the user's last action was "go east", but the game says they have to open the wooden door first. But the user just unlocked it. Maybe the game is in a state where the door is locked, and they need to open it. But the user already unlocked it. Maybe there's a mistake in the game's feedback. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to open the door after unlocking. But the game's message is conflicting. The user is at the bedroom, has the key, unlocked the door, but the game says they need to open it first. Maybe the correct action is to open the door, but the user already unlocked it. This is confusing. 

But according to the game's feedback, the user has to open the wooden door first. So even though they unlocked it, the game is saying they need to open it. Maybe the game considers unlocking as different from opening. So the user needs to open the door after unlocking. But how? The user has already unlocked it. Maybe the game is in a state where the door is locked, and unlocking is part of the process. But the user has already done that. Maybe the game is expecting them to open the door, which might be a separate action. So the next step should be to open the door. But the user already unlocked it. This is a bit of a loop. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go east after opening the door. But the game says they have to open the door first. So the correct action here is to open the door. But the user has already unlocked it. Maybe the game is not recognizing that the door is unlocked. So the user needs to open the door again. But that's not logical. Maybe the game is in a state where the door is closed, and the user needs to open it. But the user has already unlocked it. 

In this case, the user's next action should be to open the wooden door. Even though they have already unlocked it, the game's feedback is saying that they need to open it first. So the correct action here is to open the door. Therefore, the next command should be "open wooden door".

Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game called TextWorld. The goal seems to involve opening a trunk, getting a key, unlocking a door, and then moving around to collect items like milk and eventually sit it on a stove.

Looking at the conversation history, the user has been trying to follow the steps given in the initial instructions. The assistant has been guiding them through the actions, but there's some confusion. For example, the user tried to insert the key into the door's lock before taking the key from the trunk, which was incorrect. Then they correctly took the key, unlocked the door, and opened it. Now, after opening the door, the next step according to the original instructions was to check if the screen door is open and then go east again. But the user's last action was opening the wooden door, and the system responded that they need to check the screen door.

Wait, the user's last action was "open wooden door", which was correct, and the system said "You open wooden door." Then the next prompt says to check if the screen door is wide open. But the user hasn't mentioned the screen door yet. The original instructions said after opening the wooden door, double-check the screen door is open, then go east, then try to go south, etc.

So the next step after opening the wooden door (which was just done) is to check the screen door. But the user hasn't done that yet. However, in the current prompt, the user is asked to think and then say the next action. The assistant's previous response was "open wooden door", which was correct, and now the system is at the point where the screen door needs to be checked.

But the user's last action was "open wooden door", which was correct, and the system's response was "You open wooden door." Then the next step according to the original plan was to double-check the screen door is open. So the next action should be to check the screen door. However, in the game's context, the user might need to "open" the screen door if it's closed. But the original instruction says "doublecheck that the screen door is wide open," so maybe the action is to check it, but in the game's terms, perhaps the command is "open screen door" if it's closed. However, the user might not have interacted with the screen door yet.

But looking at the current state, after opening the wooden door, the user is in the next room (east of the bedroom). The next step in the original plan was to check the screen door. However, the user hasn't mentioned the screen door yet. The assistant's next action should be to check the screen door. But how is that done in the game? The user might need to "open" the screen door if it's closed. But the original instruction says "doublecheck that the screen door is wide open," so maybe the action is to "open screen door" if it's not already open.

But the user's last action was "open wooden door", which was correct. Now, the next step is to check the screen door. However, the user hasn't interacted with the screen door yet. So the next action should be to open the screen door. But the user might need to "open screen door" or "check screen door". However, in the game's context, the correct command would be "open screen door" if it's closed. But the original instruction says to "doublecheck that the screen door is wide open," which might mean that the user needs to ensure it's open. So the next action is to open the screen door. But the user might have to do that. However, in the current prompt, the user is told that they have to check the screen door. So the next action is to open the screen door.

But in the previous steps, the user was told that after opening the wooden door, they need to check the screen door. So the next action is to open the screen door. Therefore, the correct command is "open screen door".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the steps in the TextWorld game. They started by opening the antique trunk, taking the old key, and unlocking the wooden door. Then they went east, but the game said they needed to open the wooden door first. They tried opening it again, which worked, and then tried to open the screen door, but that wasn't possible.

Now, the next step according to the original instructions was to go east after opening the screen door. But since the screen door isn't there, maybe they need to check other directions or look for another way. The user is at the bedroom, having opened the wooden door leading east. Maybe after opening the door, they should go east to the next room. But the game might have a different layout. Alternatively, perhaps the screen door is a mistake, and the correct next step is to go east again. The user's last action was trying to open the screen door, which didn't work. So the next logical step would be to go east again, as that was the next instruction after opening the wooden door. So the correct command here is "go east".

You have walked into the most ordinary of all possible kitchens. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You see a refrigerator. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You can make out a counter. The counter appears to be empty. Look over there! a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a kitchen island. The kitchen island is ordinary. On the kitchen island you can see a note. Classic TextWorld.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Kitchen now. The original goal was to follow a series of steps: open the trunk, get the key, unlock the door, go east, check the screen door, go east again, try to go south, pick up milk, then go north and west, and put the milk on the stove.

So far, they've opened the trunk, taken the key, unlocked the door, went east to the kitchen. Now, in the kitchen, there's a note on the stove. The next step according to the original instructions was to lift the milk from the floor of the garden. But wait, the user is in the kitchen now. Maybe they need to go north or south to reach the garden?

Wait, the current room is the kitchen. The description mentions a stove, a counter, a refrigerator, and a screen door east, a wooden door west, and an exit north. The user's next action should be to go south, as per the original plan. But the kitchen's south direction is unguarded. However, the original plan said after going east (from the bedroom), check the screen door, then go east again, then try to go south. But in the kitchen, the user is already east of the bedroom. Maybe the garden is south of the kitchen?

Alternatively, maybe the milk is in the garden. The user needs to go south from the kitchen to the garden, pick up the milk, then go north back to the kitchen, then west to the bedroom, then put the milk on the stove. But the original instructions said after picking up the milk, venture north, then go west. So perhaps the milk is in the garden, which is south of the kitchen.

So the next step would be to go south from the kitchen. But the user is in the kitchen now. The current room's description says there's an exit to the north, and south is unguarded. So the user should go south to the garden, pick up the milk, then return north to the kitchen, then go west to the bedroom, and put the milk on the stove. But the original plan said after picking up the milk, venture north. So maybe after getting the milk, go north back to the kitchen, then west to the bedroom.

But the user is in the kitchen now. The next action should be to go south to the garden. However, the user's previous action was "go east" from the bedroom, which led them to the kitchen. Now, in the kitchen, the next step is to go south to the garden. So the correct command would be "go south".

You are in a living room. An usual one. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

You can make out a couch. You see a lettuce on the couch. You make out a low table. The low table is typical. On the low table you can make out a remote. You scan the room for a tv, and you find a tv. The tv is typical. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well

You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text adventure game. They've been moving through different rooms: bedroom, kitchen, living room. The original goal was to follow a series of steps involving the antique trunk, old key, unlocking the door, going east, checking the screen door, then moving south, picking up milk, etc.

So far, the user has opened the antique trunk, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door, opened it, went east to the kitchen, then south to the living room. The current location is the living room. The next step in the original instructions was after going south, to "lift the milk from the floor of the garden." But the user is now in the living room, not the garden. 

Wait, maybe there's a misunderstanding. The user's previous action was "go south" from the kitchen, which led them to the living room. The next step in the original plan was after going south, they needed to "lift the milk from the floor of the garden." But the user hasn't reached the garden yet. So perhaps they need to continue moving east from the living room? But the living room's description says there's a door north, but the user is supposed to go south from the kitchen. Wait, the living room's description says "You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked." So maybe the user is in the living room, and the next step is to go north back to the kitchen? But that doesn't align with the original plan. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go east from the living room. But the living room's description doesn't mention a door east. The original plan said after going south, they should "venture north" and then "go west" to sit the milk on the stove. But the user is in the living room now. Maybe the user needs to go north back to the kitchen, then east to the garden? But the kitchen's description mentioned a screen door east, which was previously opened. Wait, the user had opened the screen door in the bedroom, but maybe that's not the same as the kitchen's screen door. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go east from the living room. But the living room's description doesn't mention a door east. The only door mentioned is north. So perhaps the user is stuck here. But according to the original plan, after going south, they need to "venture north" and then "go west." So maybe from the living room, go north to the kitchen, then west back to the bedroom? But that seems like going back. 

Wait, maybe the user is supposed to go east from the living room. But the living room's description doesn't mention a door east. The user might have missed a door. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check the kitchen again. The kitchen had a screen door east, which the user might have opened earlier. But the user is in the living room now. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go north from the living room to the kitchen again, then east to the garden. But the original plan said after going south, venture north, then go west. Maybe the user is supposed to go north from the living room to the kitchen, then west to the bedroom, but that seems like going back. 

Wait, the original plan was: after unlocking the door and going east to the kitchen, then check the screen door (which was opened), then go east again, then attempt to go south. But the user went south from the kitchen to the living room. Now, in the living room, the next step is to "lift the milk from the floor of the garden." But the user hasn't reached the garden yet. So maybe the user needs to go east from the living room, but there's no door mentioned. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go north from the living room back to the kitchen, then east to the garden. But the kitchen's east door is the screen door, which was opened. So perhaps the user needs to go north from the living room to the kitchen, then east to the garden. But the user is in the living room now, so the next action should be to go north. However, the user's previous action was "go south" from the kitchen, leading to the living room. So the next step would be to go north back to the kitchen, then east to the garden. 

But according to the original plan, after going south, they should "venture north" and then "go west." So maybe from the living room, go north to the kitchen, then west to the bedroom. But that's not the garden. 

This is confusing. The user is in the living room, and the next step is to "lift the milk from the floor of the garden." But the user hasn't reached the garden yet. So maybe the user needs to go east from the living room, but there's no door mentioned. Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go north to the kitchen, then east to the garden. 

But the user is in the living room. The living room's description says there's a door north. So the next action should be to go north back to the kitchen. Then, from the kitchen, go east to the garden. But the user hasn't done that yet. 

So the correct next action would be to go north from the living room to the kitchen, then east to the garden. But the user is in the living room now, so the next command should be "go north."

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game where they have to follow a series of steps to reach the goal. The current location is the Kitchen, and the score is at 5/11. The user's previous action was "go north", which took them back to the Kitchen. Now, they need to figure out the next correct action based on the instructions given at the beginning.

Looking back at the original instructions, after unlocking the wooden door and going east, they needed to check if the screen door is open. But earlier, when they tried to open the screen door, it wasn't there. Then they went east again, which led them to the Living Room, and then back to the Kitchen. Now, they need to proceed with the next step after the Kitchen.

The original plan was: after going east from the bedroom, check the screen door, then go east again, then try to go south. But in the current state, they're in the Kitchen again. The next step mentioned was "venture north" after picking up the milk. Wait, but the user hasn't picked up the milk yet. The milk was in the garden, which they hadn't reached yet.

Wait, the original steps were: after unlocking the door and going east, check the screen door, then go east again, then try to go south. Then, after that, lift the milk from the garden, go north, then west, then put the milk on the stove. But the user is currently in the Kitchen. So maybe they need to go south from the Kitchen to reach the garden? But the Kitchen's description says there's an exit to the north, and south is unguarded. Wait, in the Kitchen description, the user can go south, which is unguarded. So maybe going south from the Kitchen would take them to the garden where the milk is.

But the user hasn't picked up the milk yet. So the next step would be to go south from the Kitchen to the garden, pick up the milk, then go north, then west, then put the milk on the stove. However, the user's current action is in the Kitchen, so the next step would be to go south. But the user's last action was "go north", which brought them back to the Kitchen. So the next action should be to go south from the Kitchen to reach the garden. But the user's score is 5/11, and they need to follow the steps carefully.

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go east from the Kitchen through the screen door. But the screen door is closed. Wait, in the Kitchen, there's a closed screen door leading east. So maybe they need to open it first. But the original instructions didn't mention opening the screen door, just checking if it's open. But earlier, when the user tried to open it, the game said they couldn't see it. So perhaps the screen door is not present here. Wait, the user is in the Kitchen, and the description says there's a closed screen door leading east. So maybe the user needs to open it. But the original instructions said to double-check the screen door is wide open before going east. But the user tried to open it and it wasn't there. Maybe that was a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the screen door is in a different location.

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go south from the Kitchen to reach the garden. The original plan was after going east, then check the screen door, then go east again, then try to go south. But perhaps the user is now in the Kitchen and needs to go south to the garden.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text adventure game. Their goal seems to involve opening a trunk, getting a key, unlocking a door, and then navigating through different rooms. So far, they've managed to open the antique trunk in the bedroom, take the old key, unlock the wooden door, and go east into the kitchen. Then they went south to the living room and back.

The current location is the Living Room. The user's next action should be to go north again, as the提示 says "try going north, that entranceway is unblocked." But the user has been going back and forth between kitchen and living room. The original goal mentioned going east, then south, then north, then west, and sitting milk on the stove. But maybe the user is stuck in a loop.

Wait, the user's score is at 5/12. The original instructions had several steps: open trunk, get key, unlock door, open door, go east, check screen door, go east again, try to go south, pick up milk, go north, west, then put milk on stove. But in the current state, the user is in the Living Room, and the next step after going north would take them back to the kitchen. But the user might need to find the milk in the garden. However, the current path doesn't mention the garden yet. Maybe the user hasn't ventured outside the house yet.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east from the kitchen through the screen door to reach the garden. But in the kitchen, the screen door is closed. The user hasn't opened it yet. So the next logical step would be to open the screen door east in the kitchen. But the user's last action was going south to the living room. So perhaps the user needs to go back to the kitchen, open the screen door, and then proceed east to the garden. Then, once in the garden, pick up the milk and follow the subsequent steps.

But according to the current prompt, the user is in the Living Room, and the hint says to try going north. So the correct next action would be to go north back to the kitchen. However, the user might have already done that. Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go east from the kitchen through the screen door. But the screen door is closed. So the user needs to open it first. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action should be to open the screen door east in the kitchen. But the user is currently in the Living Room.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Kitchen and Living Room, going back and forth between them. The original goal was to reach the garden, pick up the milk, and then do some actions. But so far, the user has only managed to open the antique trunk, get the key, unlock the door, and move east to the kitchen. They've been going back and forth between the kitchen and living room without making progress towards the garden.

The user's current score is 5, and they're at the kitchen again. The next step mentioned in the original instructions was to lift the milk from the floor of the garden. But the user hasn't reached the garden yet. The current location is the kitchen, which doesn't mention a garden. So the user needs to find a way to get to the garden.

Looking at the rooms described, the kitchen has a closed screen door leading east and an open wooden door west. The living room has a north exit. The user has been going north and south between kitchen and living room, but that doesn't help. Maybe the screen door in the kitchen is the way to go. The user tried opening the screen door earlier but got a message saying they can't see any such thing. Wait, maybe the screen door is in the kitchen, leading east. The user needs to open it.

But in the previous attempt, when they tried to open the screen door, the game said they couldn't see it. However, in the current kitchen description, there is a closed screen door leading east. So maybe the user needs to try opening it again. The original plan was to double-check the screen door is open, then go east, then try to go south, etc. But the user hasn't done that yet.

So the next logical step would be to open the screen door in the kitchen. The user's last action was going north, which brought them back to the kitchen. Now, they need to open the screen door east. The command should be "open screen door" or "open east door". But the game might require the exact phrase. The previous attempt was "open screen door", but the game said they couldn't see it. However, the current kitchen description does mention a closed screen door leading east. So maybe the user needs to try opening it again.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east through the screen door. But the game said they can't see it. Wait, maybe the screen door is in the kitchen, and the user needs to open it. The correct command would be "open screen door" again. Let's check the previous interactions. The user tried "open screen door" and got a message saying they can't see it. But in the current kitchen description, the screen door is present. Maybe the user needs to try opening it again. So the next action should be "open screen door".

Now, the user is at the Kitchen again, and the next action should be to go east, as per the original plan.

But the user's previous action was "go east" which led them to the Living Room, and then they kept cycling between Kitchen and Living Room by going north and south. The original goal mentioned after opening the screen door (east) was to "go to the east" and then "take a trip south". However, the user is now in the Kitchen again, and the screen door is open. So the next logical step after opening the screen door would be to go east through the screen door. But the user might have already done that. Wait, the original steps said after opening the screen door, go east, then try to go south. But the user is currently in the Kitchen, so maybe after opening the screen door, they need to go east to the next room, which might be the Garden or another area.

The next step according to the original plan was to lift the milk from the floor of the garden. The user has just entered the garden, and the description mentions a milk on the floor. So the next action should be to pick up the milk. 

The user's score is at 8/16, so they're progressing. The goal was to pick up the milk, then go north, then west, then put the milk on the stove. Since they're in the garden now, the immediate next step is to take the milk. 

I need to make sure the command is correct. The game might require using "take milk" or "pick up milk". But in previous steps, the user used "take old key", so maybe "take milk" is the right command here. 

Wait, the user's last action was "go south", which led them to the garden. Now, the prompt says there's a milk on the floor. So the next action is to take the milk. Then, after that, they need to go north.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Backyard again after going north from the Garden. The original goal was to pick up the milk from the garden, then go north, then west, and put the milk on the stove. Wait, but the user just came back to the Backyard. Let me check the steps again.

The user had to: after picking up the milk in the garden, go north (which took them back to the Backyard), then go west. Then, put the milk on the stove. But the stove is in the Kitchen, right? Wait, maybe the stove is in the Backyard? No, the user was in the Garden, then Backyard, then Kitchen, then Living Room, etc. Wait, the original instructions said after picking up the milk, venture north (from the Garden) which led to Backyard, then go west. But the stove is in the Kitchen. Hmm, maybe there's a mistake here.

Wait, the user's previous action was going north from the Garden, which brought them back to the Backyard. Now, they need to go west from the Backyard. The Backyard has an open screen door leading west, which would take them back to the Kitchen. Then, from the Kitchen, maybe they can go east to the Living Room, but the original goal was to put the milk on the stove. The stove is in the Kitchen. So after going west to the Kitchen, they can put the milk on the stove. But the user is currently in the Backyard, so the next step is to go west to the Kitchen. Then, in the Kitchen, put the milk on the stove. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the correct next action is to go west from the Backyard to the Kitchen. Then, in the Kitchen, put the milk on the stove. But the user is at the Backyard now, so the next command should be "go west".

GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Kitchen =-
You have walked into the most ordinary of all possible kitchens. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You see a refrigerator. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You can make out a counter. The counter appears to be empty. Look over there! a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a kitchen island. The kitchen island is ordinary. On the kitchen island you can see a note. Classic TextWorld.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps given in the initial instructions. They started by opening the antique trunk in the bedroom, taking the old key, unlocking the wooden door, and then proceeding east. They've navigated through several rooms, including the kitchen, living room, backyard, and garden. In the garden, they picked up the milk, which was part of the earlier instructions.

Now, the current location is the kitchen again. The next step according to the original plan was to sit the milk on the stove. But in the kitchen, the stove is described as being empty. The user has the milk in hand, so the next logical action would be to place it on the stove. However, the game's response when they tried to go west led them back to the kitchen. So, the correct action here is to put the milk on the stove. The user needs to command "put milk on stove" to complete that step. Let me check if that's the right move. Yes, because the instruction said after picking up the milk, venture north, then go west, and then sit the milk on the stove. So, the next step is indeed putting the milk on the stove.
