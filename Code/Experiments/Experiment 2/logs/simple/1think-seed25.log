Welcome to another profound episode of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First, it would be good if you could ensure that the chest drawer in the bedroom is open. Then, take the old key from the chest drawer. And then, make it so that the wooden door in the bedroom is unlocked with the old key. After that, ensure that the wooden door inside the bedroom is open. Then, go east. That done, ensure that the screen door in the kitchen is open. After pulling open the screen door, travel east. Then, move south. And then, retrieve the milk from the floor of the garden. Then, try to go to the north. Following that, move west. With that done, sit the milk on the stove. That's it!

-= Bedroom =-
You are in a bedroom. A normal kind of place.

You scan the room for a chest drawer, and you find a chest drawer. You can see an antique trunk. You make out a king-size bed. The king-size bed is ordinary. However, the king-size bed, like an empty king-size bed, has nothing on it.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me see. The user is in a text-based game and has already opened the chest drawer in the bedroom, finding an old key. The next step according to the initial instructions was to unlock the wooden door in the bedroom with that key. So the next action should be to unlock the door.

Wait, the game's current state shows the wooden door is closed. The player has the old key, so they need to use it to unlock the door. The command would be something like "unlock wooden door with old key". But in the game's context, maybe the correct syntax is "unlock door" after using the key. Alternatively, the game might require specifying the key. Let me check the previous steps again.

The user was told to "make it so that the wooden door in the bedroom is unlocked with the old key." So the action is to unlock the door using the key. The correct command would be "unlock wooden door with old key". But I need to make sure that's the exact command the game expects. Since the user previously opened the chest drawer and found the key, the next logical step is to use the key to unlock the door. So the next action is to unlock the door with the key.

Okay, let me figure out what to do next. The user tried to unlock the wooden door with the old key, but the game said they need to take the key first. Wait, but they already took the key from the chest drawer earlier. Let me check the history.

Earlier, the user opened the chest drawer and found the old key. So the key is in their inventory. Maybe the command should be "take old key" again to pick it up, but they already did that. Or maybe the game is expecting the key to be in a specific location. Wait, perhaps the key is still in the chest drawer, and they need to take it again. But the user already opened the drawer and took the key. Hmm, maybe the game is designed so that after opening the drawer, the key is now in hand, but the command needs to be "take old key" again. Or maybe the correct action is to use the key on the door. Wait, the error message says "You need to take the old key first," which suggests that the key isn't in the inventory. But the user already took it. Maybe the game requires the key to be in the inventory before unlocking. So perhaps the correct next step is to take the key again, even though they already did. Or maybe the key is in the chest drawer, and they need to take it again. Wait, the user opened the chest drawer and found the key. So the key is now in their inventory. But the game is saying they need to take it first. Maybe the game is expecting the key to be picked up again. Alternatively, maybe the command should be "use old key on wooden door" or something similar. But the correct syntax might be "unlock wooden door with old key". But the game says they need to take the key first. So perhaps the key is not in the inventory, so the user needs to take it again. But they already did. This is confusing. Let me retrace the steps. The user opened the chest drawer, found the key, and the game said "You open the chest drawer, revealing an old key." Then the user's next action was "unlock wooden door with old key", which resulted in an error. The error says "You need to take the old key first." So maybe the key is not in the inventory. Wait, perhaps the key is still in the chest drawer, and the user hasn't taken it yet. But the user opened the drawer, so the key should be there. Maybe the game requires the user to take the key again. So the correct next action is "take old key" again. But the user already did that. Alternatively, maybe the key is in the chest drawer, and the user needs to take it again. So the next action is "take old key". But the user already did that. Hmm. Maybe the game is expecting the key to be in the inventory, but the user hasn't picked it up yet. Wait, the initial step was to open the chest drawer, which revealed the key. So the key is now in the inventory. But the game says the user needs to take it first. Maybe the game's parser is expecting the key to be taken again. So the next action is "take old key". But the user already did that. This is a bit confusing. Alternatively, maybe the correct action is to use the key on the door. But the game says the key needs to be taken first. So perhaps the user needs to take the key again. So the next action is "take old key".

Okay, let's see. The user is in a text adventure game. The goal is to follow a series of steps to reach the original goal, which is probably to get the milk to the stove or something similar. So far, the user has opened the chest drawer in the bedroom, found the old key, took it, and now the next step is to unlock the wooden door with the key.

The previous attempt was to unlock the door with the key, but the game said they needed to take the key first. But the user just took the key again, so now they should be able to unlock the door. The next logical step is to unlock the door using the old key. The correct command would be "unlock wooden door with old key". Let me check the game's response after taking the key. The score increased, so it's probably valid. Now, the user needs to proceed to unlock the door. So the next action is to unlock the door with the key.

You've just walked into a kitchen. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You can make out a refrigerator. Hey, want to see a counter? Look over there, a counter. The counter is standard. But the thing is empty. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You scan the room, seeing a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.
