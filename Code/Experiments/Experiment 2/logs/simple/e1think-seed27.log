Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. Your first objective is to look and see that the antique trunk is open. After that, pick up the old key from the antique trunk in the bedroom. After that, insert the old key into the wooden door inside the bedroom's lock to unlock it. And then, ensure that the wooden door in the bedroom is open. After that, travel east. Okay, and then, doublecheck that the refrigerator is ajar. Then, take the milk from the refrigerator. Then, place the milk on the stove inside the kitchen. That's it!

-= Bedroom =-
You arrive in a bedroom. A standard kind of place.

You can make out a closed chest drawer. You can see an antique trunk. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a king-size bed. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Bedroom in TextWorld. Their goal is to open the antique trunk, get the old key, unlock the door, go east, check the fridge, take milk, and put it on the stove.

First, they tried to look at the antique trunk, but it's closed. The next step should be to open it. The trunk is described as strong and impossible to crack, so maybe there's a way to open it. The user might need to use the key from the trunk, but wait, the key is inside the trunk. Wait, the original instructions say to pick up the old key from the trunk. So first, open the trunk, then take the key.

But the trunk is closed. So the first action was looking at it, but it's still closed. The next logical step is to try to open it. The user might need to use a tool or find a way to open it. But in the game, maybe the action is simply to open it. So the next command should be to open the antique trunk.

Wait, the user's previous action was "look at antique trunk", which didn't work. Now, they need to try opening it. So the next action should be "open antique trunk". Then, after opening, they can pick up the key. Then proceed to the next steps.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game, and they've been following the instructions step by step. The current scenario is in the bedroom, and they just opened the antique trunk to find an old key. The next step according to the original plan was to pick up the key from the trunk.

So, after opening the trunk and finding the key, the next logical action would be to take the key. The user's next move should be to pick up the old key. Then, after picking it up, they need to insert it into the wooden door's lock to unlock it. But right now, the immediate action is to take the key from the trunk. The game's response after opening the trunk mentions that the score increased, so the user is on the right track. The answer should be "take old key" to continue the sequence.

Okay, let's see. The user has to follow a series of steps in the TextWorld game. So far, they've opened the antique trunk, taken the old key, and the next step is to insert the key into the wooden door's lock to unlock it. The current location is the bedroom, and there's a closed wooden door leading east. The next action should be to use the key on the door.

Wait, the user's previous action was taking the key, so now they need to go to the door. But the door is closed. The instructions say to insert the key into the lock. So maybe the next step is to go to the door, then use the key. But the user has to follow the exact steps given. The original plan was: after picking up the key, insert it into the door's lock to unlock it. Then ensure the door is open. Then travel east. Then check the fridge, take milk, etc.

So after taking the key, the next step is to go to the wooden door (since it's the only place mentioned where the key would be used). Then insert the key into the lock. The user has to make sure they do that. So the next action should be to go to the wooden door. But the current location is the bedroom, and the door is east. So the user needs to go east first. Wait, the user is in the bedroom, and the door is leading east. So the next step is to go east to the door, then use the key on it.

But the user's next action after taking the key is to insert the key into the door's lock. But to do that, they have to be at the door. So the correct sequence is: go east to the door, then use the key. But the user's previous action was taking the key. So the next step is to go to the door. The user is in the bedroom, and the door is east. So the next command should be "go east" to reach the door. Then, once there, insert the key into the lock. But the user's next action is to insert the key. Wait, but the user hasn't moved to the door yet. So the correct next step is to go east first. The user's last action was taking the key, so now they need to go to the door. Therefore, the next command is "go east".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in the TextWorld game. So far, they've opened the antique trunk, taken the old key, and tried to go east. But the wooden door is closed, so they can't proceed. The next step according to the original instructions was to insert the key into the door's lock to unlock it.

Wait, the user just tried to go east, but the door is closed. The game message says they need to open the door first. So the next logical step is to use the key to unlock the door. The key is in their inventory now, so they should try to use it on the door. The command would be to unlock the door with the key. Let me check the previous steps again. The user took the key from the trunk, so they have it. The door is in the bedroom, leading east. So the correct action here is to unlock the door with the old key. Then, after unlocking, they can go east. So the next command should be to unlock the door.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they need to follow a series of steps. So far, they've opened the antique trunk, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door, and now the door is open. The next step according to the original instructions was to ensure the wooden door in the bedroom is open, which they've done. Then they were supposed to travel east. Wait, the user just unlocked the door, so maybe the next step is to go through the door east.

But the current prompt says "Do you think you're making the right actions..." and the user needs to respond with the next command. The previous action was unlocking the door, and the score is now at -3/6. The next step in the original plan was to travel east after unlocking the door. So the correct next action should be "go east" again. But the user might have already done that? Wait, no. Let me check the history.

Looking back: The user first went to the bedroom, looked at the trunk, opened it, took the key, went east (but the door was closed, so they had to unlock it). Then they unlocked the door. Now, after unlocking, the next step is to open the door (but it's already unlocked). Wait, the original instructions said after unlocking, ensure the door is open. So maybe the user needs to open it again? Or maybe the door is now open. The game's response after unlocking says "You unlock wooden door." So the door is now open. So the next step is to go east through the door. So the next command should be "go east".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in the TextWorld game. So far, they've opened the antique trunk, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door, and tried to go east. But the game is prompting them to open the door first again. Wait, maybe after unlocking, they need to open it to proceed.

The original goal was to look at the trunk, pick up the key, unlock the door, ensure it's open, then go east. Then check the fridge, take milk, etc. But the user is stuck at the door because after unlocking, they might need to open it. But the game says "You have to open the wooden door first." So maybe "unlock" isn't enough; they need to "open" it as well. But the previous action was "unlock wooden door with old key," which worked. Then the next step was "go east," but the game says they need to open the door first. Maybe the door is locked but not open, so after unlocking, they need to open it to pass through. But the user already unlocked it. Hmm, maybe the game is expecting them to "open" the door instead of "unlock"? Or perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the actions. The user might need to "open the wooden door" after unlocking it. But the game's message says they have to open it first, so maybe the correct action is "open wooden door" even though they already unlocked it. Let me check the previous steps again.

The user unlocked the door, and the score increased. Then they tried to go east, but the game says they need to open the door first. So maybe after unlocking, they need to open it to proceed. So the next action should be "open wooden door" to make it open, then go east. But the user already unlocked it. Wait, maybe "unlock" and "open" are different actions here. Maybe the door is locked, so you have to unlock it, then open it. But the game says after unlocking, they need to open it. So the correct next step is to open the door. So the user should say "open wooden door" again. But the user tried "go east" and got a message that they need to open the door first. So the next action should be "open wooden door".

Okay, let me see. The user is playing this text adventure game. Their goal is to follow a series of steps: open the antique trunk, get the key, unlock the door, open the door, then check the fridge, take milk, and put it on the stove.

So far, they've opened the trunk, taken the key, unlocked the door, and opened it. Now they're in the next room, which I assume is the kitchen since the next step mentions the refrigerator. The current location is probably the kitchen because the next instruction is to check if the fridge is ajar.

The user's last action was opening the wooden door, which led them to the next room. Now they need to check the refrigerator. The next step in the original plan is to "doublecheck that the refrigerator is ajar." So the next command should be to look at or check the refrigerator.

But in the game's context, the command might be "look at refrigerator" or "check refrigerator." However, based on previous interactions, the user has been using commands like "look at antique trunk" and "take old key," so maybe "look at refrigerator" is the right command here. Alternatively, if the game expects a different verb, like "examine," but the user has been using "look at" for objects. 

Wait, the user's previous action was "open wooden door," and after that, they are in the next room. The next step is to check the fridge. So the correct command would be to look at the refrigerator. The user needs to confirm if it's open, then take the milk, etc. So the next action should be "look at refrigerator" to check if it's ajar.

Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game where they have to follow a series of steps to complete a task. The current scenario is in the bedroom, and they've already done several actions: opened the antique trunk, took the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door leading east. Now they're in the next room, but the problem is that they need to find the refrigerator and get the milk.

Wait, the user just tried to "look at refrigerator" but couldn't see it. So maybe the refrigerator is in a different room or not visible yet. Let me check the previous steps again. The original goal was to look at the antique trunk, pick up the key, unlock the door, open it, then check the refrigerator, take milk, etc. But after opening the door east, they might have moved to another room. However, the game's response says they can't see the refrigerator. So perhaps the refrigerator is in the kitchen, which is another room. But the user hasn't moved to the kitchen yet.

Wait, the user's last action was "look at refrigerator" in the bedroom, which didn't work. So maybe the refrigerator is in the kitchen, which is another room. But how do they get there? The user has to go east again, but the previous attempt to go east was blocked because the door was locked. But after unlocking and opening the door, they should be able to go east into the kitchen. However, the user might have already moved to the kitchen but didn't find the refrigerator yet.

Alternatively, maybe the refrigerator is in the bedroom, but the user didn't look properly. But the game's response says they can't see it. So the next step would be to check the kitchen, which is east of the bedroom. So the user needs to go east again, enter the kitchen, then look for the refrigerator. But the user tried to look at the refrigerator in the bedroom and failed. So the correct next action is to go east into the kitchen, then look for the refrigerator there.

But the user's last action was "look at refrigerator" in the bedroom, which didn't work. So the next step is to move to the kitchen. Therefore, the next command should be "go east" again to enter the kitchen. Then, once in the kitchen, look at the refrigerator. So the user needs to go east again, even though they might have already done that. But in the previous steps, after opening the door, they went east, but maybe the game is in a loop or there's a mistake. Wait, the user's last action was "open wooden door", which succeeded, so they should be in the next room (kitchen). But the game's response says they can't see the refrigerator. So maybe the refrigerator is in the kitchen, and the user needs to look at it there. So the next action is to look at the refrigerator in the kitchen. But the user tried to look in the bedroom. So the correct next step is to check the kitchen. Therefore, the user should "look around" or "look at refrigerator" again, but in the correct room. However, the user's previous attempt was in the bedroom. So maybe the user is in the kitchen now, but the refrigerator isn't visible. Alternatively, maybe the user is still in the bedroom. Wait, the game's prompt after "open wooden door" says "You open wooden door. Your score...". Then the next prompt is "Do you think...?" So the user is in the room beyond the door, which is the kitchen. But the game says they can't see the refrigerator. That's confusing. Maybe the refrigerator is in the kitchen, but the user hasn't looked properly. So the next action is to look at the refrigerator again, but in the kitchen. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check the kitchen's contents. So the next command should be "look around" or "look at refrigerator". But the user's last action was "look at refrigerator" in the bedroom, which didn't work. Therefore, the correct next step is to go to the kitchen (if not already there) and then look for the refrigerator. But the user might have already moved east. So perhaps the next action is to look at the refrigerator again, but in the correct room. However, the user is in the kitchen now. So the correct action is to look at the refrigerator. But the game says they can't see it. Maybe there's a mistake, but the user needs to proceed. So the next action is to look at the refrigerator again, even though it's not visible. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check the kitchen's items. So the next command is "look around" or "look at refrigerator".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in this text-based game. Their goal is to eventually get milk from the refrigerator, but right now they're in the bedroom. The current problem is that they tried to look at the refrigerator but couldn't see it.

First, I need to recall the previous steps. The user opened the antique trunk, took the old key, unlocked the wooden door, and opened it. Now they're in the next room, probably the kitchen or another area. But the task is to look at the refrigerator, which isn't visible. Maybe the refrigerator is in a different room, or perhaps they need to check another location.

Wait, the original instructions mentioned traveling east after opening the door. The user went east, but maybe the refrigerator is in a different location. Alternatively, maybe the user is in the kitchen but the refrigerator is closed or not visible. However, the user's last action was looking at the refrigerator, which isn't there. So perhaps they need to check another location, like the kitchen or another room.

But the user's next action should be to look for the refrigerator again, but since they can't see it, maybe they need to check the kitchen. Alternatively, maybe the refrigerator is in the bedroom, but the user didn't notice it. However, the initial description of the bedroom didn't mention a refrigerator. The user might have moved to a different room where the refrigerator is located.

Wait, the original goal was to go east after opening the door. The user tried to go east again but was told to open the door first. Then they opened it, and now they're in the next room. Maybe the refrigerator is in that next room. But the user tried to look at it and couldn't. So perhaps the correct action is to look around again or check another object.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check the kitchen's contents. But the user is in the bedroom, and after opening the door, they might have moved to the kitchen. However, the user's current location is the bedroom, and the refrigerator isn't visible. So maybe the user needs to look for the refrigerator in the bedroom, but it's not there. Therefore, the next step might be to check the kitchen or another location.

But the user's next action should be to look at the refrigerator again, but since it's not there, maybe they need to check another place. However, the user's instructions say to look at the refrigerator. Since they can't see it, maybe they need to look around the room again. Alternatively, perhaps the user is in the wrong room. But according to the game's environment, the refrigerator is in the kitchen, which is east of the bedroom. So after opening the door, the user should be in the kitchen. But the user tried to look at the refrigerator and couldn't. Maybe the refrigerator is closed, so they need to open it. But the user's next action should be to look at the refrigerator again, or perhaps check the kitchen's objects.

Wait, the user's last action was looking at the refrigerator, which isn't there. So the next step is to look for the refrigerator again. But since it's not visible, maybe the user needs to check the kitchen. However, the user is in the bedroom. Maybe the user needs to go to the kitchen first. But the user already went east and opened the door. So maybe the user is in the kitchen now. But the refrigerator isn't visible. So perhaps the user needs to look around the kitchen for the refrigerator. But the user's next action is to look at the refrigerator again. Since it's not there, maybe the user needs to check another object. But the user's goal is to find the refrigerator. Therefore, the correct action is to look at the refrigerator again, but since it's not there, maybe the user needs to check the kitchen's contents. However, the user's next action should be to look at the refrigerator again. But the game says they can't see it. So perhaps the user is in the wrong room, but according to the game's setup, the refrigerator is in the kitchen. So the user needs to go to the kitchen and look for it. But the user is already in the kitchen. Therefore, the next action is to look at the refrigerator again, but it's not there. Maybe the user needs to check the kitchen's objects again. But the user's next action is to look at the refrigerator. Since it's not there, maybe the user needs to check another location. However, the user's instructions say to look at the refrigerator. Therefore, the next action is to look at the refrigerator again. But the game says they can't see it. So perhaps the user is in the wrong room. But according to the game's previous steps, after opening the door, the user is in the next room, which is the kitchen. Therefore, the user needs to look for the refrigerator in the kitchen. But the user tried to look and couldn't. So maybe the refrigerator is closed, and the user needs to open it. But the user's next action is to look at the refrigerator. So the correct action is to look at the refrigerator again. However, the game says they can't see it. Therefore, the user might need to check the kitchen again. But the user's next action is to look at the refrigerator. Since the game says they can't see it, the user might need to check another object. But the user's goal is to find the refrigerator. Therefore, the next action is to look at the refrigerator again. However, the game says they can't see it. So maybe the user needs to check the kitchen's objects again. But the user's next action is to look at the refrigerator. Therefore, the answer is to look at the refrigerator again.

-= Bedroom =-
You arrive in a bedroom. A standard kind of place.

You can make out a closed chest drawer. You can see an antique trunk. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a king-size bed. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is an open wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in this text-based game. Their goal is to eventually get the milk from the refrigerator, but they're stuck in the bedroom.

First, they started by looking at the antique trunk, which was closed. Then they opened it and found an old key. They took the key, used it to unlock the wooden door, and then opened the door. Now they're in the next room, but the problem is that they need to find the refrigerator, which they can't see. The user has been trying to look at the refrigerator multiple times but hasn't found it yet.

Looking at the current room description, the bedroom has a closed chest drawer, an antique trunk, a king-size bed, and an open wooden door leading east. The refrigerator isn't mentioned here. So maybe the refrigerator is in the room they just entered after going east. But the user hasn't moved east yet. Wait, the previous action was opening the wooden door, so maybe they need to go east to reach the next room where the refrigerator is located.

The user's next step should be to go east to check the next room. The score is at -4/9, so they need to proceed carefully. The key steps left are to find the refrigerator, take the milk, and place it on the stove. Since the refrigerator isn't visible in the current bedroom, the next logical step is to move east to the next room where the refrigerator might be. So the correct action here is to go east.

-= Kitchen =-
You've entered a kitchen.

You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a refrigerator. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can make out a counter. The counter is normal. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You see a stove. The stove is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You can see a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.



Your score has just gone up by one point.

Okay, let me try to figure out what the next step should be. The user's goal was to take the milk from the refrigerator after opening it. So far, they've managed to open the wooden door in the bedroom and moved to the kitchen. The kitchen has a refrigerator mentioned, but the user hasn't interacted with it yet.

Looking at the current scene in the kitchen, there's a refrigerator in the corner. The user needs to check if it's ajar. The original instructions said to "doublecheck that the refrigerator is ajar" before taking the milk. So the next logical step would be to look at the refrigerator to confirm it's open. If it's open, then they can take the milk. If not, they might need to open it first. But since the user is in the kitchen now, the next action should be to check the refrigerator's status. The command should be "look at refrigerator" to verify if it's open. If it's closed, they might need to open it, but the user's previous action was moving to the kitchen, so the immediate next step is to check the refrigerator.

Okay, the user is trying to follow a series of steps in the TextWorld game. Let me recap the current state to make sure I understand where they are.

First, the user started in the Bedroom. They opened the antique trunk, took the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door east, which led them to the Kitchen. Now, in the Kitchen, they need to check if the refrigerator is ajar. The user tried looking at the refrigerator, but it's closed. The next step according to the original goal was to double-check the refrigerator is ajar, then take the milk from it, and place it on the stove.

But in the current state, the refrigerator is closed. The user's last action was looking at the refrigerator, which is closed. So the next logical step would be to try opening it. However, the user might not have the right key or method to open it. But in the game's context, maybe they need to use the key again or find another way. Wait, the key was used to unlock the door in the bedroom. Maybe the refrigerator requires a different action, like using the key on it, but that's not clear. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to find a way to open it, like looking for a handle or using a tool. But since the game is text-based, the possible actions are limited to what's described.

Looking at the Kitchen description, the user sees a refrigerator that's closed. The next step should be to try opening it. The user's previous action was looking at it, so the next command should be to open the refrigerator. However, the game might not allow that unless the player uses the correct action. So the correct next step is to try opening the refrigerator. If that fails, maybe there's another way, but according to the instructions, the user should proceed with the next action as per the plan.

Okay, let's see. The user's goal is to take the milk from the refrigerator and put it on the stove. So far, they've opened the refrigerator and found the milk. The next step should be to take the milk.

Wait, the user just opened the refrigerator and saw a tomato plant and milk. The next action should be to take the milk. But the system message says to only output the command. So the correct command here is "take milk". Then, after taking the milk, they need to go to the stove and put it there. But the current location is the kitchen, so maybe they need to go to the stove. But the user's next step is to take the milk first. So the next action is "take milk".

Okay, the user has to place the milk on the stove in the kitchen. Let me check the current state. They just took the milk from the refrigerator, so the next step is to go to the stove. The kitchen scene mentions a stove that's usual but empty. So the action should be to go to the stove. Wait, but the user is currently in the kitchen. The stove is in the kitchen, so they just need to go there. The previous action was taking the milk, so now they need to move to the stove. The correct command would be "go to stove" or "go to stove". But in the game's context, maybe it's "go to stove" or "go to the stove". Let me check the previous interactions. The user was told to "place the milk on the stove inside the kitchen." So after taking the milk, they need to go to the stove. The available commands in the kitchen include the stove. So the next action is to go to the stove.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the kitchen, they took the milk from the refrigerator. The next step was to place the milk on the stove. But when they tried to "go to stove", the game said they can't see any such thing. Hmm, maybe the stove isn't directly accessible by moving there. Let me check the previous descriptions.

In the kitchen description, there's a stove mentioned as "you see a stove. The stove is usual." But the user can't just go to it. Maybe the correct action is to "go south" since the kitchen's exit is south. Wait, the kitchen has an exit to the north, but the user is probably facing the kitchen island. The stove is in the kitchen, so maybe the user needs to use the "go south" command to move to the stove's location. Alternatively, maybe the stove is on the counter, and the user needs to "go to stove" but the game doesn't recognize that. Since the user tried "go to stove" and it didn't work, maybe the correct action is to "go south" to reach the stove. Let me check the kitchen's description again. The kitchen has a closed screen door east, open wooden door west, exit to the north, and the user is supposed to go south. Wait, the user is in the kitchen, and the exit is to the north. But the user needs to go to the stove. Maybe the stove is in the kitchen, so the user is already there. The problem is that the user tried to "go to stove" which isn't a valid command. The correct action might be to "go south" to reach the stove. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "go to stove" but the game expects a different command. Wait, the user is in the kitchen, and the stove is part of the kitchen. Maybe the user needs to "go to stove" but the game doesn't recognize it. Since the user tried that and failed, maybe the correct action is to "go south" to move to the stove's location. Alternatively, maybe the user should "go to stove" again, but the game says it's not possible. Wait, the user is in the kitchen, and the stove is in the kitchen. So maybe the correct action is to "go to stove" but the game doesn't accept that. Maybe the user needs to "go south" to reach the stove. But the kitchen's exit is to the north. Wait, the user is in the kitchen, and the stove is in the kitchen. So the user is already there. Maybe the correct action is to "put milk on stove" directly. But the user needs to be at the stove. Since the user can't go to the stove, maybe the correct action is to "go south" to move to the stove's location. Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to "go to stove" but the game doesn't recognize it. The user tried "go to stove" and it didn't work. So the next action should be "go south" to reach the stove. But the kitchen's exit is to the north. Wait, the kitchen's description says: "You see a stove. The stove is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You can see a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island." So the user is in the kitchen, and the stove is there. The user needs to place the milk on the stove. Since the user is already in the kitchen, maybe the correct action is to "put milk on stove" directly. But the user hasn't done that yet. The user took the milk, now they need to place it on the stove. So the correct command is "put milk on stove". But the user tried "go to stove" which didn't work. So the correct action is to "put milk on stove".
