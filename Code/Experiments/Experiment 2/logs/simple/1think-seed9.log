Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First, it would be good if you could open the chest drawer within the bedroom. And then, take the old key from the chest drawer within the bedroom. With the old key, unlock the wooden door. Then, ensure that the wooden door within the bedroom is open. After that, make an effort to head east. If you can accomplish that, open the refrigerator inside the kitchen. After that, recover the lettuce from the refrigerator in the kitchen. After that, rest the lettuce on the stove. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Bedroom =-
You're now in the bedroom. Let's see what's in here.

You can make out a closed chest drawer. You see an antique trunk. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You make out a king-size bed. The king-size bed is normal. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me see. The user is in the bedroom and just opened the chest drawer, finding an old key. The next step according to the task was to take the old key from the chest drawer. So after opening it, the key is now accessible. The next action should be to pick up the key.

Wait, the user's previous action was "open chest drawer", which worked. Now, the key is inside. So the next command should be "take old key". But I need to check the environment description again. The chest drawer was closed, and after opening, the key is revealed. So taking the key from the chest drawer is the next logical step. Then, after taking the key, the next step is to unlock the wooden door. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action is definitely taking the key. Then, use the key to unlock the door. But the user's next input should be the command to take the key. Let me make sure there's no other step in between. The task says "take the old key from the chest drawer within the bedroom." So after opening the drawer, the key is there. So the next action is "take old key".

Okay, the user has taken the old key from the chest drawer. The next step according to the task is to use the key to unlock the wooden door. The wooden door is closed, so the next action should be to unlock it. The command would be "unlock wooden door". Let me check if there's any other step needed. The task says "unlock the wooden door. Then, ensure that the wooden door within the bedroom is open." So after unlocking, they need to check if it's open. But the immediate next action is to unlock it. So the correct command here is "unlock wooden door".

Okay, the user has just unlocked the wooden door. The next step is to ensure the door is open. But since they just unlocked it, maybe they need to open it fully? Wait, the task says "ensure that the wooden door within the bedroom is open." So maybe after unlocking, they need to open it. But in some games, unlocking might automatically open it. However, the user's previous action was "unlock wooden door", which worked. Now, the next step is to head east, as per the task. The user is in the bedroom, and the door leads east. So the next action should be "go east" to move to the kitchen. Let me check the original task again. The task says: "Then, ensure that the wooden door within the bedroom is open. After that, make an effort to head east." So after unlocking, they need to make sure it's open, then go east. Since they just unlocked it, maybe they need to open it again? Or maybe "ensure open" is just confirming. But the next step is to go east. So the command should be "go east".

Okay, the user tried to go east but the game said they have to open the wooden door first. So the previous action was "go east", but it failed because the door wasn't open. The task says after unlocking the door, they need to ensure it's open. So maybe the door is locked even after unlocking? Or maybe "unlock" and "open" are different actions here. Wait, the user previously unlocked the door with the key. But maybe the door is still closed and needs to be opened. So the correct step is to open the door again. The command should be "open wooden door". Let me check the environment. The door was closed before, and after unlocking, maybe it's locked but not closed. So the next action is to open it. Then, after opening, go east. So the next command is "open wooden door".

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. An usual one.

A closed refrigerator is here. You scan the room for a counter, and you find a counter. The counter is ordinary. But the thing is empty. You move on, clearly infuriated by your TextWorld experience. You see a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You see a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island, so there's that.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.
