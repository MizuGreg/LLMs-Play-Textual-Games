Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an exciting round of TextWorld? You do! Here is how to play! First stop, ensure that the chest drawer within the bedroom is open. And then, pick up the old key from the chest drawer. After that, make absolutely sure that the wooden door is unlocked. Then, ensure that the wooden door is open. After that, venture east. After that, move south. That done, take the bell pepper from the couch in the living room. Then, go north. Then, rest the bell pepper on the stove inside the kitchen. Alright, thanks!

-= Bedroom =-
Well, here we are in the bedroom.

You can make out a chest drawer. You can see a closed antique trunk. You make out a king-size bed. However, the king-size bed, like an empty king-size bed, has nothing on it.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me see. The user is playing this TextWorld game, and they've followed the steps given. The current location is the bedroom. They just opened the chest drawer and found the old key. The next step according to the initial instructions was to pick up the old key from the chest drawer. So after opening it, the next logical action is to take the key.

Wait, the user already did open the chest drawer, and the key is inside. So the next command should be to pick up the key. The response after opening the drawer says the key is there, so the next step is to take it. Then, the user needs to make sure the wooden door is unlocked and opened. But first, the key is in the chest drawer. So the next action is to take the old key. Then, after that, proceed to unlock and open the door. But the user's next input should be the command to pick up the key. So the correct next action is "take old key".

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game, and they've followed the steps given. The original goal was to eventually reach the original goal, which I assume is something like escaping or completing a quest, but the exact goal isn't specified here.

So far, the user has opened the chest drawer in the bedroom, taken the old key, and the score has increased. The next step according to the initial instructions was to make sure the wooden door is unlocked. But wait, the user hasn't done that yet. The previous steps were: open chest drawer, take key, then unlock the wooden door. But the user hasn't unlocked the door yet. However, the key might be needed to unlock it. 

Wait, the initial instructions said: after picking up the old key from the chest drawer, make sure the wooden door is unlocked. So the user has the key now. So the next logical step would be to unlock the door. But how? In text adventures, usually, you have to use the key on the lock. So maybe the command is "unlock wooden door with old key" or something similar. But the game's commands might be different. Alternatively, maybe the door is locked, and the key is needed to unlock it. So the user needs to use the key on the door.

But the user's next action after taking the key was to unlock the door. So the correct command here would be to unlock the wooden door. But the game might require using the key. So the user has the key, so they can unlock the door. So the next action should be to unlock the wooden door. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the answer should be "unlock wooden door".

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps given in the initial instructions. They started by opening the chest drawer in the bedroom, taking the old key, unlocking the wooden door, and now the next step according to the original plan was to ensure the wooden door is open. So after unlocking it, they need to open it. The user's last action was unlocking the door, so the next logical step is to open it. The response should be "open wooden door".

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps given in the initial instructions. They started by opening the chest drawer in the bedroom, taking the old key, unlocking the wooden door, and then opening it. Now they're in the next step, which according to the original plan is to venture east.

Wait, the current location is the bedroom, and after opening the wooden door, the next action mentioned was to "venture east." But the user is at the bedroom, and the wooden door leads east. So after opening the door, the next logical step would be to move east. The user's last action was opening the wooden door, so the next command should be "go east" or "move east." The game's environment might have a direction east that leads to another room, like the living room or another area. Since the original plan says after opening the door, venture east, then move south, then go north, etc., the next action here is definitely moving east. The user has to continue following the sequence. So the correct next command is "go east."

-= Kitchen =-
I am sorry to announce that you are now in the kitchen.

You see a closed refrigerator right there by you. You scan the room, seeing a counter. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You see a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. You can make out a kitchen island. The kitchen island is standard. On the kitchen island you make out a note. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps given in the initial instructions. They started in the bedroom, opened the chest drawer, took the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, then went east to the kitchen. Now, they're in the kitchen, and the next step according to the original plan was to move south after venturing east and then moving south. Wait, the initial instructions said after opening the wooden door, venture east, then move south. But in the current state, the user is in the kitchen, which is east of the bedroom. So maybe the next step is to move south from the kitchen back to the bedroom? But the original goal was to take the bell pepper from the living room, rest it on the stove in the kitchen. Wait, the user hasn't done that yet.

Wait, the steps were: after opening the door and going east (to kitchen?), then move south. But the user is now in the kitchen. The next step in the original plan was to move south from the kitchen? But the kitchen's south direction might lead back to the bedroom. However, the user's next action should be to go south from the kitchen. But the user hasn't picked up the bell pepper yet. Wait, the original plan said after ensuring the door is open, venture east, then move south. Then take the bell pepper from the couch in the living room. Wait, maybe the user is supposed to go north from the kitchen to the living room? Because the kitchen has an exit to the north. Let me check the current location.

In the kitchen, the user can go north, east, west, or south. The exit to the north is unguarded. The original plan said after going east (from bedroom to kitchen), then move south. But maybe that's a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps after going east to the kitchen, the next step is to go north to the living room to get the bell pepper. Because the user hasn't picked up the bell pepper yet. The original instructions said: after opening the door and going east, move south, then take the bell pepper from the couch in the living room. Wait, maybe the user is in the kitchen now, and needs to go north to the living room. But according to the initial steps, after going east (to kitchen), then move south. But the user is in the kitchen now. So maybe the next step is to move south back to the bedroom? But that seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the steps. Let me recheck the original instructions.

Original steps: After opening the door and going east, then move south. Then take the bell pepper from the couch in the living room. Then go north, rest on stove. So after going east (to kitchen), move south. But the user is in the kitchen now. Moving south from the kitchen would take them back to the bedroom. But the bedroom's south is probably the living room? Wait, the initial setup might have the bedroom connected to the living room. But the user hasn't gone to the living room yet. Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go north from the kitchen to the living room. But according to the original steps, after going east (to kitchen), move south. So perhaps the user is supposed to go south from the kitchen back to the bedroom, then proceed to the living room. But the user hasn't done that yet. However, the user is in the kitchen now, and the next step according to the original plan is to move south. But moving south from the kitchen would take them back to the bedroom. Then, from the bedroom, they would need to go east again to the kitchen, but that seems redundant. Maybe there's a confusion in the steps. Alternatively, perhaps the user is supposed to go north from the kitchen to the living room. But the original steps said after going east (to kitchen), move south. So maybe the user is supposed to move south from the kitchen to the bedroom, then proceed to the living room. But the user hasn't done that yet. However, the user is in the kitchen now, so the next action should be to move south. But the user's next action is to move south, which would take them back to the bedroom. But the user hasn't taken the bell pepper yet. So maybe the user is on the right track. The score is at 5/6, so they have 1 more step. The next step is to move south from the kitchen to the bedroom, then go east to the living room to take the bell pepper. But the user is in the kitchen, so the next action is to move south. However, the user's next action is to move south, which would take them back to the bedroom. Then, from the bedroom, they would need to go east again to the kitchen, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go north from the kitchen to the living room. But according to the original steps, after going east (to kitchen), move south. So maybe the user is supposed to move south, but that's not the right path. This is confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the user is supposed to go north from the kitchen to the living room.

-= Living Room =-
You are in a living room. A normal kind of place.

Oh, great. Here's a couch. The couch is typical. On the couch you can see a bell pepper. You see a low table. You see a remote on the low table. You can make out a tv! The tv is usual. However, the tv, like an empty tv, has nothing on it. You move on, clearly upset with your TextWorld experience.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps given in the initial instructions. They started in the bedroom, opened the chest drawer, took the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, then went east to the kitchen. From the kitchen, they went south to the living room. Now, in the living room, they need to pick up the bell pepper from the couch as per the earlier steps.

The next action mentioned in the original plan was to take the bell pepper from the couch. The user has already reached the living room, so the next logical step is to pick up the bell pepper. The score is at 6/7, so they need to complete this step to get to 7/7. The command should be "take bell pepper" to pick it up. Then, after that, they need to go north as per the instructions. But since the current prompt is asking for the next action, the immediate next step is taking the bell pepper.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps given in the initial instruction. They started in the bedroom, opened the chest drawer, took the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, then went east to the kitchen. From there, they went south to the living room, took the bell pepper, and went north back to the kitchen.

Now, the current location is the kitchen again, with the score at 7/9. The next step according to the original plan was to rest the bell pepper on the stove in the kitchen. But in the previous steps, after taking the bell pepper from the living room, the user went north back to the kitchen. So the next logical step would be to place the bell pepper on the stove.

Looking at the kitchen description, the stove is mentioned as being empty. The user has the bell pepper in hand, so the action would be to put it on the stove. The command should be "put bell pepper on stove". That's the next required action based on the original instructions. The user needs to make sure they complete all the steps in order, so placing the bell pepper on the stove is the next correct move.
