Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First step, assure that the chest drawer within the bedroom is opened. And then, retrieve the old key from the chest drawer. After that, make absolutely sure that the wooden door in the bedroom is unlocked with the old key. After that, open the wooden door inside the bedroom. After that, attempt to travel east. Following that, ensure that the refrigerator in the kitchen is open. And then, take the lettuce from the refrigerator inside the kitchen. And then, rest the lettuce on the stove. Alright, thanks!

-= Bedroom =-
You've stumbled into a typical room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be typical. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the bedroom.

As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a chest drawer. You make out a closed antique trunk. You can see a king-size bed. But the thing is empty.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me see. The user wants me to follow a series of steps in the TextWorld game. So far, I've opened the chest drawer in the bedroom and found the old key. The next step was to unlock the wooden door in the bedroom with that key. Wait, the user said "make absolutely sure that the wooden door in the bedroom is unlocked with the old key." So I need to use the key to unlock the door.

But how do I do that in the game? Usually, you'd use the 'unlock' command. So maybe the next action is to unlock the door with the key. Let me check the previous steps again. The user mentioned after retrieving the key, make sure the door is unlocked. So I should try unlocking the door now. The door is closed, so unlocking it would open it? Or maybe the door is locked, and I need to unlock it first. The user said the door is closed and needs to be unlocked. So the correct command would be to unlock the door with the key. Then, after that, open the door. Then go east. Then proceed to the kitchen, open the fridge, take lettuce, put it on the stove. 

So the next step after getting the key is to unlock the door. The current location is the bedroom. The wooden door leading east is closed. So the action should be 'unlock wooden door with old key'. But in the game's command structure, maybe it's 'unlock door with key' or 'use key on door'. But the user's previous action was 'open chest drawer', which worked. So maybe the correct command here is 'unlock door' or 'unlock wooden door'. Since the key is in hand, the game should recognize it. So the next action is to unlock the door. Then open it, then go east. Then proceed to the kitchen. So the next step is to unlock the door.

Okay, let me figure out what to do next. The user tried to unlock the wooden door with the old key, but the game said they need to take the key first. Wait, but they already retrieved the key from the chest drawer. Oh, maybe the key is not in their inventory yet. Let me check the previous steps.

The user opened the chest drawer and found the old key. The game's response was "You open the chest drawer, revealing an old key." So the key is now in the player's inventory. Then the user tried to unlock the door with the key, but the game said they need to take the key first. That doesn't make sense because they already took it. Maybe there's a mistake in the game's feedback, but I have to follow the instructions. Alternatively, maybe the key is not considered "taken" yet. Wait, the game might require using the 'take' command before using it. But in the previous step, the user just opened the chest drawer and the key was revealed. Maybe the correct action is to take the key first. But the user already did that implicitly by opening the drawer. Hmm, maybe the game expects the player to use the key with the 'use' command. So perhaps the next step is to use the key on the door. But the user tried to unlock it and got an error. So maybe the correct command is 'use old key on wooden door' or something similar. Alternatively, the game might require the player to first take the key from the chest, but they already did. This is confusing. Let me think again. The user's last action was trying to unlock the door with the key, but the game said they need to take the key first. So maybe the key is not in their inventory. Wait, maybe the key is in the chest drawer, and the player needs to take it. But they already opened the drawer and the key was there. So perhaps the correct next step is to take the key. But the user already did that. Wait, maybe the game's message is a red herring, and the player can proceed to unlock the door. Alternatively, maybe the key is not in the inventory yet. So the correct action is to take the key first. But the user already did that. This is a bit of a puzzle. Maybe the next step is to try unlocking the door again, even though the game said to take the key. Alternatively, maybe the player needs to use the key on the door. So the next action should be 'unlock wooden door' or 'use old key on wooden door'. Given the previous command that failed, perhaps the correct command is 'use old key on wooden door'. But the game might require the player to first take the key. But the user already took it. I'm a bit stuck here. Let me try to proceed with the correct sequence. The key is in the chest drawer, so the player took it. Now, the next step is to unlock the door with the key. So the command should be 'unlock wooden door with old key'. But the game said they need to take the key first. Maybe the game is expecting the player to use the 'use' command. So the correct action is 'use old key on wooden door'. Alternatively, 'unlock door with old key'. I think the correct next step is to try unlocking the door again, even though the game said to take the key. Maybe the game's message was a mistake. So the next action is 'unlock wooden door'.

Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in the TextWorld game. So far, they've opened the chest drawer and found the old key. But when they tried to unlock the door with the key, the game said they need to take the key first. Wait, but they already took the key from the chest drawer. Maybe the game is expecting them to use the 'take' command explicitly? Let me check the previous steps again.

The user's first action was "open chest drawer", which worked. The game response was that the chest drawer was opened and the old key was revealed. Then the user tried to "unlock wooden door with old key", but the game said they need to take the key first. That suggests that the key isn't in their inventory yet. But how? They just saw it in the chest drawer. Maybe the correct action is to take the key from the chest drawer before trying to use it. Wait, but the user already did that implicitly by opening the drawer. Maybe the game requires the player to use the 'take' command on the key. So the next step should be "take old key" to put it in their inventory. Then, after that, they can try unlocking the door. But the user already did that. Hmm, maybe the game is designed so that even though the key is in the chest drawer, they need to take it explicitly. So the correct next action is "take old key". Let me try that.

Okay, let me see. The user has taken the old key from the chest drawer. Now, the next step is to unlock the wooden door in the bedroom with that key. The previous attempt to unlock the door failed because the game said they needed to take the key first, but after taking it, the user should now be able to unlock the door.

So the correct action here would be to unlock the door using the old key. The command should be "unlock wooden door with old key" or similar. Since the game requires using the key, the next step is to attempt unlocking the door. Let me check the previous interactions. The user tried "unlock wooden door with old key" before taking the key, which failed. Now that the key is in hand, the next command should be to unlock the door. So the answer is "unlock wooden door with old key".

Okay, let's see. The user has successfully unlocked the wooden door in the bedroom. The next step according to the original instructions was to "open the wooden door inside the bedroom." So after unlocking, they need to open it. The command would be "open wooden door." Let me check if that's the correct action here. Since the door is unlocked, opening it should be possible. The user's previous action was unlocking, so now they need to open it. The next command should be "open wooden door."

Okay, the user has opened the wooden door leading east. The next step in the original instructions was to "attempt to travel east." So after opening the door, they should try moving east. The command would be "go east" or "travel east." Since the door is open, moving east should be possible. The next action is to go east into the next room, which is likely the kitchen. So the correct command here is "go east."

You've entered a kitchen. The room is well lit.

You make out a closed refrigerator right there by you. You make out a counter. But there isn't a thing on it. You make out a stove. The stove is standard. But there isn't a thing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an unguarded exit to the north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.
