Welcome to TextWorld! Here is how to play! First thing I need you to do is to doublecheck that the antique trunk is opened. Then, recover the old key from the antique trunk inside the bedroom. Having taken the old key, insert the old key into the wooden door inside the bedroom's lock to unlock it. After that, look and see that the wooden door is ajar. And then, travel east. With that over with, ensure that the screen door is open. And then, attempt to move east. After that, make an attempt to go south. With that accomplished, lift the apple from the floor of the garden. After that, make an attempt to take a trip north. Then, go to the west. With that over with, put the apple on the stove. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Bedroom =-
You find yourself in a bedroom. An ordinary one.

Oh, great. Here's a chest drawer. You make out an antique trunk. Huh, weird. You make out a king-size bed. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me see. The user is playing this text-based game, and they've already opened the antique trunk in the bedroom, finding an old key. The next steps according to the initial instructions were to use the key to unlock the wooden door, then go east, check the screen door, move east again, then go south. After that, they needed to get an apple from the garden, take it north, go west, put it on the stove, and then stop.

So, after opening the trunk and getting the key, the next logical step is to use the key on the locked door. The user mentioned that the wooden door inside the bedroom's lock is supposed to be unlocked with the key. So the next action should be to insert the key into the door's lock. The command would be "use old key on wooden door" or something similar. But in the game's context, maybe the exact phrasing is "unlock wooden door with old key" or just "insert old key into wooden door". 

Looking back at the initial instructions, the user was told to "insert the old key into the wooden door inside the bedroom's lock to unlock it." So the correct command here is to insert the key into the door. The game's previous response was "open antique trunk", and now the next step is to use the key on the door. The user's current location is the bedroom, and the wooden door is leading east. So the next action should be to use the key on the door. The exact command might be "use old key on wooden door" or "unlock wooden door with old key". But since the game might expect a specific format, maybe "insert old key into wooden door". However, in the initial prompt, the user was told to "insert the old key into the wooden door inside the bedroom's lock to unlock it." So the correct action is to insert the key into the door. The game's previous interaction had the user open the trunk, so now they need to use the key on the door. Therefore, the next command should be "use old key on wooden door" or "insert old key into wooden door". But the game's commands might be more specific. Let me check the initial instructions again.

The user's initial instructions said: "Having taken the old key, insert the old key into the wooden door inside the bedroom's lock to unlock it." So the action is to insert the key into the door. The correct command here would be "insert old key into wooden door". However, in some text games, the command might be "use old key on wooden door". But since the user is following the exact steps given, the next action is to insert the key into the door. So the answer should be "insert old key into wooden door".

<think>
Okay, let me figure out what's going on here. The user tried to insert the old key into the wooden door, but the game responded that they need to take the old key first. Wait, but they just opened the trunk and got the key. Maybe the key is still in the trunk, so they need to pick it up first before using it.

Looking back at the previous steps: The user opened the antique trunk and found the old key. But maybe the key is still in the trunk, so they need to take it from the trunk. The game's message says "You need to take the old key first," which suggests that the key isn't in their inventory yet. So the next step is to take the key from the trunk.

So the correct action here is to take the old key from the antique trunk. The command would be "take old key from antique trunk". That makes sense because after opening the trunk, the key is inside, so they need to pick it up before using it on the door.

Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user tried to insert the old key into the wooden door, but the game responded with "That can't contain things." Hmm, maybe the key isn't in the right place. Wait, the user had taken the key from the trunk, so it's in their inventory. But maybe the door's lock is a separate object. Maybe the correct action is to use the key on the lock instead of the door itself.

Alternatively, maybe the door is closed, and the key needs to be used on the lock to open it. The initial instruction said to insert the key into the lock to unlock the door. So perhaps the command should be "unlock wooden door with old key" or "use old key on lock". But the game's previous message said "insert old key into wooden door", which didn't work. Maybe the lock is a different object. Let me check the environment again.

In the bedroom, there's a closed wooden door leading east. The user has the old key. The correct action is to use the key on the lock of the door. So maybe the command is "use old key on lock" or "unlock lock with old key". But the game might expect a specific phrasing. Since the user tried "insert old key into wooden door" and it didn't work, maybe the correct command is "unlock wooden door with old key". Let me try that.

Okay, let's see. The user has successfully unlocked the wooden door with the old key. Now, according to the initial instructions, after unlocking the door, they need to check if it's ajar. Then, travel east. So the next step is to open the door or check it. But since the door is already unlocked, maybe the next action is to go through it. The command would be "go east" since the door leads east. Let me confirm the previous steps.

The user was in the bedroom, unlocked the door leading east. The next step is to move east through the door. So the correct command is "go east".

Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user tried to go east through the unlocked door, but the game says they have to open the wooden door first. Wait, maybe "open" refers to something else. Earlier, the user had to open the antique trunk. But the door is already unlocked. Maybe the door is closed even though it's unlocked? Or perhaps the game considers "unlock" and "open" as different actions. Let me check the previous steps.

The user inserted the key into the lock and unlocked the door. Now, the door might be unlocked but still closed. So the next step is to open it. The command might be "open wooden door". But the game's message says "have to open the wooden door first", so maybe that's the correct action. Alternatively, maybe "unlock" was insufficient, and they need to "open" it separately. Let me try "open wooden door".

The garden has a tomato plant, milk, an apple, and a shovel on the floor. Maybe the apple is hidden or not clearly visible. The user might need to look closer or check a specific location. The original goal was to "lift the apple from the floor of the garden." Perhaps the apple is under something else, like the shovel? Or maybe the user needs to check the tomato plant area. Alternatively, maybe the apple is in a different spot. Let me think of possible commands. Maybe "look around" to find the apple, but the user can only say the command. Alternatively, check under the shovel. But the game might require a different approach. Wait, the user is in the garden, and the apple is on the floor. Maybe the correct command is "take apple" without specifying the floor, but the game says it's not visible. Maybe the apple is in a different location. Alternatively, the user needs to check the tomato plant. But the original instruction says the apple is on the floor. Maybe the game is tricking them, and the apple is actually in a different place. Alternatively, the user needs to check the shovel. Let me try "take apple from tomato plant" or "check tomato plant". But the original description says the apple is on the floor. Hmm. Maybe the correct command is "take apple" without specifying, but the game says it's not visible. Maybe the user needs to look under the shovel. So the next action is "take apple from shovel" or "look under shovel". But the game might expect a different command. Alternatively, maybe the apple is in the milk container. But the original description says the apple is on the floor. I'm confused. The user needs to find the apple. Maybe the correct command is "look around" to find it, but the user can only say the command. Alternatively, check the tomato plant. But the game says the apple is on the floor.

Okay, the user is back in the backyard after going north. The next step according to the original plan was to "go to the west" after taking the apple. The backyard has an open screen door leading west, so the next action should be to go west. Let me check the current location and possible exits.

-= Kitchen =-
You've just sauntered into a kitchen.

Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a refrigerator. You make out a counter. The counter is ordinary. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You make out a stove. The stove appears to be empty. Sometimes, just sometimes, TextWorld can just be the worst. You can see a kitchen island. On the kitchen island you can see a note.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

The stove is in the kitchen, so the user needs to place the apple there. The command would be "put apple on stove". Let me check the current location and objects. The kitchen has a stove that's empty, so putting the apple on it should be the next action.
