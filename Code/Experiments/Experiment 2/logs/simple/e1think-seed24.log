Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First, it would be great if you could assure that the chest drawer is ajar. Then, take the old key from the chest drawer. If you can get your hands on the old key, unlock the wooden door. And then, make it so that the wooden door is ajar. And then, move east. With that over with, ensure that the screen door is open. And then, make an attempt to move east. Next, go to the south. After that, lift the lettuce from the floor of the garden. After that, go north. Okay, and then, venture west. That done, rest the lettuce on the stove. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Bedroom =-
You're now in the bedroom. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You can make out a closed chest drawer. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than an antique trunk, so there's that. You scan the room, seeing a king-size bed. The king-size bed is typical. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me see. The user wants me to follow a series of steps in the TextWorld game. So far, I've opened the chest drawer and found the old key. The next step was to unlock the wooden door. Since I have the key, I should use it to unlock the door. Then, after unlocking, I need to make sure the door is open. Then move east. But wait, the current location is the bedroom. The wooden door leading east is closed. So first, I need to unlock it with the key. Once unlocked, the door should be ajar. Then move east. Let me check the previous steps again.

The user's instructions were: after getting the key, unlock the wooden door and make it ajar, then move east. So the next action should be to unlock the door. The command would be "unlock wooden door" or "use old key on wooden door". But in the game's context, maybe "unlock wooden door" is the correct command. Let me make sure. The key is in the chest drawer, so using it on the door should work. So the next step is to unlock the door. Then, once it's unlocked, move east. Then, the next steps involve the screen door, moving east again, going south, picking up lettuce, etc. But the current task is to unlock the door. So the next action is to unlock the wooden door.

Okay, let's see. The user has to follow a series of steps to win the game. So far, they've opened the chest drawer and taken the old key. Then they tried to unlock the wooden door, but it's fixed. The next step in the original instructions was to make the wooden door ajar. Since the door is fixed, maybe they need to find a way to unlock it with the key. But the user just tried to unlock it and it didn't work. Wait, maybe the door is locked, so using the key would be necessary. But the user already has the key. So the next action should be to use the key on the door. But the command might be "unlock wooden door" again, but maybe the system requires a different command. Alternatively, maybe the door is locked, so they need to use the key to unlock it. The user's next action should be to unlock the door with the key. But in the previous step, they tried to unlock it and it was fixed. Maybe the door is locked, so they need to use the key. So the next command would be "unlock wooden door" again, but maybe the system needs "use key on wooden door" or something similar. However, the user's previous action was "unlock wooden door", which didn't work. So perhaps the correct command is to use the key on the door. But the game's commands might be limited. The user has the key, so they need to use it on the door. The next action should be "use key on wooden door" or "unlock wooden door". Since the previous attempt to unlock failed, maybe the key is needed. So the next step is to use the key on the door. But the user's previous action was "unlock wooden door", which didn't work. So maybe the correct command is "unlock wooden door" again, but the system might require a different action. Alternatively, maybe the door is locked, and the key is needed to unlock it.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they need to follow a series of steps to win. The current scenario is in the bedroom. They've already opened the chest drawer and taken the old key. The wooden door is closed and fixed, so they need to unlock it. But the previous attempts to unlock it didn't work. Now, the user is asked if they think they're on the right track and what their next action should be.

First, I need to check the game's state. The key is in the chest drawer, which they've already taken. The wooden door is closed, so they need to use the key to unlock it. But the previous attempt to unlock the door didn't work. Maybe the door isn't the right one? Wait, the user's original goal was to unlock the wooden door, then move east, then go south, etc. But the door is fixed, so maybe they need to try using the key again. Alternatively, maybe the door is locked, and the key is the right tool. But the game's feedback says the door is fixed, so perhaps the key isn't working. Wait, maybe the user needs to open the door first before unlocking? Or maybe the door is locked, and the key is needed. But the user tried to unlock it and it didn't work. So maybe the next step is to try using the key on the door. Alternatively, maybe the door is not the correct one. Wait, the user's original plan was to unlock the wooden door, then move east. But the door is closed. So the next action should be to try using the key on the door. But the game's response after unlocking was that the door is fixed. Maybe the key isn't the right one? Or maybe the user needs to open the door first. Wait, the user has the key, so they should try to unlock the door again. Maybe the previous attempt was incorrect. So the next action should be to unlock the door again. But the game's response says the door is fixed. Maybe the user needs to try another action. Alternatively, maybe the door is locked, and the key is the correct item. So the next step is to try unlocking the door with the key. But the user has already tried that. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to look for another way to open the door. But the game's description says the door is closed. So the correct action is to try unlocking it again. But the user has already done that. Wait, the user's last action was "look", which didn't change anything. So the next step is to try using the key on the door again. So the next action should be "unlock wooden door" again. But the game might not allow that. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to open the door first. Wait, the door is closed, so maybe the user needs to open it, but the key is needed to unlock it. So the correct action is to unlock the door with the key. But the game's feedback says the door is fixed. Maybe the key isn't working. But the user has the key, so they should try again. Therefore, the next action is to unlock the wooden door again.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in this text-based game. Their goal is to open the chest drawer, get the old key, unlock the wooden door, open it, move east, then go to the south, pick up lettuce, etc. So far, they've managed to open the chest drawer and found the key. But when they tried to unlock the wooden door, it didn't work. The door is fixed in place.

Hmm, maybe the key is needed to unlock the door. But the user already has the key from the chest drawer. Wait, but they didn't use it yet. Maybe they need to use the key on the door. But the game's response says the door is fixed, so maybe the key isn't working here. Or perhaps there's another step needed before unlocking the door. Let me check the previous steps again.

The original instructions said: after getting the key, unlock the wooden door and make it ajar. Then move east. So maybe the door is locked, and the key is required. But the user tried to unlock it and it didn't work. Maybe the key isn't the right one, or maybe they need to use it in a different way. Alternatively, maybe the door is locked from the inside, so they need to find another way to open it.

Wait, the user is in the bedroom. The wooden door leads east. Maybe they need to try using the key on the door. But the game's response says the door is fixed, so perhaps the key isn't working. Maybe the door is locked, and they need to find another method. Alternatively, maybe the key is for a different lock. Or maybe the door is stuck and needs to be pushed or pulled.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to open the door first by some other means, but the game's feedback says it's fixed. So perhaps the key is not the right item, or maybe they need to use it in a different action. Wait, the user has the key, but they haven't used it yet. Maybe the correct action is to use the key on the door. But the game's response doesn't show that as an option. Maybe the game expects the user to try using the key, but the system is not allowing that. Or maybe the door is locked, and the key is for a different lock.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to move east first, but the door is closed. So perhaps the correct action is to try using the key on the door. But the previous attempt to unlock the door didn't work. Maybe the user needs to try a different command, like 'use key on door' or something similar. But the game's available commands might be limited. The user's previous action was 'unlock wooden door', which didn't work. So maybe the next step is to try using the key on the door. But the game's interface might not allow that. Alternatively, maybe the door is locked, and the key is needed, but the user hasn't used it yet.

So perhaps the correct action is to try using the key again, but the game is not allowing that. Maybe the user needs to try a different command. But the available commands are limited. The user's next action should be to try using the key on the door. However, the game might not recognize that as a valid command.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to unlock the wooden door with the old key. They tried "use key on wooden door" but that wasn't recognized. So, maybe the correct command is just "unlock wooden door" again, but the system said it's fixed. Wait, maybe the key isn't being used properly. The key is in the chest drawer, so the user has to use it on the door. But the system might expect a different phrasing. Alternatively, maybe the door needs to be unlocked after using the key. But the previous attempt to unlock failed. Hmm. The user might need to try "open wooden door" instead? Or perhaps "unlock" is the correct verb, but the system is having issues. Wait, the user tried "unlock wooden door" before, and it said the door is fixed. Maybe the key is needed to unlock it, so the correct action is to use the key on the door. But the system didn't recognize "use key on wooden door". Maybe the correct command is "use key on door" or "unlock door with key". But the system might expect "unlock wooden door" again. Alternatively, maybe the key is already in hand, so the user just needs to try unlocking again. But the system says the door is fixed. Maybe the user needs to try a different action.

Maybe the correct action is to try unlocking again, but the system is not accepting it. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to look for another way.

But the system didn't recognize "use key on wooden door". Maybe the correct command is "unlock door" without specifying wooden. Let me check the previous steps. The user had the key from the chest drawer. So the correct action is to use the key to unlock the door. But the system might expect "unlock wooden door" again. Alternatively, maybe the key is not being used properly. Maybe the user needs to "use key on wooden door". But the system said that's not a recognized verb. So perhaps the correct command is "unlock door" or "open door". But the door is closed, so maybe "open door" is the right verb. Wait, the door is closed, but the user tried to unlock it. Maybe the correct action is "open wooden door". Let me think. The user has the key, so they need to use it to open the door. But the system might not accept "use key on door". So maybe the correct command is "open wooden door". Alternatively, "unlock door". But the system might have specific commands. Since the user tried "unlock wooden door" before and it failed, maybe the correct action is to try "open wooden door". Let me check the previous messages. The user tried "unlock wooden door" and the system said the door is fixed. So maybe the key is needed to unlock it, but the system is not recognizing the command. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to try "use key on door". But the system didn't recognize that. So perhaps the correct command is "open door". But the door is closed. Hmm.

Wait, the user tried "unlock wooden door" but it didn't work. Then they tried "use key on wooden door", which was invalid.

But the previous attempt to "use key on wooden door" was rejected. Maybe the correct command is "unlock wooden door with key" or something similar. But the game's verb list might not include "use". Alternatively, maybe the key is in the inventory, and the correct command is "unlock door" after picking up the key. Wait, the user already has the key from the chest drawer. So the next step is to unlock the door with the key. The correct command might be "unlock door" or "use key on door". But the system said "use key on wooden door" was invalid.

Wait, the chest drawer was opened earlier, and the key was there. So maybe the key is in the inventory now. But the game might not be recognizing it.

The user tried "use key on wooden door" but got an error. Maybe the correct command is to "unlock wooden door" with the key. But the game might require specifying the key. Alternatively, maybe the key is already in hand, so the command should be "unlock door" without specifying the key. But the game says "What do you want to unlock wooden door with?" so they need to use the key. But the key isn't visible, so maybe the user needs to pick it up again or check the chest drawer again. Wait, the chest drawer was already opened, so the key is there. But maybe the user didn't pick it up. Wait, the initial action was to open the chest drawer, which revealed the key.

So maybe the correct command is "unlock door" without the key, but the game requires using the key. Alternatively, maybe the key is in the chest drawer, so the user needs to pick it up again.

But the chest drawer is already open. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check the chest drawer again. But the game says the chest drawer is opened and contains the key. Hmm. The user's next action should be to use the key on the door. But the game is not accepting it. Maybe the correct command is "unlock door" with the key. But the game's error message says "What do you want to unlock wooden door with?" so the user needs to specify the key. But the key is in the inventory. Maybe the correct command is "unlock door with key". But the game might not recognize that. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to pick up the key again. Wait, the user already did that. So maybe the correct command is "unlock door" and the game will use the key automatically. But the game is not allowing that. This is confusing. The user's previous action was "use key on wooden door" which failed. So the next step is to try "unlock door" without the key, but the game might require the key. Alternatively, maybe the key is not in the inventory. Maybe the user needs to pick it up again. But the chest drawer is already open. Maybe the user needs to check the chest drawer again. But the game says the chest drawer is opened and contains the key. So the key is there. Maybe the correct command is "take key from chest drawer", but the user already did that. This is a bit of a loop. The user needs to find a way to unlock the door with the key. The game is not accepting "use key on door" or "unlock door with key". Maybe the correct command is "unlock door" and the game will use the key automatically. But the game's error message says "What do you want to unlock wooden door with?" So the user needs to specify the key. Maybe the correct command is "unlock door with key". But the game might not recognize that. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the key on the door. But the game says "That's not a verb I recognise" when they tried "use key on wooden door". So maybe the correct verb is "unlock" instead of "use". So the command should be "unlock door with key". But the game might not accept that. Alternatively, the user needs to "use key on door". But the game says "That's not a verb I recognise". So maybe the correct command is "unlock door" and the key is already in hand. But the game is not allowing that. This is tricky. The user's next action should be to try "unlock door" again, hoping that the key is in the inventory. Alternatively, maybe the key is not in the inventory, so the user needs to pick it up again. But the chest drawer is already open. Maybe the user needs to check the chest drawer again. But the game says the chest drawer is opened and contains the key. So the key is there. Therefore, the correct command is "use key on door" or "unlock door with key". But the game is not accepting it. Maybe the correct command is "unlock door" without the key. But the game requires the key. So the user needs to find a way to use the key. Maybe the correct command is "unlock door" and the game will use the key automatically.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to unlock the wooden door with the old key they found in the chest drawer. They've tried "unlock wooden door" and "use key on wooden door", but the game isn't accepting it. The error messages suggest that the key isn't being used correctly.

First, maybe the command structure is wrong. The game might expect a specific phrase like "use key on door" or "unlock door with key". But the user tried "use key on door" and got an error. Wait, the previous attempt was "use key on wooden door", which the game said "You can't see any such thing." So maybe the key isn't in the inventory or not properly retrieved.

Wait, the user opened the chest drawer and found the old key. So the key should be in their inventory. The problem is how to use it. The correct command might be "use key on door" or "unlock door with key". But the game might require the exact phrasing. Let me check the previous interactions.

The user tried "unlock wooden door" which didn't work. Then "use key on wooden door" which also didn't work. The game says "You can't see any such thing." So maybe the key isn't in the right place. Wait, maybe the key is in the chest drawer, and the user needs to pick it up first. But the user already opened the chest drawer and took the key, right? The game state says the chest drawer is opened and contains the key. So the key should be available.

Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "unlock door with key". Let me think. The user has the key, so using it on the door. The game might require "use key on door" or "unlock door with key". Since the previous attempt "use key on door" was rejected, maybe the correct command is "unlock door with key". Let me try that.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in the TextWorld game. Their goal is to open the chest drawer, get the old key, unlock the wooden door, move east, open the screen door, move east again, go south, pick up the lettuce, then go north and west, and finally put the lettuce on the stove.

So far, the user has opened the chest drawer and found the old key. They tried to unlock the wooden door but kept getting errors. The game is prompting them to use the key on the door, but the previous attempts didn't work. The last error was "You need to take the old key first," which suggests that the key is still in the chest drawer and hasn't been picked up yet.

Wait, in the current state, the chest drawer is opened and the key is there. The user might have forgotten to take the key from the drawer. The next logical step would be to pick up the key first, then use it to unlock the door. The user's last action was trying to unlock the door without taking the key, which is why the game is saying the key isn't available. So the correct action now is to take the key from the chest drawer. Once the key is in hand, they can then try to unlock the door again.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in the TextWorld game. Their goal is to open the chest drawer, get the old key, unlock the wooden door, open it, move east, then go south, pick up lettuce, etc. So far, they've managed to open the chest drawer and take the old key. The next step mentioned was unlocking the wooden door.

But in the previous attempts, the user tried "unlock wooden door" and "use key on wooden door", but the game didn't accept those. The error messages indicated that the key wasn't in the right place or the action wasn't recognized. Then the user tried "use key on door" which also didn't work. Finally, they tried "unlock door with key", which the game didn't recognize either.

Wait, the user just took the old key from the chest drawer, so now the key is in their inventory. The next logical step is to use the key to unlock the wooden door. But the game's response was "You need to take the old key first." which might have been a confusion because the key was already taken. But in the latest step, the user took the key, so now they should be able to use it.

The correct action here would be to unlock the door with the key. But the game might require a specific command format. Maybe "unlock door with key" is not the right syntax. Alternatively, "use key on door" or "unlock door" if the key is already in hand. But the game's previous responses suggest that "unlock door" alone might not work unless the key is used.

Looking at the history, after taking the key, the next step should be to unlock the door. The user's last action was taking the key, so the next command should be "unlock door" or "use key on door". However, the game might require the exact phrasing. Since the user previously tried "use key on door" and it didn't work, maybe the correct command is "unlock door with key". But the game said "That's not a verb I recognise." So perhaps the correct command is "unlock door" assuming the key is already in hand.

Alternatively, maybe the game expects "use key on door". But the user tried that and it didn't work. Wait, the user tried "use key on door" and the game said "That's not a verb I recognise." So maybe the correct command is "unlock door" without specifying the key, as the key is already in the inventory.

So the next action should be "unlock door".

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps to open the chest drawer, get the key, unlock the door, and then proceed through the rooms. So far, they've successfully opened the chest drawer, taken the old key, and unlocked the wooden door. The next step in the original instructions was to move east after unlocking the door.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the bedroom, and the wooden door leading east is now unlocked. The next action should be to move east. The user has already been prompted to move east in the initial instructions, so that's the next logical step. The game's current state allows moving east, so the correct command here is "go east" or "move east". Since the user has been using commands like "unlock door" and "open chest drawer", the most consistent command here would be "go east". 

I need to make sure that the command is in line with the game's expected input. The user has previously used "go north" and "go east" in the initial setup, so "go east" is the right choice here. The next step after unlocking the door is to move east, which aligns with the original plan. Therefore, the correct action is to go east.

Their goal is to open the chest drawer, get the old key, unlock the wooden door, move east, open the screen door, move east again, go south, pick up the lettuce, go north, move west, and then put the lettuce on the stove. 

Currently, the user has successfully opened the chest drawer, taken the old key, and unlocked the wooden door. The next step mentioned was to move east. However, the game response says they have to open the wooden door first. Wait, but they just unlocked it. Maybe "unlock" and "open" are different actions here. The user tried "go east" but was told to open the door first. So perhaps after unlocking, they need to open the door to proceed.

So the correct action here is to open the wooden door again. The user might have confused "unlock" with "open". The game might require them to open the door after unlocking it. So the next step should be to open the door. Then they can go east. Let me check the previous steps again. The user unlocked the door, but maybe the door is still locked even after unlocking. Or maybe "unlock" is part of the process, but they need to open it. The game's response says "You have to open the wooden door first," so even though they unlocked it, they need to open it. So the next command should be "open wooden door" to proceed.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in this text-based game. Their goal is to eventually rest the lettuce on the stove and win. So far, they've managed to open the chest drawer, take the old key, unlock and open the wooden door, and move east. Now, the next steps mentioned in the original instructions were to go south, lift the lettuce from the garden, then go north, venture west, and rest the lettuce on the stove.

But the current environment is the bedroom, and after opening the wooden door, the user is now in a new location. Wait, when they opened the wooden door, they must have moved into another room. The previous message shows that after opening the door, the score increased, so the player is now in a different area. The next step in the original plan was to go south, but the user might need to check the current room's description to see what's available.

Looking at the latest prompt, the user is in the bedroom again, but maybe the door opening led them to another room. However, the latest response after opening the door says "You open wooden door." So maybe the next step is to move east, but the user was told to go south next. Wait, the original instructions said after moving east, go south. But the user might have moved east already. Let me check the history.

Wait, the user's last action was "go east" which was denied because the door wasn't open. Then they opened the door, and now they're in a new room. The current location might be a different room, like a hallway or another room. The user needs to proceed according to the original plan: after opening the door, move east, then go south, etc.

But the user's next action should be to go south, as per the original instructions. However, the current room's description might not have a south direction. The user needs to check the available directions. But since the assistant can only output the command, the next step would be to go south. However, the user might need to first move east to the next room. Wait, the original plan was: after opening the door, move east, then go south. But the user might be in a room where moving south is possible. Alternatively, maybe the current room is the one leading to the garden.

Alternatively, maybe the user is in the bedroom, and after opening the door, they can move east to another room. But the original instructions said after moving east, go south. So the next step would be to go south. But the user needs to make sure they are in the correct room. Since the latest action was opening the door, the next step is to move east, then south. But the user's next action should be to go south. Wait, the original plan was: after moving east, go south. So after moving east, the user would be in a new room, then go south from there.

But the user's current location might be the room beyond the door. The user needs to check the available directions. However, the assistant can only output the command. The next step according to the original plan is to go south. So the correct command would be "go south".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in the TextWorld game. So far, they've opened the chest drawer, taken the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door leading east. Then they tried to go east, which worked. Now they're in a new location, probably the room beyond the door. The next step in their original plan was to go south, but they can't because the game says "You can't go that way." 

Hmm, so the user's next action after going east would be to move south, but that's not possible. So they need to figure out another way. Let me check the previous steps again. The original goal was to ensure the screen door is open, then move east, then go south, lift lettuce from the garden, go north, venture west, rest lettuce on stove, and win.

Wait, after opening the wooden door and going east, the user is now in a new room. The next step was to go south, but that's blocked. Maybe there's another direction they can go from the current location. Let me think about the possible commands. The user might need to check the available directions again. But since the game only allows certain actions, perhaps they need to look around for other options. Alternatively, maybe the screen door is in the current room, so they need to open it first. The user mentioned ensuring the screen door is open before moving east again. But they already moved east once. Maybe they need to go back west, open the screen door, then try moving east again. But the original plan was to move east, then south. Maybe the screen door is in the new room they're in, so they need to open it first. Alternatively, maybe the garden is accessible from here. But the lettuce is in the garden, so perhaps they need to go through the screen door to reach the garden. But the user's next step is to go south, which is blocked. So perhaps the correct action is to go west back to the bedroom, open the screen door, then proceed east again. But the user's last action was going east, so they are now in the east room. Let me check the game's current state. The user is in the east room (after opening the door), and trying to go south is not possible. So the next possible action is to look for other directions, maybe north, west, or check the screen door. But the user's original plan was to go south after moving east. Since that's not possible, maybe they need to find another way to proceed. Alternatively, maybe the screen door is in the east room, so they need to open it first. The user's next action should be to open the screen door if it's there. But the game's current state might not have a screen door. Wait, the original instructions mentioned ensuring the screen door is open. So perhaps the screen door is in the current room. So the user needs to open it. But how? The user might need to use the key again, but the key is already used. Alternatively, maybe the screen door is a separate entity. The user's next action should be to open the screen door. But the game might not have that option. Alternatively, maybe the user is in a room where the screen door is closed, so they need to open it. But the user's previous actions didn't mention that. So the correct next step is to open the screen door if it's present. But since the game's current state doesn't mention it, maybe the user needs to go back west, open the screen door, then proceed. But the user is in the east room now. So perhaps the next action is to go west back to the bedroom, then open the screen door. But the user's original plan was to go south after moving east. Since that's blocked, maybe the correct action is to go west. But the user's last action was go east, so they are in the east room. The possible directions from there might be north, west, or other. If the user can't go south, maybe they need to go west back to the bedroom. So the next action would be go west. But the user's original plan was to go south after moving east. So maybe there's a mistake in the steps. Alternatively, the user needs to check the current room's description for possible actions. But since the game's response after going east is just the current room, maybe the user needs to look around. However, the user is restricted to giving only the command. So the next action should be to go west back to the bedroom, then open the screen door. But the user's next action is to go west. However, the user's original plan was to go south after moving east. Since that's not possible, the user might need to adjust their steps. So the correct next action is to go west back to the bedroom, then open the screen door. But the user is in the east room now. So the next command is go west.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in the TextWorld game. They started by opening the chest drawer, taking the old key, unlocking the wooden door, and opening it. Then they tried to go south and west, but those directions aren't possible. Now, they need to proceed with the next steps from the original instructions.

The original plan after opening the door was to move east, then go south, lift the lettuce from the garden, go north, venture west, rest the lettuce on the stove, and win. But currently, the player is in the bedroom after opening the door. The available directions might be limited. Since going south and west aren't possible, maybe the next step is to check other directions or look for items. But the user's next action was to go east, which might be possible once the door is open. Wait, the user tried to go east after opening the door, but the game said they can't go that way. Maybe the door opening doesn't allow movement east yet. Alternatively, perhaps there's another path. The user needs to check the current room's description for possible actions. The bedroom has a king-size bed, an antique trunk, and the door. Maybe the lettuce is in another room, so after moving east (if possible), they can find it. But since going east isn't allowed, maybe they need to look elsewhere. Alternatively, maybe the screen door is mentioned in the original instructions, so they need to open that. The user hasn't done that yet. The original steps included ensuring the screen door is open. So perhaps the next action is to open the screen door. But the current room is the bedroom, so maybe the screen door is there. The user might need to check for that. However, the user's previous actions were focused on the door and the key. Since the user is stuck, maybe the next step is to look around again for other items or possible actions. But the user's last action was going west, which wasn't possible. The correct next step might be to check the screen door in the bedroom. So the command would be to open the screen door. But the user needs to make sure they're in the right place. Alternatively, maybe the lettuce is in the garden, so they need to move to the garden. But how? The original plan had moving east after opening the door, but that's not possible. Maybe there's a mistake in the game's logic, but the user has to follow the commands. The user's next action should be to open the screen door as per the original instructions.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in this text-based game. They started by opening the chest drawer, taking the key, unlocking the door, and opening it. Then they tried to go south and west, but those weren't possible. Now they're trying to open the screen door, but it's not there.

The original goal was to get the key, unlock the door, open it, move east, then go south, pick up lettuce, go north, west, and put the lettuce on the stove. But the current location is the bedroom. The user has already opened the door and is now in the room beyond the door? Or maybe they're still in the bedroom.

Wait, after opening the wooden door, they went east, but that might not be possible. The user tried to go south and west, which are not allowed. The screen door isn't in the bedroom, so opening it isn't an option. The next step might be to check the room they're in now. Maybe after opening the door, they're in a different room, like a hallway or another area. But the game's current state shows they're still in the bedroom. 

The user's next action should be to look around again to find the lettuce or the stove. But the instructions mention going to the garden, lifting lettuce, etc. Maybe the user needs to move to the garden. But how? The current room is the bedroom, and the only exit is east, which was blocked. Wait, after opening the door, maybe they can go east into another room. But the game says they can't go south or west. Maybe the screen door is in another part of the room. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to look for the lettuce in the bedroom, but the description says the bed has nothing. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go back to the chest drawer or check other objects. But the key is already taken. The next step might be to look for the lettuce in the garden, but how to get there. The user might need to find a way to move to the garden. Since the initial steps were in the bedroom, perhaps the garden is accessible through another door. But the user hasn't found it yet. 

Wait, the user's last action was trying to open the screen door, which isn't there. So maybe they need to look for the lettuce in the bedroom, but the description says there's nothing on the bed. Maybe the lettuce is in another part of the room. Alternatively, the user might need to go back to the chest drawer or check the antique trunk. But the trunk is mentioned as being there, but nothing is in it. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to move east after opening the door, but the game says they can't. So perhaps the correct action is to look around again for possible items or exits. The user might need to check the antique trunk again or the bed. But the problem is that the user is stuck in the bedroom with no clear path to the garden. 

The next logical step would be to look for the lettuce in the bedroom, but according to the game's description, there's nothing on the bed. Maybe the lettuce is in the garden, but the user hasn't found the way there yet. The user needs to find the correct path to the garden. Since they've already opened the door, maybe they can go east again, but the game says they can't. Maybe the door is blocked. Alternatively, the user might need to find another way. 

Wait, the user's score is at -4/14, which might indicate they've made some mistakes. The correct steps would be to open the door, then proceed east, then go south, etc. But the game is preventing movement. Maybe the user needs to check if they're in the right room. Alternatively, the user might need to use the key again or find another way. 

But according to the latest prompt, the user is in the bedroom, and the only possible exit is east, which is blocked. So maybe the next action is to look again for the lettuce, but it's not there. The user might need to find another way to get to the garden. Alternatively, the user might have to wait for the game to allow movement. But since the user is stuck, the next action should be to look around again or check the trunk. 

But the user's last action was trying to open the screen door, which isn't there. So the correct next action would be to look around for other items or possible exits. However, the user is instructed to only output the command. So the next action should be to look again, but the game might not accept that. Alternatively, the user might need to go back to the chest drawer. But the user has already taken the key. 

Hmm, maybe the user needs to go east again, even though the game says they can't. But the game is preventing that. Alternatively, the user might need to find the correct path. Since the user is stuck, the next action should be to look again, but the game might not allow that. The user might need to try a different command. 

Wait, the user's previous action was trying to open the screen door, which isn't there. The correct next step would be to look for the lettuce in the bedroom, but the game says there's nothing. So maybe the user is supposed to go to the garden through another route. But how? The user hasn't found the way yet. 

Alternatively, the user might need to go back to the chest drawer and check again, but that's already done. The user has the key and opened the door. The next step is to move east, but the game says they can't. So maybe the user is in a room where east is blocked, but the garden is accessible through another door. 

In this case, the user might need to look around again for possible exits. The correct command would be to look, but the user is supposed to only output the action. So the next action is to look again. But the game might not accept that. Alternatively, the user might need to try to go east again. 

But the game says they can't go that way. So the user is stuck. The next action should be to look again, but the user might need to find another way. However, the user is supposed to follow the original steps. The original steps after opening the door were to move east, then go south, etc. So the user is stuck because they can't move east. 

Therefore, the next action should be to go east again, even though the game says they can't. But the game is preventing that. So the user is in a loop. The correct answer is to go east, but the game says it's not possible. Maybe the user needs to find another way. 

Alternatively, the user might need to check the antique trunk again. But the trunk is empty. The user has already taken the key. So the next step is to look around again. The correct command is to look, but the user is supposed to output only the action. So the next action is to look.

-= Bedroom =-
You're now in the bedroom. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You can make out an opened chest drawer. The chest drawer is empty, what a horrible day! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than an antique trunk, so there's that. You scan the room, seeing a king-size bed. The king-size bed is typical. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

There is an open wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text adventure game, and they've been following a set of instructions to complete certain tasks. The current scenario is in the bedroom, and they've already managed to open the chest drawer, take the old key, unlock and open the wooden door east. Now, the next steps according to the original plan were to ensure the screen door is open, then move east, go south, lift the lettuce from the garden, go north, venture west, rest the lettuce on the stove, and then win.

But looking at the current state, the user is in the bedroom, and the wooden door east is open. The previous attempts to go south or west were unsuccessful. The user tried to open the screen door, but it wasn't there. Now, after looking around, the scene describes the bedroom again, with the chest drawer empty and the wooden door east open.

Wait, the original goal mentioned going to the garden, lifting lettuce, etc. But the current location is the bedroom. So maybe the next step is to move east through the open door to enter the next room, which might be the garden or another area. The user's next action should be to go east, but they tried that before and maybe couldn't. However, the door is now open, so perhaps they can go east now.

But in the latest response, after looking, the user is still in the bedroom. The available actions are probably to go east through the open door. The user might have tried going east before but maybe got stuck. Alternatively, maybe the screen door refers to a different door in another part of the house. But according to the current description, the only door mentioned is the wooden door east. The screen door might be a red herring or not present here.

So the next logical step is to go east through the open door. The user's previous attempt to go east was blocked, but now the door is open. So the correct action would be to go east. Let me check the previous messages. The user tried "go east" and was told they have to open the door first, but the door is already open. Wait, in the latest state, the door is open. So maybe the user can now go east. Therefore, the next command should be "go east".

You make out a refrigerator. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a counter, go to TextWorld. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Were you looking for a stove? Because look over there, it's a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? The stove appears to be empty. You move on, clearly infuriated by TextWorld. You scan the room for a kitchen island, and you find a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

Okay, let me try to figure out what the next step should be. The user's goal is to eventually rest the lettuce on the stove. So far, they've opened the chest drawer, taken the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, and moved east into the kitchen. Now, in the kitchen, they need to find the lettuce and then get it to the stove.

Looking at the current room description, the kitchen has a refrigerator, a counter, a stove, a kitchen island with a note, a screen door east, a wooden door west, and exits north, south. The user hasn't mentioned finding the lettuce yet. The original instructions said to "lift the lettuce from the floor of the garden" after going south, but the user is now in the kitchen. Wait, maybe there's a confusion here. The user's previous action was moving east into the kitchen, but the next step might involve going south from the kitchen to reach the garden where the lettuce is. However, the current room has an exit to the south. So maybe the next step is to go south from the kitchen to the garden, find the lettuce, then go north to the stove. But the user's next action should be to go south. However, the user's previous action was moving east, and now they're in the kitchen. The user's next action should be to go south to reach the garden. But the user's last command was "go east", which led them to the kitchen. Now, in the kitchen, the exits are north, south, east (screen door), west (wooden door). The user needs to go south to the garden. So the next command should be "go south". But the user's current score is 5/16, and they need to proceed towards the garden, lift the lettuce, then go north to the stove. So the next action is to go south.

You arrive in a living room. An ordinary kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a couch. Now why would someone leave that there? The couch is typical. On the couch you can see a milk. You see a low table. On the low table you can see a remote. You can see a tv. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked.

Okay, let's see. The user has to follow a series of steps to win the game. So far, they've opened the chest drawer, taken the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, and moved east into the kitchen. Then they went south to the living room.

The next steps in the original instructions were: after moving east, go to the south, then lift the lettuce from the floor of the garden, then go north, then venture west, rest the lettuce on the stove. But the current location is the living room. Wait, the user mentioned the garden later, but in the current scenario, they're in the living room. Maybe the garden is another room.

Wait, the user's previous action was going south from the kitchen to the living room. The next step in the original plan was to go south again? Or maybe after moving east (into the kitchen), then go south (which they did, leading to living room). Then the next step was to lift the lettuce from the garden. But the garden hasn't been mentioned yet. So perhaps the user needs to find the garden room.

But in the current room (living room), the description mentions a couch, a table, a TV, etc. No mention of a garden. So maybe the garden is another room. The user needs to find the garden, lift the lettuce there, then go north, west, etc.

But the user's next action should be to go north from the living room, as the exit to the north is unblocked. Let me check the living room description again. The living room has an exit to the north. So going north from here might lead to another room, perhaps the garden? Or maybe another part of the house.

Alternatively, maybe the garden is accessible through another door. But according to the current room (living room), the exits are north, south, west, and east. Wait, the living room's description says: "There is an unblocked exit to the north." So the user can go north from here. Let's assume that going north leads to the garden. Then the next step would be to go north, find the garden, lift the lettuce, then proceed as per the original plan.

But the user's next action should be to go north. So the command would be "go north".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in this text-based game. Their goal is to eventually rest the lettuce on the stove and win. So far, they've managed to open the chest drawer, get the old key, unlock the door, and move east into the kitchen. They've also been moving around between rooms, but they're stuck in a loop between the kitchen and living room.

The current location is the kitchen again, with the same description. The user's last action was going north, which brought them back to the kitchen. The next step in their original plan was to go to the south, but that led them to the living room. Now, they need to continue with the tasks mentioned: ensure the screen door is open, move east, go south, lift the lettuce from the garden, go north, venture west, and then rest the lettuce on the stove.

Wait, but the user hasn't mentioned the garden yet. The original instructions included going to the south, then lifting the lettuce from the garden. However, in the current game state, the user is in the kitchen. The garden isn't part of the current rooms described. Maybe the garden is another room they need to explore. But how?

Looking at the current room (kitchen), the exits are north, south, east (screen door), and west (open door). The user needs to find the garden. Perhaps the garden is accessible from the living room or another room. The user was in the living room earlier, but when they went north, they returned to the kitchen.

The next logical step might be to check the living room for the garden. But in the living room description, there's a couch, a milk, a remote, a TV, but no mention of a garden. Maybe the garden is in a different room. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west from the kitchen, which is the open wooden door. But that leads back to the bedroom. The bedroom doesn't mention a garden either.

Wait, the original plan was: after moving east (into the kitchen), go south (to living room), then lift the lettuce from the garden. But the garden isn't in the current rooms. Maybe the user needs to find a way to access the garden. Perhaps the garden is in the living room, but the description doesn't mention it. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go through the screen door east from the kitchen, but that's closed.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check the kitchen island for the note mentioned earlier. The note might have clues. But the user hasn't checked that yet. However, the user's last action was going north, which didn't help. So maybe the next step is to check the kitchen island for the note, but the user hasn't done that yet.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east to the screen door, open it, and proceed. But the screen door is closed. The user hasn't opened it yet. So perhaps the next step is to open the screen door east. But the user's previous attempts to open it were unsuccessful. However, in the kitchen, there's a closed screen door leading east. The user might need to open that.

Wait, the user's current score is 5/18. They need to continue with the tasks. The next step in the original plan was to ensure the screen door is open. So maybe the user needs to open the screen door east from the kitchen. Let me check the current room's description again. The kitchen has a closed screen door leading east. So the user needs to open that. But how? The user might need to use the key or some other method. But the key was used to unlock the wooden door. Maybe the screen door can be opened with the key, or perhaps there's another way.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west back to the bedroom, but that's already been done. The user's original plan was to move east, then go south, then lift the lettuce from the garden. But the garden isn't in the current rooms. This suggests that maybe the user is missing a step or the game has a different layout.

Alternatively, maybe the garden is in the living room, but the description doesn't mention it. The user might need to look more carefully. In the living room, there's a couch, a milk, a remote, a TV. No garden mentioned. So perhaps the user needs to find another way.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go north from the kitchen again, but that just loops back. The user might be stuck in a loop between kitchen and living room. The original plan was to go south from the kitchen to the living room, then lift the lettuce from the garden. But the garden isn't in the current rooms. This suggests that perhaps the user needs to find the garden through another route, maybe through the screen door east, but that's closed.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check the kitchen island for the note. The note might have a clue. The user hasn't checked that yet. The kitchen island has a note. So perhaps the next step is to check the kitchen island for the note. But the user hasn't done that yet. However, the user's last action was going north, which didn't help. So maybe the next step is to look around the kitchen for the note.

But the user's current location is the kitchen, and the note is on the kitchen island. So the user needs to check the kitchen island. However, the user hasn't done that yet. The user might need to look at the kitchen island. But how? The user's actions are limited to moving between rooms and interacting with objects. So maybe the next step is to look at the kitchen island to find the note, which might have a clue about the garden.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east to the screen door, open it, and proceed. But the screen door is closed. The user might need to find a way to open it. However, the user has the old key, which was used to unlock the wooden door. Maybe the screen door can be opened with the key. But the user hasn't tried that yet. So the next step might be to use the key on the screen door.

But the user's previous attempts to use the key on the door were unsuccessful. The user tried "use key on door" and "unlock door with key", but the game didn't accept those. The correct command might be "unlock screen door" or "open screen door". However, the user needs to try the correct command.

Alternatively, the user might need to go to the screen door and try to open it. The current room (kitchen) has a closed screen door leading east. So the user needs to open that. The correct command would be "open screen door" or "unlock screen door". The user might need to try that.

The current step mentioned is opening the screen door, which they just did. Now, according to the original instructions, after opening the screen door, they need to "make an attempt to move east." But in the previous steps, when they tried to go east from the kitchen, they ended up in the living room and then back to the kitchen. However, the screen door is now open, so maybe moving east from the kitchen through the screen door is the next logical step.

Wait, the user just opened the screen door, so the next action should be to go east through that door. But in the previous interaction, when they tried to go east from the kitchen, they went to the living room. But the screen door is leading east, so perhaps that's the correct path. However, the user's next action after opening the screen door is to attempt to move east. But in the game's current state, after opening the screen door, the user is in the kitchen, and the screen door is now open. So the next step would be to go east through the screen door. But the user might have already tried that and ended up in the living room. However, the original plan was to go east after opening the screen door. So the correct next action here is to go east again, through the screen door. But the user might need to check if that's possible. However, the game's response after opening the screen door just says "You open screen door" and then the next prompt is to say the next action. So the user should now try to go east, which would take them through the screen door to the next room. But in the previous steps, going east from the kitchen led to the living room. However, the user's original plan was to go east after opening the screen door. So the correct next action is "go east".

Okay, let's see. The user has been navigating through different rooms in the TextWorld game. Their goal is to follow a series of steps: open the chest drawer, take the old key, unlock the wooden door, open it, move east, then go south, pick up the lettuce from the garden, go north, venture west, rest the lettuce on the stove, and finally win.

So far, they've managed to open the chest drawer, take the key, unlock the door, open it, and move east to the kitchen. Then they went south to the living room, north back to the kitchen, opened the screen door, and went east to the backyard. Now, they're in the backyard. The next step in the original plan was to go south from the backyard. But the user's last action was going east to the backyard, and now they're here. The current room is the backyard, and the possible exits are west (screen door) and south (unblocked). 

The user's next action should be to go south from the backyard. That's part of the original plan: after moving east, go south. But wait, in the backyard, the south exit is unblocked. So the correct next step is to go south. The user hasn't yet reached the garden where the lettuce is, so going south from the backyard would take them to the next area, possibly the garden. Then they need to pick up the lettuce. After that, go north, venture west, rest the lettuce on the stove. 

But the user's current position is the backyard. The next step is to go south. So the command should be "go south". That's the next logical step after being in the backyard. The user has already done some steps correctly, and this seems like the right continuation.

So far, they've navigated through the bedroom, kitchen, living room, backyard, and now the garden. In the garden, there's a lettuce on the floor. The next step mentioned was to lift the lettuce.

The current location is the Garden, and the user needs to pick up the lettuce. The command should be "take lettuce" or "lift lettuce". But in TextWorld-style games, "take" is often the verb used for picking up items. So the correct command here would be "take lettuce". That's the next action needed to proceed towards the goal of resting it on the stove later.

Okay, the user has to follow a series of steps in the TextWorld game. Let me recap the current state.

First, they started in the bedroom, opened the chest drawer, got the old key, unlocked the door, and went east to the kitchen. Then they opened the screen door, went east to the backyard, then south to the garden. In the garden, they picked up the lettuce. Now, the next step according to the original instructions was to go north from the garden. But the user's last action was taking the lettuce. So the next command should be to go north. Let me check the previous messages to confirm.

Yes, the original plan was: after picking up the lettuce, go north, then venture west, then rest the lettuce on the stove. But in the current state, the user is in the garden. The garden's description says there's an exit to the north. So the next action should be "go north". Then, after reaching the next room (probably the kitchen or another area), they need to venture west and put the lettuce on the stove. But the immediate next step is to go north from the garden. So the correct command here is "go north".

Okay, let's see. The user has to follow a series of steps to win the game. So far, they've opened the chest drawer, taken the old key, unlocked the door, opened the screen door, went east to the backyard, then south to the garden where they took the lettuce, and then went north back to the backyard.

The next step in the original instructions was to "rest the lettuce on the stove." But the user is currently in the backyard. The stove is in the kitchen. So they need to go back to the kitchen from the backyard. The backyard has a screen door leading west back to the kitchen. So the next action should be to go west through the screen door. Then, once in the kitchen, they can go north to the kitchen island where the stove is. Then place the lettuce on the stove. But according to the game's current state, the user is in the backyard, so the immediate next step is to go west to the kitchen. Let me check the previous steps to make sure.

Yes, the last action was going north from the garden to the backyard. Now, the user needs to go west to the kitchen. Then, from the kitchen, they can go north to the kitchen island and put the lettuce on the stove. But the current prompt says to only output the next command. So the next action is to go west.

GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Kitchen =-
You've come into an ordinary room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be ordinary. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the kitchen. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You make out a refrigerator. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a counter, go to TextWorld. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Were you looking for a stove? Because look over there, it's a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? The stove appears to be empty. You move on, clearly infuriated by TextWorld. You scan the room for a kitchen island, and you find a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

Okay, let's see. The user has to follow a series of steps in the TextWorld game. So far, they've managed to open the chest drawer, get the old key, unlock the door, open the screen door, and even pick up the lettuce in the garden. Now they're in the kitchen again after going west from the backyard.

The next step according to the original plan was to rest the lettuce on the stove. But the user is currently in the kitchen. The stove is mentioned in the kitchen description, so the next logical step would be to go to the stove. However, the user needs to first ensure they have the lettuce. Since they just picked up the lettuce in the garden, they should carry it with them. 

Wait, in the game, when you pick up an item, you're holding it. So the user has the lettuce. Now they need to go to the stove. The kitchen has a stove, so the command should be to go to the stove. But the game might require specific commands like 'go to stove' or 'go to the stove'. Alternatively, maybe 'go north' again if the stove is in that direction. But looking at the kitchen description, the exits are north, south, west, and east. The stove is mentioned as being in the kitchen, so the user needs to move to the stove's location. However, the game's current location is the kitchen, so perhaps the stove is in the same room. Wait, the kitchen description says "you can see a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? The stove appears to be empty." So the stove is in the kitchen. Therefore, the user is already in the kitchen, so they can directly go to the stove. But the game might require the command 'go to stove' or 'go to the stove'. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go north again to reach the stove, but that's not clear. 

Wait, the user's current location is the kitchen. The stove is in the kitchen. So the next step is to go to the stove. But the game might not allow 'go to stove' directly. Maybe the correct command is 'go to stove' or 'go to the stove'. Alternatively, since the user is holding the lettuce, they can try to put it on the stove. But the game might require them to first go to the stove's location. However, in the kitchen description, the stove is present, so the user can directly interact with it. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go north again to reach the stove. But in the kitchen description, the exits are north, south, west, and east. The stove is in the kitchen, so the user is already there. Therefore, the correct command would be to go to the stove. But the game might not accept that. Alternatively, the user can try to put the lettuce on the stove. But the game might require them to first go to the stove's location. 

Wait, the original goal was to rest the lettuce on the stove. So the user has the lettuce, is in the kitchen, and the stove is in the kitchen. Therefore, the next step is to put the lettuce on the stove. But the game might require the command 'put lettuce on stove' or similar. However, the user's previous actions have been 'go east', 'go west', etc., so maybe the correct command here is 'put lettuce on stove'. But the user needs to check if that's allowed. 

Alternatively, the user might need to go to the stove's location first. But since the stove is in the kitchen, and the user is already there, they can directly interact with it. So the next action should be to put the lettuce on the stove. However, the game might require the command 'put lettuce on stove'. Let me check the previous commands. The user has been using 'go east', 'go west', 'take lettuce', etc. So the next step is to put the lettuce on the stove. Therefore, the correct command is 'put lettuce on stove'.
