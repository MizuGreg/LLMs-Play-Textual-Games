-= Bedroom =-
You've entered a bedroom.

You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a chest drawer! You make out a closed antique trunk in the room. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a king-size bed. The king-size bed is normal. But there isn't a thing on it.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me see. The user is playing this text-based game and has already opened the chest drawer in the bedroom, which revealed an old key. The next steps according to the initial instructions were to recover the old key from the chest drawer, then unlock the wooden door inside the bedroom with that key, check if the door is ajar, then go east, open the refrigerator, get the tomato plant, put it on the stove, and win.

Wait, the user just opened the chest drawer and found the key. So the next step should be to take the key. The instruction says "recover the old key from the chest drawer within the bedroom." So after opening the drawer, the key is inside, so the next action should be to take the key. Then, use that key to unlock the wooden door. But the current prompt shows that the wooden door is closed. So after taking the key, the user needs to unlock the door. Then check if it's ajar. Then go east. Then proceed with the fridge and tomato plant.

But the user's last action was opening the chest drawer. The next step is to take the key. So the correct command here is "take old key" or "take key". But in the game's context, maybe the exact wording matters. The initial instruction says "recover the old key from the chest drawer", so the action would be to take it. So the next command should be "take old key".

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game where they need to follow a series of steps to win. So far, they've opened the chest drawer in the bedroom, found an old key, and taken it. The next step according to the original instructions was to check that the wooden door inside the bedroom is unlocked with the old key. 

Wait, the current location is the bedroom. The user has the old key. The next action should be to unlock the wooden door. But how do you unlock it? In text adventures, usually, you use the key to unlock something. So the command would be "unlock wooden door with old key" or something similar. But the game might have specific commands. Let me check the previous interactions.

In the initial problem, the user was told to "check that the wooden door inside the bedroom is unlocked with the old key." So maybe after taking the key, the next step is to try unlocking the door. The user has already taken the key, so now they need to use it on the door. The door is closed, but the user needs to unlock it. So the correct command would be "unlock wooden door with old key". But I need to make sure that's the exact syntax the game expects. Since the user previously used "open chest drawer", which worked, maybe the command here is "unlock wooden door with old key". Alternatively, maybe "use old key on wooden door" or "unlock door with old key".

But the user's previous action was "take old key", and the next step is to unlock the door. The game's prompt says to check that the door is unlocked with the key. So the next action should be to unlock the door. Therefore, the correct command is "unlock wooden door with old key".

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps to open the chest drawer, take the key, unlock the door, and now the next step is to check if the door is ajar. The original goal mentioned opening the door and then moving east, then opening the fridge, getting the tomato plant, putting it on the stove, and winning.

So after unlocking the door, the next logical step would be to check if it's unlocked. But the user's last action was unlocking the door. The next instruction in the original plan was to "look and see that the wooden door inside the bedroom is ajar." Wait, but the door was already unlocked. Maybe the action here is to open the door? Or check if it's ajar. But the user has to follow the exact steps given.

Looking back at the original instructions: After unlocking the door, the next step is to check that it's ajar. So the next action should be to open the door, which would make it ajar. Alternatively, maybe the door is already open. Wait, the initial description said there's a closed wooden door leading east. Then after unlocking, the next step is to open it. So the next action would be to open the door. Then, once it's open, proceed east. Then open the fridge, etc.

So the next command should be "open wooden door" to make it ajar. Then proceed east. So the user's next action is to open the door.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps to solve the TextWorld game. So far, they've opened the chest drawer, taken the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door east. Now, the next step according to the original instructions was to head east after opening the door. But the user hasn't done that yet.

Wait, the previous action was opening the wooden door, which was leading east. So now, the next logical step would be to move east. The user's next action should be "go east" to proceed into the next room. The score is at 4/5, so they're close. The next steps after entering the east room would be to open the refrigerator, get the tomato plant, put it on the stove, and win. So currently, the focus is on moving east to access the refrigerator. Therefore, the correct command here is "go east".

-= Kitchen =-
You're now in the kitchen.

You make out a refrigerator. You make out a counter. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a stove. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You make out a kitchen island. The kitchen island is standard. On the kitchen island you make out a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

Okay, the user has to follow a series of steps to win the game. So far, they've opened the chest drawer, taken the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door in the bedroom, then went east to the kitchen. The next step in the original plan was to open the refrigerator. The user is now in the kitchen, and the refrigerator is mentioned as a closed object. The score is at 5/6, so the next action should be to open the refrigerator. Let me check the previous steps again to make sure. Yes, the instructions said after going east, open the refrigerator. So the correct command here is "open refrigerator".

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps to solve the text adventure game. So far, they've opened the chest drawer in the bedroom, taken the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door leading east, which took them to the kitchen. In the kitchen, they opened the refrigerator, took the tomato plant, and now they need to rest the tomato plant on the stove.

The next step according to the original instructions was to rest the tomato plant on the stove after taking it from the refrigerator. The user's last action was taking the tomato plant, so the next logical step is to place it on the stove. The stove is mentioned in the kitchen description, so they need to go there and put the plant down. The command should be "put tomato plant on stove". Let me check if there are any other steps or if that's the final action. The original goal was to rest the tomato plant on the stove and then win. So yes, that's the next action.
