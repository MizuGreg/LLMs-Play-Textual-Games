You are now playing a life changing session of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First thing I need you to do is to assure that the chest drawer in the bedroom is open. Then, retrieve the old key from the chest drawer in the bedroom. After that, unlock the wooden door with the old key. And then, ensure that the wooden door in the bedroom is open. After that, make an attempt to move east. Following that, open the refrigerator. And then, pick up the apple from the refrigerator. After that, rest the apple on the stove. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Bedroom =-
You are in a bedroom. A normal one. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You make out a chest drawer. You can make out an antique trunk. You smell a wretched smell, and follow it to a king-size bed. The king-size bed is standard. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me see. The user is playing this TextWorld game, and they've already opened the chest drawer in the bedroom and found the old key. The next steps according to the original task were to unlock the wooden door with the key, ensure the door is open, try to move east, open the refrigerator, pick up the apple, rest it on the stove, and then win.

So after opening the chest drawer, the next logical step would be to use the old key to unlock the wooden door. The user mentioned that the wooden door is closed and leads east. So the next action should be to unlock it. But wait, in TextWorld, sometimes you need to first open the door before you can unlock it, but the user's instruction says to unlock the door with the key. So maybe the correct command is to use the key on the door. But the user's previous action was "open chest drawer", and now the next step is to retrieve the key, which they did. Now they need to unlock the door. The command would be "unlock wooden door with old key" or something similar. But the game might require specific syntax. Let me check the previous commands. The user's first action was "open chest drawer", which worked. Then the next step is to unlock the door. The correct command here would be "unlock wooden door with old key". But maybe the game expects "use old key on wooden door" or "unlock wooden door". Since the key is already retrieved, the next step is to unlock the door. So the next action should be to unlock the wooden door with the old key. Then, after that, ensure the door is open, then move east. So the next command is "unlock wooden door with old key".

Okay, let me figure out what to do next. The user tried to unlock the wooden door with the old key, but the game said they need to take the key first. Wait, maybe the key is still in the chest drawer. So first, I should open the chest drawer again to get the key. Then, take the key. Then, use it to unlock the door. Let me check the previous steps.

Earlier, the user opened the chest drawer and found the old key. But maybe the key wasn't picked up yet. So the next step is to take the old key from the chest drawer. Then, unlock the door. Let me make sure. The game message said "You need to take the old key first," which might mean the key is in the chest drawer and hasn't been taken yet. So the correct action is to take the key. Then, unlock the door. So the next command should be "take old key".

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game where they need to follow a series of steps to win. The current situation is that they've opened the chest drawer, found the old key, taken it, and now they need to unlock the wooden door.

Wait, the previous step was taking the old key, so the next logical step would be to unlock the door. But the user just tried to unlock the door with the key. However, the system message said "You need to take the old key first," which might have been a mistake. But since the user already took the key, the next action should be to unlock the door. Let me check the previous messages again.

The user first opened the chest drawer, found the key, took it. Then the system said "You take the old key from the chest drawer." So now, the next step is to unlock the wooden door. The user's next action should be to unlock the door with the key. But the system might require the exact command. The original instruction said "unlock the wooden door with the old key." So the correct command here is "unlock wooden door with old key." But the user might need to use the key first. Wait, but they already have the key. So the next step is to unlock the door. The user's last action was taking the key, so the next action is to unlock the door. The system might accept "unlock wooden door" if the key is in hand. But the original instruction specified using the old key. So the correct command is "unlock wooden door with old key." But the user might have to use the key. Let me make sure. The previous error was when the user tried to unlock the door without the key, but since they have the key now, the correct action is to unlock the door with the key. So the next command should be "unlock wooden door with old key."

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps to open the chest drawer, get the key, unlock the door, and now the door is unlocked. The next step according to the original task was to ensure the wooden door is open. Since they just unlocked it, maybe they need to check if it's open. But the game might automatically consider it open after unlocking. Then, the next step was to move east. So the next action should be moving east. Let me confirm the previous steps again.

The user's last action was unlocking the door, which succeeded. The next step in the task was to "ensure that the wooden door in the bedroom is open." But since they just unlocked it, perhaps they need to open it further or check its state. However, in many text adventures, unlocking a door implies it's now open. So the next step would be moving east as instructed. The user's next action should be "go east" or "move east." The system might accept "go east" as the command. So the correct next action is to move east.

Okay, let's see. The user tried to go east but the wooden door wasn't open. They had already unlocked the door, but maybe it's not open yet. Wait, the previous step was unlocking the door, but maybe the action required is to open it. The game might need the door to be opened before moving east. So the next logical step is to open the wooden door again. Let me check the previous interactions.

The user had the wooden door unlocked, but maybe it's still closed. The error message says "You have to open the wooden door first." So even though they unlocked it, they need to open it. So the correct action now is to open the door. Then, after that, they can go east. So the next command should be "open wooden door".

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps to open the chest drawer, get the key, unlock the door, and now they've opened the wooden door. The next step in the original task was to open the refrigerator. So after opening the door, they should move into the next room, which is probably the kitchen or something similar. But since the user is in the bedroom and just opened the door east, maybe the next step is to go east to access the refrigerator.

Wait, the previous action was opening the wooden door, which leads east. So the next logical step is to go east to enter that room. But the user's next action should be to open the refrigerator. However, the user might need to check if they are in the correct location. Let me check the original instructions again.

The task says: after opening the wooden door, make an attempt to move east. Then open the refrigerator. So after opening the door, they need to move east. But the user just opened the door, so they need to go east. Then, once in the new room, open the refrigerator. So the next action should be "go east" again. But the user might have already done that. Wait, the last action was opening the door, so the next step is to go east. Then, once in the new room, open the refrigerator. So the next command should be "go east".

Ah, the kitchen. This is some kind of kitchen, really great standard vibes in this place, a wonderful standard atmosphere. And now, well, you're in it.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a refrigerator. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. The counter appears to be empty. You see a stove. The stove is usual. But there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is standard. On the kitchen island you see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

Okay, let's see. The user has been through the bedroom, opened the chest drawer, got the key, unlocked the door, and went east into the kitchen. The current location is the kitchen. The next steps according to the original plan were to open the refrigerator, pick up the apple, rest it on the stove, and then win.

Looking at the kitchen description, there's a refrigerator that's closed. The user needs to open it first. The next action should be to open the refrigerator. Then, after that, they can pick up the apple. So the immediate next command is "open refrigerator".

Okay, the user has to pick up the apple from the refrigerator. The previous action was opening the refrigerator, which revealed a milk and an apple. So the next logical step is to take the apple.

No other steps are needed here. Just take the apple.

Okay, the user tried to "rest apple on stove" but the system said that's not a recognized verb. So I need to figure out the correct command. Let me think about the possible actions in the kitchen.

The user has the apple in hand. The goal is to rest the apple on the stove. The correct verb here might be "put" instead of "rest". So the command should be "put apple on stove". Let me check if that's the right phrasing. Yes, "put" is the standard verb for placing something down. So the next action should be "put apple on stove".
