Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, you could, like, doublecheck that the antique trunk is open. And then, retrieve the old key from the antique trunk. After that, make sure that the wooden door in the bedroom is unlocked. Then, open the wooden door. After that, make an attempt to move east. And then, make it so that the refrigerator in the kitchen is ajar. And then, take the bell pepper from the refrigerator. Then, place the bell pepper on the stove. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Bedroom =-
Well, here we are in a bedroom.

You can see a closed chest drawer in the room. You see an antique trunk. You scan the room, seeing a king-size bed. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The king-size bed is standard. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me see. The user wants me to follow a series of steps in the TextWorld game. So far, I've opened the antique trunk and found the old key. The next step was to make sure the wooden door in the bedroom is unlocked. Wait, the current location is the bedroom, and there's a closed wooden door leading east. So I need to unlock that door first.

But how do I unlock it? The key from the trunk might be needed. Maybe I should use the key on the door. Let me check the previous steps again. The user mentioned retrieving the old key from the trunk, so I have that now. The next action should be to unlock the wooden door. So the command would be "unlock wooden door". But I need to make sure that's the correct action here. Alternatively, maybe the door is locked, so I need to use the key to unlock it. Let me confirm the current state: the wooden door is closed and leading east. So the next step is to unlock it, then open it. Then move east. But the user's instructions say after unlocking the door, open it. So first, unlock, then open. But in the game, maybe "unlock" is a separate action from "open". So I should first try to unlock the door with the key. Then, once unlocked, open it. So the next action is to unlock the wooden door.

Okay, let's see. The user has to follow a series of steps in the TextWorld game. So far, they've opened the antique trunk and retrieved the old key. Then they tried to unlock the wooden door in the bedroom, but the door is fixed in place. The next step according to the original instructions was to open the wooden door. But since it's fixed, maybe they need to find a way to unlock it. Wait, they have the key from the trunk. Maybe using the key on the door?

Wait, the user's previous action was "unlock wooden door", but the response was that the door is fixed. So perhaps the door is locked, and the key is needed to unlock it. But the user already has the key. So maybe the next step is to use the key on the door. But the command would be "use key on wooden door" or something similar. However, in TextWorld, the commands are usually more straightforward. Maybe "unlock wooden door with key"? But the system might expect a specific command. Alternatively, since the door is fixed, maybe they need to push it or find another way. But the original plan was to open the door after unlocking it. So the next logical step is to use the key to unlock the door. Let me check the previous steps again.

Original steps: open trunk, get key, unlock door, open door, move east, open fridge, take bell pepper, put on stove. So after getting the key, the next step was to unlock the door. But the door is fixed. So maybe the key is needed to unlock it. So the correct command would be to use the key on the door. But the user tried "unlock wooden door" and it didn't work. So perhaps the correct command is "use key on wooden door" or "unlock wooden door with key". But the system might accept "unlock wooden door" if the key is in hand. Wait, the user has the key, so maybe the correct action is to unlock the door. But the system said the door is fixed. Maybe the door is locked, and the key is needed. So the next action should be to unlock the door with the key. So the command would be "unlock wooden door" again, but maybe the system requires using the key. Alternatively, maybe the door is locked, and the key is needed to unlock it. So the correct command is "use key on wooden door". But the user has to input the correct command. Let me think. The user's last action was "unlock wooden door", which didn't work. So maybe the correct action is to use the key on the door. So the next command should be "use key on wooden door". But the system might expect "unlock wooden door" again. Alternatively, maybe the door is locked, and the key is needed. So the user needs to use the key to unlock it. Therefore, the next action is "use key on wooden door".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in the TextWorld game. So far, they've opened the antique trunk and found an old key. Then they tried to unlock the wooden door, but the system didn't recognize "unlock" as a verb. Next, they tried "use key on wooden door", which also didn't work.

Hmm, the problem here is probably with the correct commands. In TextWorld, you often have to use specific verbs. The user might need to "unlock" the door first, but since that didn't work, maybe the correct verb is "open" or "use" the key on the door. But the system said "use key on wooden door" wasn't recognized. Maybe the correct command is "unlock wooden door" instead. Wait, but the user tried that earlier and got an error. Alternatively, maybe the key is supposed to be used on the door, but the correct syntax is different.

Wait, the user is in the Bedroom, and the wooden door is closed. The key is in the trunk. So the correct action would be to use the key on the door to unlock it. But the system didn't accept "use key on wooden door". Maybe the correct command is "unlock wooden door" with the key. Or perhaps the key is already in the inventory, so the user needs to use it on the door. But the system might require a specific verb. Maybe "open" the door after unlocking. But the user tried "unlock" and it didn't work. Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "use key on door" without specifying "wooden". But the door is described as "wooden door", so maybe the correct command is "use key on wooden door".

Wait, the system said "That's not a verb I recognise" when the user tried "unlock wooden door". So maybe "unlock" isn't a valid verb here. Maybe the correct verb is "open" or "use". But the user tried "use key on wooden door" and got an error. So maybe the correct command is "unlock door" without specifying "wooden", but the door is in the room. Alternatively, maybe the key is supposed to be used on the door, but the correct syntax is "use key on door".

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to first pick up the key from the trunk, but they already opened the trunk and found the key. So the key is in their inventory. Then, the next step is to use the key on the door. But the system didn't accept "use key on wooden door". Maybe the correct command is "unlock door" with the key. But the system might require the exact phrase. Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "open door" after using the key. But the door is closed, so maybe "unlock" is needed first.

Wait, the user's previous action was "unlock wooden door", which the system didn't recognize. So maybe the correct verb is "open" instead of "unlock". But the door is locked, so maybe "unlock" is necessary. But the system is not recognizing it. Maybe the correct command is "use key on door". Let me think. The key is in the inventory, so the user needs to use it on the door. The correct command might be "use key on door" or "unlock door". But the system said "use key on wooden door" wasn't recognized. Maybe the correct command is "unlock door" without the "wooden" part. But the door is described as "wooden door", so maybe the system expects "wooden door" in the command.

Alternatively, maybe the correct action is to "open" the door, but since it's locked, that's not possible. So the user needs to unlock it first. But the system isn't accepting "unlock". Maybe the correct verb is "open" the door, but that's not possible unless it's unlocked. So perhaps the user needs to use the key on the door to unlock it. But the system is not recognizing "use key on wooden door". Maybe the correct command is "use key on door". Let's try that.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to unlock the wooden door in the bedroom. They already tried using the key on the door, but the game didn't recognize it. The previous attempt was "use key on door," which was invalid.

Hmm, maybe the correct command is to "unlock the door" instead. But the user might need to use the key first. Wait, the key is in the antique trunk, which they already opened. So the key is probably in their inventory now.

In text adventures, sometimes you have to use the key to unlock something. The correct command might be "unlock door with key" or "use key to unlock door." But the game might expect a different phrasing. Maybe "unlock door" if the key is already equipped. Alternatively, "open door" if the key is used to unlock it.

Wait, the user tried "use key on door" and it didn't work. Maybe the correct command is "unlock door" without specifying the key. Or perhaps "open door" if the key is used to unlock it. Let me think about common commands in such games. Usually, "unlock door" is a direct command. Let me check the previous steps again.

The user has the key from the antique trunk. The door is closed. So the next logical step is to unlock the door. The correct command is likely "unlock door." Let me try that.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to unlock the wooden door in the bedroom. They have an old key from the antique trunk. The previous attempt was to use the key on the door, but the system didn't recognize it. Now, the system is asking what they want to unlock the door with.

So, the key is in the trunk, and the user has already opened the trunk. The next logical step is to use the key to unlock the door. The error message suggests that the command might not be correctly formatted. Maybe the correct command is "unlock door with key" or "use key on door". But the system said "That's not a verb I recognise" when they tried "use key on door". 

Wait, maybe the correct command is just "unlock door" since the key is already in hand. But the system might require specifying the key. Alternatively, maybe the key is already in the inventory, so the user can just try to unlock the door with it. The previous attempt was "use key on door", which didn't work. Maybe the correct command is "unlock door with key". But the system might not accept that. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to first pick up the key, but they already have it from opening the trunk.

Wait, the user opened the trunk and found the key. So the key is in their inventory. The next step is to use it on the door. The correct command might be "unlock door" if the key is already equipped. But the system might require the key to be specified. Alternatively, maybe the command is "use key on door". But the system said that wasn't recognized. Maybe the correct command is "unlock door with key". Let me check the previous messages.

In the previous interaction, the user tried "use key on door" and got an error. Then they tried "unlock door" and got "What do you want to unlock wooden door with?" So the system is prompting for the object to use. So the correct command would be to specify the key. So the next action should be "unlock door with key". But the user has to input that. However, the system might not accept that. Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "use key on door". But the system said that wasn't recognized. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the correct command is just "unlock door", assuming the key is in hand. But the system is asking for what to unlock with. So the user needs to specify the key. Therefore, the next action should be "unlock door with key". But the user has to input that. However, the system might not accept that. Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "use key on door". But the system said that wasn't recognized. Maybe the correct command is "unlock door" and the system is expecting the key to be in the inventory. But the system is prompting for the object.

Since the key is needed to unlock the door, perhaps the correct command is "use key on door." But the system said that's not recognized.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to unlock the wooden door in the bedroom. They have the old key from the antique trunk. The previous attempts to use the key didn't work because the game didn't recognize the command. The user tried "use key on door" and "unlock door with key", but the system kept prompting for the correct command.

The key here is that the correct action should be to take the key first, then use it to unlock the door. But the user already took the key from the trunk. Wait, maybe the key isn't in their inventory yet. Let me check the previous steps. The user opened the antique trunk and found the old key. The next step was to unlock the door, but they didn't take the key first. Oh, right! The game might require taking the key into inventory before using it. So the correct sequence is: take the key, then unlock the door with it. But the user didn't take the key yet. So the next action should be to take the key first. Wait, but the user already did that? Let me check the history. The user said "open antique trunk" which revealed the key. Then the next action was "unlock wooden door", which failed. Then the system said "You need to take the old key first." So the user hasn't taken the key yet. So the correct next step is to take the key from the trunk. But the user might have already done that. Wait, the user's first action was to open the trunk, which revealed the key. But maybe the key is still in the trunk and needs to be picked up. So the next step is to take the key from the trunk. Then, after taking it, use it to unlock the door. So the correct command here is "take old key" or "take key". But the game might require specific wording. The user tried "use key on door" which didn't work. The system said "You need to take the old key first." So the user hasn't taken the key yet. Therefore, the next action should be to take the key from the trunk. The correct command would be "take old key" or "take key". But the game might have specific verbs.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in the TextWorld game. So far, they've opened the antique trunk, retrieved the old key, and tried to unlock the wooden door. But there was some confusion with the commands. The user tried "use key on door" which wasn't recognized, then "unlock door" which asked for the key. Then they took the key, and now they have it.

The next step according to the original instructions was to unlock the wooden door. Since the user now has the key, they need to use it on the door. The correct command here would be to unlock the door with the key. But in the game's context, maybe the command is "unlock door with key" or "use key on door". However, previous attempts showed that "use key on door" wasn't recognized. The game might expect a different phrasing. Alternatively, maybe "unlock door" is the command, and the key is already in hand. But the system message said "You need to take the old key first," so the user had to take it. Now that they have it, they need to use it on the door.

Looking at the previous interaction, when the user tried "use key on door", the game said it wasn't recognized. Then when they tried "unlock door", it asked what they wanted to unlock with. So maybe the correct command is "unlock door with key". But the user might need to use the key on the door. Alternatively, the game might accept "unlock door" if the key is in hand. But since the user had to take the key first, now they can use it. The next logical step is to unlock the door with the key. So the correct command would be "unlock door with key". But I need to check if that's the right syntax. Alternatively, maybe "use key on door" is the correct command, but the game didn't recognize it before. Maybe the user needs to use the key on the door. So the next action should be "use key on door". But the user tried that and got an error. Wait, maybe the correct command is "unlock door" and the key is already in hand. But the game might require specifying the key. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "unlock door" and the key is used automatically. But the previous error said "What do you want to unlock wooden door with?" so the user needs to specify the key. Therefore, the correct command is "unlock door with key". But the user might have to use the key on the door. So the next action is "unlock door with key".

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the instructions step by step. They started by opening the antique trunk and retrieving the old key. Then they tried to unlock the wooden door, but there was some confusion with the commands. After taking the key, they successfully unlocked the door.

Now, the next step in the original instructions was to "make an attempt to move east." So after unlocking the door, the next logical step would be to try moving east. The user is in the bedroom, and the door leads east. So the correct command here would be "go east" or "move east." Since the game might expect a specific verb, "go east" is more likely. The user should try that command now.

Okay, the user is trying to follow a series of steps in the TextWorld game. Let me recap the current situation. They started by opening the antique trunk and retrieving the old key. Then they tried to unlock the wooden door, but there was some confusion with the commands. After taking the key, they successfully unlocked the door. Now, they tried to go east, but the game reminded them that the door hasn't been opened yet.

Wait, the user just tried "go east" but the system responded that the door needs to be opened first. So the next logical step is to open the door again. But the user already unlocked it earlier. Let me check the previous steps. Oh, right, after unlocking the door, the next action was "go east", but the system said the door needs to be opened. Maybe there's a misunderstanding between unlocking and opening. In some games, unlocking a door is different from opening it. So even though they unlocked it, they might need to open it physically. Alternatively, maybe the door is locked and needs to be unlocked, but the user already did that. Hmm.

Wait, looking back: the user tried "unlock door with key" and it worked. Then they tried "go east" but the system said they have to open the door first. So maybe the door is locked, and even though they unlocked it, they need to open it. Or perhaps the door is in a state where it's unlocked but not open. So the correct action now is to open the door. But how? The user might need to use the key again, but that's already done. Alternatively, maybe the door is closed and needs to be opened, but the key was used to unlock it. So the next step is to open the door. But the user can't "open" the door directly; maybe they need to use the key again. Wait, but the key was already used to unlock it. Maybe the door is now unlocked but still closed, so the user needs to push it open. But in TextWorld, the commands are limited. The user might need to "open wooden door" instead of "go east". But the system is prompting them to go east, but the door is still closed. So the correct action is to open the door first. But how? The user might have to use the key again, but that's not necessary. Alternatively, maybe the door is locked and needs to be unlocked again. Wait, but the user already unlocked it. This is confusing. Let me check the previous interactions again.

The user tried "unlock door with key" and it worked. Then they tried "go east", but the system said they need to open the door. So the door is unlocked but not open. Therefore, the next step is to open the door. But how? The command might be "open wooden door". However, in the game's context, maybe the door is closed and needs to be opened. So the user should try "open wooden door" next. But the user's last action was "go east", which failed. So the correct next step is to open the door. Therefore, the user should type "open wooden door".

Okay, let's see. The user has to follow a series of steps in the TextWorld game. So far, they've opened the antique trunk, retrieved the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door leading east. Now they're in the next room, which is probably the kitchen since the next task is to make the refrigerator ajar.

Wait, the user's last action was opening the wooden door, which took them from the bedroom to the kitchen. The next step in the original instructions was to make the refrigerator in the kitchen ajar. So the next command should be "open refrigerator" or "ajar refrigerator". But in TextWorld, the correct verb might be "open" or "unlock". However, the user's previous actions involved using the key to unlock the door, so maybe "open" is the right verb here.

But the user's next action after opening the door would be to interact with the refrigerator. The instruction says "make the refrigerator in the kitchen ajar", so the correct command is likely "open refrigerator". Let me check the previous interactions. The user tried "use key on door" which didn't work, but after taking the key, they unlocked the door. So for the refrigerator, the correct action is probably "open refrigerator". 

Wait, but the user is in the kitchen now. The next step is to open the refrigerator. So the next command should be "open refrigerator". Then, after that, take the bell pepper from it. So the next action after opening the fridge is "take bell pepper from refrigerator". Then place it on the stove. But the user's current step is to make the fridge ajar, so the immediate next action is "open refrigerator".

So far, they've opened the antique trunk, retrieved the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door leading east. Now they're in the next room, probably the kitchen since the next task was to make the refrigerator ajar.

But the user tried to "open refrigerator" and got a response that there's no such thing. Hmm. Maybe the refrigerator isn't in the current room. Let me check the original instructions again. The user was told to "make sure that the wooden door in the bedroom is unlocked. Then, open the wooden door. After that, make an attempt to move east. And then, make it so that the refrigerator in the kitchen is ajar. And then, take the bell pepper from the refrigerator."

So after moving east (which they did by opening the door), they should be in the kitchen. But the problem is that the user is in the bedroom, so maybe they didn't move east yet. Wait, the user tried to open the refrigerator but couldn't because they were still in the bedroom. So the next step should be to move east first, then go to the kitchen, then open the refrigerator.

Wait, the user just opened the wooden door and moved east? Or did they? Let me check the history. The last action was "open wooden door", which was successful, and the score increased. Then the user tried to "open refrigerator" but it wasn't there. So maybe the user is still in the bedroom, and the kitchen is east of the bedroom. So after opening the door, they need to go east to reach the kitchen. Then, once in the kitchen, they can try to open the refrigerator.

So the correct next step is to "go east" again to move into the kitchen. Then, once in the kitchen, they can attempt to open the refrigerator. So the user's next action should be "go east" to move to the kitchen, then proceed to open the refrigerator.

Well, here we are in a kitchen. Let's see what's in here.

You make out a refrigerator. You see a counter. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You can make out a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You make out a kitchen island. The kitchen island is typical. On the kitchen island you can make out a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

Okay, let me figure out what to do next. The user's goal was to retrieve the bell pepper from the refrigerator in the kitchen. So far, they've opened the antique trunk, gotten the key, unlocked the bedroom door, opened the door, and now they're in the kitchen. The refrigerator is mentioned here, but it's not clear if it's open or closed. The user needs to make the refrigerator ajar, then take the bell pepper.

Looking at the current scene in the kitchen, the refrigerator is mentioned as a possible object. The user's next step should be to open the refrigerator. But in the previous attempt, when they tried "open refrigerator", the game said they couldn't see it. Wait, maybe the refrigerator is closed. So the correct action would be to open it. But the user just tried "open refrigerator" and got a message saying they can't see it. Maybe the refrigerator is closed, so they need to open it first. But how? Maybe the correct command is "open refrigerator" again, but the game might have a different way. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the correct verb. Let me check the previous steps again.

Wait, in the kitchen description, the refrigerator is mentioned as "a refrigerator. You see a counter... You can make out a stove...". The user's task is to make the refrigerator ajar. So the next step is to open the refrigerator. The user tried "open refrigerator" but got a message saying they can't see it. Maybe the refrigerator is closed, so they need to open it. But the game might require the correct command. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use "open" again. Let me think. The user is in the kitchen now, and the refrigerator is there. The previous attempt to open it failed. Maybe the correct command is "open refrigerator" again, but the game might have a different response. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use "open" with the correct object. Wait, the user's last action was "go east", which led them to the kitchen. Now, in the kitchen, the refrigerator is present. The user needs to open it. The correct command would be "open refrigerator". But the game said they can't see it. Maybe the refrigerator is closed, so they need to open it. Let me check the game's response again. The user tried "open refrigerator" and the game said "You can't see any such thing." That's confusing because the kitchen description mentions the refrigerator. Maybe the user needs to look for it again. Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "open" without specifying, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use "open" on the refrigerator. Wait, maybe the user should try "open refrigerator" again. But the game's response was that they can't see it. Maybe the user needs to check if the refrigerator is closed. The original task was to make the refrigerator ajar, so the user needs to open it. The correct command is "open refrigerator". Even though the game said they can't see it, maybe that's a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use a different verb. But the correct action here is to open the refrigerator. So the next step is to try "open refrigerator" again.

Okay, let's see. The user has to follow a series of steps in the TextWorld game. So far, they've opened the antique trunk, retrieved the old key, unlocked and opened the bedroom door, moved east to the kitchen, opened the refrigerator, took the bell pepper, and now they need to place the bell pepper on the stove.

The current location is the kitchen. The previous action was taking the bell pepper from the refrigerator. The next step according to the original instructions is to place the bell pepper on the stove. The user has to make sure they do that. 

Looking at the kitchen description, there's a stove mentioned. So the next action should be to go to the stove and put the bell pepper there. But the user has to use the correct command. The possible commands here would be "put bell pepper on stove" or "place bell pepper on stove". However, in TextWorld, the exact phrasing might matter. 

Wait, the user's last action was "take bell pepper", and now they need to place it. The correct command would likely be "put bell pepper on stove". But I need to check if the game accepts that syntax. Since the user has been using commands like "open refrigerator" and "take bell pepper", it's probable that "put bell pepper on stove" is the correct next step. 

So the next action should be to put the bell pepper on the stove. That's the next step in the sequence. The user has to make sure they do that to proceed. The score is increasing, so each correct action adds a point. Therefore, the correct command here is "put bell pepper on stove".
