Welcome to another profound episode of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First, it would be good if you could ensure that the chest drawer in the bedroom is open. Then, take the old key from the chest drawer. And then, make it so that the wooden door in the bedroom is unlocked with the old key. After that, ensure that the wooden door inside the bedroom is open. Then, go east. That done, ensure that the screen door in the kitchen is open. After pulling open the screen door, travel east. Then, move south. And then, retrieve the milk from the floor of the garden. Then, try to go to the north. Following that, move west. With that done, sit the milk on the stove. That's it!

-= Bedroom =-
You are in a bedroom. A normal kind of place.

You scan the room for a chest drawer, and you find a chest drawer. You can see an antique trunk. You make out a king-size bed. The king-size bed is ordinary. However, the king-size bed, like an empty king-size bed, has nothing on it.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me see. The user is in a text-based game and has already opened the chest drawer in the bedroom, finding an old key. The next step according to the initial instructions was to unlock the wooden door in the bedroom with that key. So the next action should be to unlock the door.

Wait, the game's current state shows the wooden door is closed. The player has the old key, so they need to use it to unlock the door. The command would be something like "unlock wooden door with old key". But in the game's context, maybe the correct syntax is "unlock door" after using the key. Alternatively, the game might require specifying the key. Let me check the previous steps again.

The user was told to "make it so that the wooden door in the bedroom is unlocked with the old key." So the action is to unlock the door using the key. The correct command would be "unlock wooden door with old key". But I need to make sure that's the exact command the game expects. Since the user previously opened the chest drawer and found the key, the next logical step is to use the key to unlock the door. So the next action is to unlock the door with the key.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game, and they've been following a set of instructions. The current situation is in the bedroom. They first opened the chest drawer, found an old key, but then tried to unlock the wooden door with the key. However, the game responded that they need to take the old key first.

So, the next logical step would be to pick up the old key from the chest drawer. The user had already opened the chest drawer, so the key should be inside. The previous action was trying to unlock the door with the key, but since the key wasn't taken, that's why it's not working. Therefore, the correct action now is to take the old key. Once they have the key, they can then proceed to unlock the door. The user needs to make sure they take the key before attempting to use it. So the next command should be "take old key".

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game, and they've been following a set of instructions to open the chest drawer, take the old key, and then unlock the wooden door. So far, they've successfully opened the chest drawer and taken the key. The next step in the original plan was to unlock the wooden door in the bedroom with the old key.

But wait, the user just tried to "unlock wooden door with old key" and got a response saying they need to take the old key first. Oh, right, maybe they didn't have the key in their inventory yet. So the correct sequence is: open the chest drawer, take the key, then unlock the door. Since the user just took the key, the next logical step is to unlock the door. Let me check the previous steps again. The user took the key, so now they should try unlocking the door. The game's response after taking the key was a score increase, so the next action should be unlocking the door. The user's next input should be "unlock wooden door with old key" again, but since they already have the key, that should work. Wait, but the user's last action was taking the key, so the next step is indeed unlocking the door. The assistant's next command should be "unlock wooden door with old key".

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game, and they've been following the steps given in the initial instructions. The current location is the bedroom. The previous actions were opening the chest drawer, taking the old key, unlocking the wooden door, and then the user was asked to open the wooden door in the bedroom.

Wait, the user just unlocked the wooden door, and now the next step according to the original instructions was to ensure that the wooden door inside the bedroom is open. But the user already unlocked it. Maybe the next step is to open it? Or maybe the door is already unlocked but needs to be opened. Let me check the original steps again.

Original steps: After unlocking the wooden door with the key, the next action was to ensure the wooden door inside the bedroom is open. Then go east. So maybe the door is unlocked but not open yet. So the next action should be to open the door. But the user just unlocked it. Wait, maybe "unlock" and "open" are different actions here. So even though the door is unlocked, it might still be closed, so the user needs to open it. So the next command should be "open wooden door".

But the user's last action was "unlock wooden door with old key", which was successful. Now the next step according to the original plan is to ensure the wooden door inside the bedroom is open. So the next action should be to open the door. Therefore, the correct command is "open wooden door".

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps given in the initial instructions. They started by opening the chest drawer, taking the old key, unlocking the wooden door, and then opening it. Now they're in the bedroom, having opened the door. The next step according to the original plan was to go east after opening the door.

Wait, the user just opened the wooden door, so the next logical step would be to move east. The previous action was opening the door, so the next command should be "go east". The user has been carefully following each step, so it makes sense that after opening the door, they need to proceed east as instructed. I should make sure to only output the command "go east" without any extra text.

You've just walked into a kitchen. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You can make out a refrigerator. Hey, want to see a counter? Look over there, a counter. The counter is standard. But the thing is empty. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You scan the room, seeing a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

They opened the screen door, went east again to the backyard. Now, the next step according to the original plan was to move south from the backyard. The user is at the backyard, and the environment says there's an unguarded exit to the south. So the next action should be to go south. The user's score is at 7/9, so they're doing well. They need to continue following the steps meticulously. The original goal was to retrieve the milk from the garden, so moving south from the backyard would lead them to the garden. Therefore, the correct next command is "go south".

They opened the screen door, went east again to the backyard, then south to the garden.

In the garden, they found the milk on the floor. The next step according to the original plan was to "retrieve the milk from the floor of the garden." So the next action should be to pick up the milk. The user's last action was going south, which led them to the garden. Now, they need to pick up the milk. The command should be "take milk" or "pick up milk." Since the game might expect a specific command, "take milk" is more likely. Then, after that, they need to go north, then west, and put the milk on the stove. But the next step right now is to retrieve the milk. So the correct action here is to take the milk from the floor.

They opened the screen door, went east again to the backyard, then south to the garden where they took the milk. Now they're back in the backyard after going north from the garden.

The original goal was to retrieve the milk from the garden and then perform a series of movements. The user has already taken the milk, so the next step according to the initial instructions was to go north, then west, sit the milk on the stove. But wait, the user is now in the backyard again. The next action after taking the milk was supposed to be going north, which they did, leading back to the backyard. 

But the user's last action was "go north" from the garden, which brought them back to the backyard. Now, the next step in the original plan was to move west. The backyard has an open screen door leading west, so the next action should be to go west. That would take them back to the kitchen. Then, according to the instructions, after moving west, they need to sit the milk on the stove. But the stove is in the kitchen. So the correct sequence is to go west from the backyard to the kitchen, then sit the milk on the stove.

But the user's current location is the backyard. The next action should be "go west" to reach the kitchen. Then, once in the kitchen, they can sit the milk on the stove. The user hasn't done that yet. So the next command should be "go west" to move back to the kitchen.

But in the kitchen, the possible exits are east, west, north, or south? The description says "You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You need an unguarded exit?

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps given in the initial instructions. They started in the bedroom, opened the chest drawer, took the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, then went east to the kitchen. They opened the screen door, went east again to the backyard, then south to the garden where they took the milk. Then they went north back to the backyard, west to the kitchen, and then south to the living room.

The original goal was to retrieve the milk from the garden and then perform a series of movements. The user has already done most of the steps: opened the necessary doors, moved through the rooms, took the milk. Now, in the living room, the next step according to the initial instructions was to "sit the milk on the stove." But the user is in the living room now, and the stove is in the kitchen. Wait, maybe there's a mistake here. Let me check the previous steps again.

Wait, after taking the milk in the garden, the user went north to the backyard, then west to the kitchen, then south to the living room. So they are in the living room now. The next step in the original plan was after taking the milk to "try to go to the north," then move west, then sit the milk on the stove. But the user is in the living room. The stove is in the kitchen. So perhaps the correct next step is to go back to the kitchen and put the milk on the stove. But the user is in the living room now. The living room has an exit to the north, but the kitchen is west of the kitchen. Wait, the current location is the living room. The previous step was coming from the south (from the kitchen). So the user needs to go back to the kitchen, then to the stove. But the user is in the living room now. So the next action should be to go north, but the living room's north exit leads to where? The original description said the living room has an exit to the north. But the user is in the living room, so going north would take them to another room. However, the original plan was to go north from the garden, then west, then sit the milk on the stove. Maybe the user is supposed to go back to the kitchen, then to the stove. But in the current state, the user is in the living room. So perhaps the next step is to go back to the kitchen, but how? The living room's exit is north, but that might not be the kitchen. Wait, the user came from the kitchen to the living room. So the kitchen is to the south of the living room. So to get back to the kitchen, the user should go south. But the living room's description says there's an exit to the north, but not sure about the south. Wait, the living room's description says: "There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded." So the user is in the living room, and the exit to the north is unguarded. But the user needs to go back to the kitchen. Wait, maybe the user is supposed to go back to the kitchen via the south, but the living room's description doesn't mention a south exit. Hmm, perhaps there's a mistake in the path. Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go north from the living room, but that might not be the right direction. Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go back to the kitchen by going south, but the living room's description doesn't mention a south exit. Wait, the user came from the kitchen to the living room, so the kitchen is to the south of the living room. Therefore, the user should go south from the living room to return to the kitchen. But the living room's description only mentions an exit to the north. That's confusing. Maybe the user needs to go north, but that's not the right direction. Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go back to the kitchen via the living room's south exit, but the description doesn't mention it. This is a problem. Wait, maybe the user is supposed to go back to the kitchen by going south, even though the description doesn't mention it. Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go north, but that's not the right direction. The original plan was to go north from the garden, then west, then sit the milk on the stove. But the user is in the living room now. So perhaps the next step is to go back to the kitchen, then to the stove. But how? The user is in the living room, and the kitchen is to the south. So the correct action would be to go south from the living room to the kitchen. But the living room's description only mentions an exit to the north. This is a contradiction. Maybe the user is supposed to go north, but that's not the right direction. Alternatively, perhaps the user is supposed to go back to the kitchen via the living room's south exit, even though it's not mentioned. This is a bit confusing. But according to the game's structure, the user needs to sit the milk on the stove. The stove is in the kitchen. So the user needs to go back to the kitchen, then put the milk on the stove. Therefore, the next action should be to go south from the living room to the kitchen. But the living room's description doesn't mention a south exit. Wait, maybe the user is in the living room, and the kitchen is to the south. So the correct action is to go south. Even though the description only mentions an exit to the north, perhaps the user can go south. Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go north, but that's not the right direction. This is a bit of a puzzle. However, given the user's current location in the living room, the next logical step is to go back to the kitchen, which is to the south. Therefore, the correct action is to go south.

You can't go that way.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the steps given in the original instructions. They started in the bedroom, opened the chest drawer, took the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, then went east to the kitchen. They opened the screen door, went east again to the backyard, then south to the garden where they took the milk. Then they went north back to the backyard, west to the kitchen, south to the living room. Now, they tried to go south again from the living room, but it's not possible.

So the next step would be to figure out what's available in the living room. The living room has a couch, a bell pepper on the couch, a low table with a remote, a TV. The exit is to the north. Since they can't go south, maybe they need to check the other directions. But the only exit is north. Wait, maybe they need to interact with something here. The goal was to sit the milk on the stove. But the milk is in their inventory now. Wait, in the garden, they took the milk. Then they went back to the kitchen, then to the living room. The stove is in the kitchen. So maybe they need to go back to the kitchen and put the milk on the stove. But how?

Wait, the user is in the living room now. The previous steps were: after taking the milk, they went north to the backyard, then west to the kitchen, then south to the living room. So from the living room, the exits are north (back to the kitchen) and maybe other directions? The description says there's an exit to the north. So perhaps the user needs to go back north to the kitchen, then go to the stove and put the milk there. But the user is stuck trying to go south, which isn't possible. So the correct next action is to go north back to the kitchen. But the user tried to go south and got a message that they can't. So the next step is to go north again to the kitchen. Then, from the kitchen, they can go to the stove and put the milk on it. That would complete the task. So the next command should be "go north" to return to the kitchen.

-= Kitchen =-
You've just walked into a kitchen. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You can make out a refrigerator. Hey, want to see a counter? Look over there, a counter. The counter is standard. But the thing is empty. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You scan the room, seeing a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in this text-based game. They started in the bedroom, opened the chest drawer, took the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, then went east to the kitchen. They opened the screen door, went east again to the backyard, then south to the garden where they took the milk. Then they went north back to the backyard, west to the kitchen, south to the living room, but couldn't go that way, so they went north again back to the kitchen.

Now, the current location is the kitchen again, with the score at 9/16. The user's next action needs to be determined. The original goal was to retrieve the milk and then perform certain actions, but maybe the game has more steps. However, looking at the previous steps, the user has already taken the milk in the garden. The next steps mentioned in the initial instructions were after taking the milk: try to go to the north, then move west, then sit the milk on the stove. 

But in the current state, the user is in the kitchen. The stove is mentioned in the kitchen description. So maybe the next step is to sit the milk on the stove. However, the user has the milk in their inventory, so they need to go to the stove. But the kitchen has a stove, but in the description, the stove is empty. So the action would be to sit the milk on the stove. But the game might require the user to be at the stove's location. Since the user is in the kitchen, maybe they can do that. So the next command should be "sit milk on stove". But the game might require the exact phrasing. Alternatively, maybe "put milk on stove" or "place milk on stove". However, the user's previous actions were more about moving and interacting with objects. Let me check the previous steps. The user took the milk, then went north, west, south, etc. Now, in the kitchen, the stove is present. So the correct action would be to put the milk on the stove. The game's previous interactions have used commands like "take old key", "unlock wooden door", "open screen door", etc. So the next step is to put the milk on the stove. Therefore, the answer should be "put milk on stove".
