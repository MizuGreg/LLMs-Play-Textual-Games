It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First step, open the chest drawer within the bedroom. And then, take the old key from the chest drawer in the bedroom. If you can get your hands on the old key, insert the old key into the wooden door's lock to unlock it. Then, ensure that the wooden door is open. After that, travel east. Then, open the screen door. Then, go to the east. Then, attempt to travel south. If you can manage that, lift the lettuce from the floor of the garden. And then, head north. Then, try to travel west. Following that, rest the lettuce on the stove. That's it!

-= Bedroom =-
Okay, so you're in a bedroom, cool, but is it standard? You better believe it is.

Hey, want to see a chest drawer? Look over there, a chest drawer. Oh, great. Here's an antique trunk. You see a king-size bed. The king-size bed is typical. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me see. The user is in the bedroom and just opened the chest drawer, which gave them an old key. The next step according to the instructions was to take the old key from the chest drawer. So after opening it, they need to pick it up.

Wait, the previous action was "open chest drawer", and the response was that the chest drawer reveals an old key. So the next logical step is to take the key. The user's score increased by one, so they're on track. The original goal was to get the key, unlock the door, go through, open the screen door, etc. So taking the key is the next necessary step. The user should say "take old key" now. Let me check the environment again. The chest drawer is open, and the key is inside. So the correct command is to take the key. Then, after that, insert it into the door's lock. But the next action should be taking the key. The user's last input was the action, and the system responded with the key being revealed. So the next step is to take it. The user's next command should be "take old key".

Okay, the user has taken the old key from the chest drawer. The next step according to the instructions was to insert the key into the wooden door's lock to unlock it. So now that they have the key, they need to go to the door and unlock it.

Looking at the environment, there's a closed wooden door leading east. The user needs to approach it, use the key to unlock it, then open the door. So the next action should be to go to the wooden door, then unlock it. But the command needs to be in the form of "unlock wooden door" or something similar. Wait, the previous steps mentioned inserting the key into the lock. So maybe the correct command is "unlock wooden door" after having the key. But the user has the key now, so they can proceed to unlock the door. The next step is to unlock the door. So the next action should be "unlock wooden door".

Look at that placard! What does it say? It says Welcome to the kitchen? Well that's cool. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You can see a closed refrigerator close by. You can make out a counter. The counter is typical. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You see a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well Were you looking for a kitchen island? Because look over there, it's a kitchen island. On the kitchen island you can see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the south.
