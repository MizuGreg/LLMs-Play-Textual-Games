I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First off, ensure that the antique trunk within the bedroom is open. After that, recover the old key from the antique trunk. After that, make it so that the wooden door in the bedroom is unlocked with the old key. And then, make absolutely sure that the wooden door inside the bedroom is ajar. After opening the wooden door, go east. Then, doublecheck that the screen door is wide open. And then, attempt to travel east. And then, try to travel south. With that done, lift the milk from the floor of the garden. After stealing the milk, head north. And then, attempt to travel west. With that done, rest the milk on the stove. That's it!

-= Bedroom =-
I am sorry to announce that you are now in the bedroom. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a chest drawer. You scan the room for an antique trunk, and you find an antique trunk. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to a king-size bed. The king-size bed is standard. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. You think about smashing the king-size bed to bits, throwing the bits in the dump, etc, until you get bored.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me see. The user has already opened the antique trunk and found the old key. The next step according to the task was to unlock the wooden door in the bedroom with the old key. So I need to use the key on the door.

Wait, the current room is the bedroom, and there's a closed wooden door leading east. The task says to make the door unlocked with the old key. So the action should be to unlock the door with the key. But how is that done in the game? Usually, you'd use the key to unlock a door. So the command would be something like "unlock wooden door with old key" or "use old key on wooden door".

But the game might expect a specific syntax. Let me check the previous actions. The user first opened the antique trunk, which was the first step. Then the system responded with the old key. Now, the next step is to unlock the door. So the correct command here is to unlock the door using the key. So the next action should be "unlock wooden door with old key". But maybe the game uses "use" instead of "unlock". Alternatively, maybe it's "open wooden door with old key". But since the door is closed, unlocking it would be the right action. Let me make sure. The task says "make it so that the wooden door in the bedroom is unlocked with the old key". So the action is to unlock the door using the key. Therefore, the correct command is "unlock wooden door with old key".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in the TextWorld game. So far, they've opened the antique trunk and found an old key. But then they tried to unlock the wooden door with the key, but the game said they need to take the key first. Wait, maybe they didn't pick up the key yet?

Wait, the previous action was "unlock wooden door with old key", but the game responded that they need to take the old key first. So the mistake here is that the key is in the trunk, and they haven't taken it yet. So the correct step would be to pick up the key first, then use it to unlock the door.

So the next action should be to take the old key from the antique trunk. Let me check the previous steps again. The user opened the trunk and found the key. But maybe they didn't pick it up. So the next command should be "take old key" or "take key from antique trunk". But the game might have specific commands. Since the key is in the trunk, the correct action is to take it. Then, after taking it, they can unlock the door.

So the next step is to take the old key. Then, unlock the door. But the user tried to unlock it before taking the key, which was incorrect. So the correct next action is to take the key first.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game called TextWorld. Their task is to follow a series of steps to achieve the goal. So far, they've opened the antique trunk, found an old key, taken the key, and now they need to unlock the wooden door in the bedroom with that key.

The previous action was taking the old key, and the next logical step would be to unlock the door. The user has to make sure the door is unlocked and then open it. The instruction says to "make it so that the wooden door in the bedroom is unlocked with the old key" and then "make absolutely sure that the wooden door inside the bedroom is ajar." So after unlocking, they need to open the door.

The user's next action should be to unlock the door. The correct command here would be "unlock wooden door with old key." But wait, the system message says to only output the action, like "go north," and nothing else. So the assistant needs to make sure that the next command is exactly what the game expects.

Looking back at the history, after taking the key, the next step is to unlock the door. The user has already taken the key, so the next command should be unlocking the door. The assistant should respond with "unlock wooden door with old key" as the next action.

Okay, let's see. The user has to open the wooden door in the bedroom first. They already opened the antique trunk, found the old key, took it, and unlocked the door. Now the next step was to make sure the door is ajar. But the user just unlocked it, so maybe they need to check if it's open. Wait, the original task said to "make absolutely sure that the wooden door inside the bedroom is ajar." So after unlocking, they need to open it maybe? Or is unlocking sufficient? Hmm.

Wait, the instructions say: after unlocking, make sure it's ajar. So maybe the user needs to open the door. But the door was closed before. So after unlocking, the user should open it. But the game might have specific commands. The previous action was unlocking, so the next step is to open it. But the user's next action was to go east after opening the door. Wait, the original steps were: after unlocking, make sure the door is ajar, then go east. So maybe the user needs to open the door (make it ajar) and then go east. But how to do that? The command might be "open wooden door" or "push wooden door". But the user already unlocked it. Maybe the door is locked but now unlocked, so they can open it. So the next action should be to open the door. But the user's last action was unlocking, so the next step is to open it. Then go east. So the next command should be "open wooden door". But the user might have to check if it's open. Alternatively, maybe the door is now unlocked and can be opened. So the next step is to open it. Then go east. So the next action is "open wooden door".

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps given in the task. So far, they've opened the antique trunk, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door, and opened it. Now they're in the next room, which is probably the garden since the next step mentioned the garden.

The next step in the original task was to go east after opening the wooden door. So after opening the door, the user should go east. But the user's last action was opening the door, so the next command should be "go east". Then they need to check if the screen door is wide open and proceed accordingly. But according to the instructions, after opening the door, they should go east, then check the screen door, then travel east again, then south. Then go to the garden, lift the milk, rest it on the stove. 

But the user's current location is the room beyond the wooden door. The next step is to go east. So the correct command here is "go east".

Of every kitchen you could have sauntered into, you had to walk into an ordinary one. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You can see a closed refrigerator in the room. You can make out a counter. The counter is usual. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. You scan the room, seeing a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. You can see a kitchen island. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? On the kitchen island you can see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps given in the original task. They started in the bedroom, opened the antique trunk, took the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, then went east into the kitchen. Now, in the kitchen, they need to check the screen door.

The next step according to the original instructions was to "doublecheck that the screen door is wide open" and then "attempt to travel east." The user just arrived in the kitchen, so the next action should be to check the screen door. But the current prompt says there's a closed screen door leading east. Wait, the user's last action was "go east," which led them to the kitchen. Now, in the kitchen, the screen door is closed. The task says to double-check that the screen door is wide open. But in the kitchen description, the screen door is closed. So maybe the user needs to open it first?

Wait, the original task said: After opening the wooden door, go east. Then double-check that the screen door is wide open. So perhaps the screen door is closed, and the user needs to open it. But the current state in the kitchen says the screen door is closed. So the next action should be to open the screen door. But the user's next step is to "doublecheck" it's open. If it's not, they need to open it. But the user might have to open it first. However, the user's next action is to attempt to travel east. But if the screen door is closed, they can't go through. So the correct sequence is: check if the screen door is open. If not, open it. Then go east.

But the user's current location is the kitchen. The screen door is closed. So the next action should be to open the screen door. But the user's next command was "go east," which might not be possible if the door is closed. Therefore, the correct next step is to open the screen door. But the user's last action was "go east," which led them to the kitchen. Now, the screen door is closed. So the user needs to open it before going east again. But the original task says to double-check that it's open. So perhaps the user needs to open it first. Therefore, the next action should be "open screen door." But the user's next action is to attempt to travel east. However, if the screen door is closed, they can't. So the correct action is to open the screen door first. But the user might have to do that.

The next step is to pick up the milk. The user's next action should be to take the milk. Let me check the instructions again.

The task says: "lift the milk from the floor of the garden. After stealing the milk, head north. And then, attempt to travel west. With that done, rest the milk on the stove."

So first, lift the milk. The correct command here would be "take milk" or "lift milk". Since the game uses "take" for picking up items, I'll go with "take milk". Then, after taking it, head north. But the user's next action is just the first step, which is lifting the milk. So the answer is "take milk".

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps given in the original task. They started in the bedroom, opened the antique trunk, took the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, then went east to the kitchen. From there, they opened the screen door, went east to the backyard, then south to the garden where they took the milk. Now they're back in the backyard, and the next step according to the original plan was to head north after taking the milk. But the user just went north again, ending up back in the backyard.

Wait, the original task said after taking the milk, they should head north and then attempt to travel west. Then rest the milk on the stove. But in the current state, they're in the backyard again. The milk is already taken, so the next step would be to go west from the backyard. The user's last action was "go north", which brought them back to the backyard. Now, the next action should be to go west. But the user's last input was "go north", and the system responded with the backyard description again. So the user needs to now go west from the backyard. The correct next command would be "go west" to move towards the kitchen or another area where the stove is mentioned. The user needs to rest the milk on the stove, which is in the kitchen. So the next step is to go west from the backyard, then proceed to the kitchen, then rest the milk on the stove. But according to the current prompt, the user is in the backyard, and the next action should be "go west" to move towards the kitchen. The user's previous action was "go north", which didn't change the location, so the next action is "go west".

GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Kitchen =-
Of every kitchen you could have sauntered into, you had to walk into an ordinary one. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You can see a closed refrigerator in the room. You can make out a counter. The counter is usual. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. You scan the room, seeing a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. You can see a kitchen island. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? On the kitchen island you can see a note.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Yes, the user took the milk from the garden and is now in the kitchen. The task says to rest the milk on the stove. So the correct action here is to put the milk on the stove. The command should be "put milk on stove".
