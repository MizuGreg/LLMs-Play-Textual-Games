Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. Your first objective is to open the chest drawer within the bedroom. After that, recover the old key from the chest drawer. Then, unlock the wooden door within the bedroom. And then, assure that the wooden door is ajar. After opening the wooden door, attempt to move east. Then, make sure that the screen door inside the kitchen is ajar. After pulling open the screen door, take a trip east. Following that, make an effort to venture south. With that accomplished, pick up the milk from the floor of the garden. Then, head north. Next, try to go west. With that accomplished, rest the milk on the stove. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Bedroom =-
You arrive in a bedroom. A standard one.

Were you looking for a chest drawer? Because look over there, it's a chest drawer. You can see a closed antique trunk. Look over there! a king-size bed. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me see. The user is in a text-based game where they need to follow a series of steps to win. So far, they've opened the chest drawer in the bedroom and found an old key. The next steps mentioned in the original instructions were to recover the old key from the chest drawer, unlock the wooden door, make sure it's ajar, move east, check the screen door in the kitchen, go east again, venture south, pick up milk in the garden, head north, go west, put the milk on the stove, and then win.

Wait, the user already opened the chest drawer and found the key. So the next step according to the original plan was to unlock the wooden door. But the wooden door is closed, so they need to use the key to unlock it. The user has the key now, so they should try to unlock the door. Then, after unlocking, make sure it's open. Then move east. 

But the user's current location is the bedroom. The wooden door leading east is closed. So the next action should be to unlock the door with the key. The command would be "unlock wooden door". But in the game's context, maybe the correct command is "use key on wooden door" or "unlock door". But the game's previous action was "open chest drawer", so maybe the next step is to use the key on the door. However, the user has to follow the exact steps as given. The original instructions said after opening the chest drawer, recover the key (which they did), then unlock the wooden door. So the next action is to unlock the door. The user has the key, so they can use it to unlock the door. Therefore, the next command should be "unlock wooden door".

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game where they have to follow a series of steps to win. So far, they've opened the chest drawer and found an old key, then tried to unlock the wooden door east of the bedroom. The door is fixed, so they couldn't unlock it. Now, the next step according to the original instructions was to "assure that the wooden door is ajar." But since it's fixed, maybe they need to use the key to unlock it.

Wait, the key might be needed to open the door. The user has the key from the chest drawer. So the next logical step would be to use the key on the door. But the game's current state says the door is fixed. So maybe the user needs to try using the key on the door. The command would be "use key on wooden door" or something similar. But in the game's context, maybe the correct command is "unlock wooden door" again, but since it's fixed, perhaps they need to use the key. Alternatively, maybe the key is for a different lock, but the user has to try.

Looking back at the original steps: after opening the chest drawer and getting the key, the next step was to "unlock the wooden door within the bedroom." But the door is fixed. So maybe the key is needed to unlock it. So the user should try using the key on the door. The correct command here would be "use key on wooden door" or "unlock wooden door" if the key is already in hand. Since the user has the key, they need to use it. So the next action should be to use the key on the door to unlock it.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to complete a series of tasks in a text-based game. So far, they've opened the chest drawer and found an old key. Then they tried to unlock the wooden door, but the system said that wasn't a valid verb. Now, they need to figure out the correct action to take next.

The current location is the bedroom, and the wooden door is fixed. The key is probably needed to unlock it. The previous attempt was "use key on wooden door," which didn't work. Maybe the correct command is "unlock wooden door" instead? But the user already tried that. Wait, maybe the key needs to be used in a different way. Perhaps "open wooden door" or "try to open wooden door"? Or maybe "use key to unlock wooden door"?

Looking back at the game's responses, when the user tried "unlock wooden door," the system said the door was fixed. So maybe the key isn't being used properly. The correct action might be to use the key on the door. But the system didn't accept "use key on wooden door." Maybe the correct syntax is "use key on door" or "unlock door with key"?

Alternatively, maybe the door can be opened with the key by using the correct verb. Since "unlock" was tried before, perhaps "open" is the right verb here. But the door is fixed, so maybe the key is needed to unlock it. Wait, the user has the key, so they need to use it on the door. The system might expect "use key on door" or "unlock door with key." But the previous attempt was "use key on wooden door," which was rejected. Maybe the correct command is "unlock door" without specifying the key? Or maybe "open door" after using the key?

Alternatively, maybe the key is already in the inventory, and the correct action is to "unlock wooden door" again, but the system says it's fixed. Hmm. Maybe the key isn't the right one, but the user has the old key from the chest. Wait, the user has the key, so they need to use it on the door. The system might require the exact command "use key on wooden door," but the system said that's not a recognized verb. Maybe the correct action is "unlock wooden door" again, but the door is fixed. Maybe the key is needed to unlock it, so the correct action is to use the key on the door. But the system didn't accept that. Maybe the correct command is "open wooden door" with the key. Alternatively, maybe the key is already in hand, so the user needs to "unlock door" or "open door."

Wait, the user's next action should be to use the key to unlock the door. The previous attempt was "use key on wooden door," which didn't work. Maybe the correct command is "unlock wooden door" again, but the system says it's fixed. Maybe the key is needed to unlock it, so the user needs to try that again. Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "use key on door." But the system might require "use key on wooden door" even though it's not a valid verb. Maybe the game expects "unlock door with key," but that's not a standard command. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "open door" after using the key. But the door is fixed. This is confusing. The user needs to figure out the correct command based on the game's accepted verbs. Since the previous attempt was "use key on wooden door," which was rejected, maybe the correct action is "unlock door" or "open door." But the system says the door is fixed. Maybe the user needs to try "unlock door" again. Alternatively, maybe the key is already in hand, so the correct action is "unlock door." But the system might not accept that. The user has to try "unlock wooden door" again, even though it's not working. Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "use key on door." But the system might not recognize that. The user needs to proceed with the next action based on the available options.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in a text-based game. So far, they've opened the chest drawer, found an old key, and tried to unlock the wooden door. But the key isn't working, and the door is still closed.

Hmm, the previous attempt was to "unlock wooden door", but the system said that's not a recognized verb. Wait, maybe the correct action is to use the key on the door. But the user tried "use key on wooden door" earlier, which wasn't accepted. Maybe the game expects a different phrasing. Let me check the game's possible commands.

In many text adventures, you have to use the correct verb. Since the key is a tool, maybe the correct command is "use key on door" or "unlock door with key". But the user tried "use key on wooden door" and got an error. Maybe the game expects "unlock door" without specifying the key, but that didn't work. Alternatively, maybe the key is already in the inventory, so the correct action is to "unlock door" again, but the door is fixed. Wait, the door is fixed, so maybe the key is needed. But the user hasn't used it yet.

Wait, the user has the key from the chest drawer. So the next step should be to use the key on the door. But the system didn't accept "use key on wooden door". Maybe the correct command is "use key on door" or "unlock door with key". Alternatively, maybe the game expects "unlock door" and the key is automatically used if it's in the inventory. But the previous attempt to "unlock wooden door" failed because the door is fixed. So perhaps the correct action is to try using the key again, but phrased differently. Maybe "unlock door" is the correct verb, and the key is already in hand. Let me think. The user has the key, so maybe the correct command is "unlock door" again. But the door is fixed, so maybe the key is needed. Alternatively, maybe the game requires "use key on door" but the system didn't accept it. Wait, the user tried "use key on wooden door" and got an error. Maybe the correct command is "use key on door" without specifying "wooden". Let me check the game's possible commands again. The user is in the bedroom, with a wooden door leading east. The key is in the chest drawer. So the correct action is to use the key on the door. But the system didn't accept "use key on wooden door". Maybe the correct command is "use key on door". Let's try that.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to unlock the wooden door in the bedroom using the old key they found. They tried "unlock wooden door" and "use key on door", but the latter wasn't recognized. The game's response says "That's not a verb I recognise." So maybe the correct command is different.

Wait, in text adventures, the commands are usually verbs. The key is in the chest drawer, and the door is locked. The user needs to use the key to unlock the door. The previous attempt was "use key on door", which didn't work. Maybe the correct phrase is "use key on wooden door" or "unlock door with key". But the game might expect a specific syntax.

Looking back at the initial instructions, the user was told to "unlock the wooden door within the bedroom." So maybe the correct command is "unlock door" or "unlock wooden door". But the user tried "unlock wooden door" earlier, and the game said the door was fixed. Then they tried "use key on door", which was invalid. Maybe the correct action is "use key on door" but with the correct wording. Alternatively, maybe "open door" or "push door", but the door is locked.

Wait, the key is old, so maybe the game expects "use key on door" but the system doesn't recognize it. Alternatively, maybe "unlock door with key". But the game's error message says "That's not a verb I recognise." So perhaps the correct command is "unlock door" without specifying the key. But the door is locked, so the key is necessary. Maybe the correct action is "use key on door" but the system is case-sensitive or has different wording. Alternatively, maybe "open door" if the key is used to open it. But the user already tried that.

Alternatively, maybe the game expects "unlock door" as the command, and the key is already in the inventory. So the next step is to try "unlock door" again. Let me check the previous steps. The user had the key after opening the chest drawer. So the correct action is to use the key on the door. The game might require "use key on door" but the system didn't recognize it. Maybe the correct command is "unlock door" without specifying the key. But the door is locked, so the key is needed. Maybe the game is expecting "unlock door" and the key is automatically used. Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "open door" but that's not working. Hmm.

Wait, the user tried "unlock wooden door" and the door was fixed. Then they tried "use key on door", which was invalid. The game's error message says "That's not a verb I recognise." So maybe the correct verb is "use" followed by the key and the door. But the system didn't recognize "use key on door". Maybe the correct command is "use key on door" but with a different phrasing. Alternatively, maybe the game expects "unlock door with key". But the system didn't recognize that. Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "unlock door" and the key is already in hand. So the user should try "unlock door" again. Let me think. The user has the key, so the correct action is to unlock the door with the key.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to unlock the wooden door in the bedroom. They have the old key from the chest drawer. The previous attempts to use the key or unlock the door directly didn't work. The game is prompting for the next action.

The key here is that the user needs to use the key on the door. The error messages suggest that "unlock" might not be the correct verb. Maybe the correct action is to "use" the key on the door. But the user tried "use key on door" and it didn't work. Wait, the game said "What do you want to unlock wooden door with?" which implies that the key is needed. So perhaps the correct command is to "use key on door" or "use key to unlock door". But the system might expect a specific phrasing. Alternatively, maybe the door is locked, and the key is the tool to unlock it. The user has the key, so the next step is to use it on the door. The correct command might be "use key on door" even if it's not recognized, but the game might require a different wording. Alternatively, maybe "open door with key" or "unlock door with key". But the user has to follow the exact command structure. Since the previous attempt to "use key on door" didn't work, maybe the correct action is "use key on wooden door". Let me check the previous interactions. The user tried "use key on door" and got an error. The game says "What do you want to unlock wooden door with?" So perhaps the correct action is to "use key on wooden door". But the user might need to specify the object. Alternatively, maybe the key is already in the inventory, so the command is "unlock door with key". But the system might not recognize that. The correct command here is likely "use key on door" or "use key on wooden door". Since the game is expecting a specific command, the user should try "use key on door" again, even if it's not recognized, but maybe the system is case-sensitive or has a different structure. Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "unlock door with key". But the user has to follow the game's expected syntax. The previous error was "That's not a verb I recognise." when the user tried "use key on door". So perhaps the correct verb is "unlock" with the key as the object. Wait, the game says "What do you want to unlock wooden door with?" which suggests that the user needs to specify the key. So the correct command is "unlock wooden door with key". But the user has to input that. However, the user's previous attempt was "unlock door" which didn't work. So the next step is to use the key on the door. The correct command is "use key on door". But the system might not recognize it. Alternatively, maybe the key is already in hand, so the command is "unlock door". But the game says "What do you want to unlock wooden door with?"

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to unlock the wooden door in the bedroom using the key from the chest drawer. They've already tried "unlock wooden door" and "use key on door", but the game isn't recognizing those actions.

First, I need to figure out what the correct command should be. The key is in the chest drawer, so maybe the player needs to use the key on the door. But the game might require a specific phrasing. Maybe "use key on door" is correct, but the game says "You can't see any such thing." Wait, maybe the key isn't in the player's inventory? But they just opened the chest drawer and took the key, so it should be there.

Alternatively, maybe the command should be "unlock door with key" or "use key to unlock door". But the game's previous responses indicate that "use key on door" isn't working. Maybe the correct verb is "unlock" followed by the object and the key. Like "unlock door with key"? But the game might not accept that.

Wait, the user tried "use key on door" and got "You can't see any such thing." Maybe the key isn't in the right place. Did they pick up the key? The previous step said "You open the chest drawer, revealing an old key." So the key is there, but maybe the player hasn't picked it up yet. So the correct action would be to pick up the key first, then use it on the door. But the user hasn't done that yet.

So the next step should be to pick up the key. The user's last action was trying to use the key on the door without picking it up. So the correct command is "take key" or "pick up key". Then, after picking up the key, use it on the door. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action should be to take the key.

So far, they've opened the chest drawer and taken the key. The next step was to unlock the wooden door, but they kept getting errors because they didn't use the key properly.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to unlock the wooden door in the bedroom using the key they retrieved. Earlier attempts to use the key resulted in errors, like "That's not a verb I recognise" and "You can't see any such thing." But now, after taking the key, they tried "use key on door" again, which still didn't work.

Hmm, maybe the correct command is to "unlock" the door with the key. The game might expect the verb "unlock" instead of "use." Alternatively, maybe the key needs to be used in a specific way, like "open door with key" or "use key to unlock door." But the user has to follow the exact command format the game accepts.

Looking back, the user previously tried "unlock wooden door" which didn't work, then "use key on door" which also didn't. The game's response was "What do you want to unlock wooden door with?" implying that the key is needed. Since the key is now in the player's inventory, the next step should be to use it to unlock the door. The correct command might be "unlock door" if the key is already equipped, or "use key on door" if that's the right syntax. But since "use key on door" didn't work, maybe "unlock door" is the right verb here. Alternatively, the game might require "open door with key." But the user has to try the most likely command based on previous interactions. The user's last action was taking the key, so the next logical step is to use it to unlock the door. The correct command is probably "unlock door" or "use key on door." Since "use key on door" didn't work, maybe "unlock door" is the right command now.

Okay, let's see. The user has been trying to unlock the wooden door in the bedroom. They found the old key in the chest drawer and tried to use it. The previous attempt to "unlock door" didn't work, but when they tried "use key on door", it worked. Now, after successfully unlocking the door, the next step is to make sure the door is ajar. The user needs to check if the door is open. Since the door was just unlocked, it should be open now. The next action would be to move east, as per the original goal. So the next command should be "go east".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in this text-based game. Their goal is to open the chest drawer, get the key, unlock the door, and then proceed through various directions. So far, they've opened the chest drawer, taken the key, and tried to unlock the door. But there was a mistake where they tried to use the key on the door without properly unlocking it first.

The current error message says, "You have to open the wooden door first." Wait, but earlier they tried to unlock the door and succeeded. Let me check the history. Oh, right, after taking the key, they tried to unlock the door, which worked. Then they went east, but the system said they need to open the door first. Wait, maybe the door was locked, and unlocking it is different from opening it? Or maybe the command was wrong.

Wait, the user's last action was "go east" after unlocking the door. But the system said they have to open the door first. Maybe "unlock" and "open" are different actions here. Let me check the previous steps. The user tried "unlock door" and it worked, but maybe the door is still closed and needs to be opened. Or perhaps the system is confused between unlocking and opening. Alternatively, maybe the door was locked, and after unlocking, they need to open it. But the game might have specific verbs. 

The user's next action should be to open the door after unlocking. But the system said they need to open it first. Wait, maybe the door was locked, and they need to unlock it first, then open it. But the user already unlocked it. Hmm. Maybe the system is using different terms. Let me think. The user tried "unlock door" and it worked, but the door is still closed. So maybe the next step is to open the door. But the system is saying they need to open it first. So the correct action would be to open the door. But the user tried "go east" before opening it. So the correct next step is to open the door. But how? The user might need to use the correct verb. Maybe "open wooden door" instead of "go east". But the user is supposed to follow the steps: after unlocking the door, they need to make sure it's ajar. So maybe the next action is to open the door. But the system is saying they have to open it first. So the user should try "open wooden door" next. But in the game's context, maybe "unlock" is the correct verb. Wait, the user already unlocked it. Maybe the door is locked, and they need to open it. But the system is confusing the two actions. So the correct next step is to open the door. Therefore, the user should try "open wooden door" to proceed.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in this text-based game. Their goal is to open the chest drawer, get the key, unlock the door, move east, check the screen door, go east again, venture south, pick up milk, head north, go west, and then put the milk on the stove.

So far, they've opened the chest drawer, taken the key, unlocked the wooden door, and opened it. Now they're in the next room, which is the kitchen, I assume. The next step mentioned was to make sure the screen door is ajar. But the user tried to go east after opening the door, and the game said they had to open the door first. Then they opened the door, and now they're in the kitchen.

The next step in the original plan was to make sure the screen door is ajar. So the next action should be to check or open the screen door. But the user might need to use the correct command. The previous attempts to use "unlock" or "use key on door" didn't work, but after taking the key and unlocking the door, they were able to open it. Now, in the kitchen, the screen door is probably the next target.

The user's last action was "open wooden door", which succeeded. Now they need to check the screen door. The correct command here would be "open screen door" or "push screen door". But since the game might have specific verbs, maybe "open" is the right verb here. Alternatively, if the screen door is already there, maybe "look" or "check" is needed first. But according to the original plan, after opening the door, they need to "make sure that the screen door inside the kitchen is ajar". So the next step is to open the screen door. The user should try "open screen door".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in this text-based game. So far, they've opened the chest drawer, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door, and opened it. Now they're in the next room, probably the kitchen, since they mentioned the screen door.

The current prompt says "You can't see any such thing." when they tried to open the screen door. Wait, maybe the screen door is in a different location. Let me check the original instructions again. The user had to make sure the screen door inside the kitchen is ajar after moving east from the bedroom. But maybe the screen door isn't visible yet. 

Alternatively, maybe the screen door is in the kitchen, which is east of the bedroom. The user just opened the wooden door and moved east, so they should be in the kitchen. But the screen door might not be there yet. Or perhaps they need to look for it. But the game's response says they can't see it, so maybe they need to check another location. 

Wait, the user's last action was "open screen door", but the game says that's not possible. So maybe the correct action is to look for the screen door first. But the user is supposed to "make sure that the screen door inside the kitchen is ajar" after moving east. So perhaps they need to check if the screen door is there. But the game's response says they can't see it. Maybe the screen door is in a different room, or they need to interact with something else first. 

Alternatively, maybe the screen door is in the kitchen, and after moving east, they need to open it. But the game says they can't see it. Maybe the user needs to look around. But the game's input is limited to commands. So perhaps the next step is to look for the screen door. But the user can't use "look" as a command. Wait, in the game, the allowed commands are things like "go north", "open door", "use key on door", etc. 

So maybe the user needs to "open screen door" again, but the game says that's not a verb. Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "open door" if the screen door is considered a door. But the user's original instruction was to "make sure that the screen door inside the kitchen is ajar". So perhaps the correct action is to "open screen door" again, but the game is not recognizing it. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "go east" again to reach the kitchen, but they already did that. Wait, the user's last action was "open screen door", which failed. Then the game says they can't see it. So maybe the screen door is not in the current room. Maybe they need to check another location. But according to the original plan, after opening the wooden door and moving east, they should be in the kitchen. So maybe the screen door is there, but the game's prompt is misleading. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "look" for the screen door, but the game doesn't allow that. So the next possible action is to try "open door" again, assuming the screen door is a door. But the user's instruction was to "make sure that the screen door inside the kitchen is ajar", so perhaps the correct command is "open screen door". But the game says that's not a verb. 

Hmm, maybe the game is expecting "use key on screen door" or something similar. But the user has the key. Wait, the user already used the key to unlock the wooden door. Maybe the screen door is a different type of door. Alternatively, maybe the screen door is already there, and the user needs to "push" or "pull" it. But the game's commands are limited. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "go east" again to reach the kitchen, but they already did that. The user is in the kitchen now. So the next step is to open the screen door. But the game says they can't see it. Maybe the user needs to "look around" but that's not a valid command. 

Alternatively, maybe the screen door is in the kitchen, and the user needs to "open door" again. But the game's prompt says "You can't see any such thing." So maybe the screen door isn't there. But according to the original plan, the user should be in the kitchen after moving east. So perhaps the screen door is there, but the game's prompt is wrong. 

In this case, the user's next action should be to try "open screen door" again, even though the game says it's not a verb. But the user has to follow the instructions. Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "open door" if the screen door is considered a door. 

But according to the game's previous responses, "use key on door" worked when the user had the key. So maybe the correct action here is "use key on screen door". But the user hasn't used the key on the screen door yet. 

Wait, the user has the key, so maybe they need to use it on the screen door. So the next action would be "use key on screen door". But the game might not accept that. 

Alternatively, maybe the screen door is already there, and the user needs to "pull" it. But the game's commands don't include that. 

This is a bit confusing. The user's next action should be to try "open screen door" again, even though the game says it's not a verb. Or maybe "use key on screen door". But the game might not accept that. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "go east" again to reach the kitchen, but they already did that. 

Hmm. The user's original plan was to move east after opening the wooden door, then make sure the screen door is ajar. So maybe the screen door is in the kitchen, and the user needs to open it. But the game says they can't see it. So perhaps the user needs to look for it. But since the game doesn't allow that, maybe the correct action is to try "open screen door" again. 

But the game says that's not a verb. So perhaps the correct command is "open door" in the kitchen. But the user is supposed to open the screen door. 

This is a bit of a puzzle. The user needs to proceed according to the original plan, even if the game's responses are confusing. So the next action should be to "open screen door" again, even though the game says it's not a verb. Alternatively, maybe the user should "look" for the screen door, but that's not a valid command. 

In the end, the user's next action should be "open screen door" as per the original plan, even if the game's response is confusing.

Now they need to make sure the screen door in the kitchen is ajar. But when they tried to open the screen door, the game said they can't see any such thing.

Wait, maybe the screen door is in a different location. The user is in the bedroom now after opening the wooden door.

Alternatively, maybe the screen door is part of the bedroom's east door, but the user tried to open it and it wasn't there.

Alternatively, maybe the screen door is part of the kitchen's east wall, and the user needs to check there. But the user's next action is to open the screen door, which isn't there. So the user needs to find the screen door first. Maybe the correct action is to look around the kitchen for the screen door. But the game doesn't allow that. So the user might need to try another command, like looking around or checking the kitchen's description again.

But according to the game's rules, the user can only output the command. So the next action should be to look for the screen door. But the game's response says they can't see it.

You are in a kitchen. A typical one. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game where they have to follow a series of steps to win. The current scenario is in the Kitchen, and they need to make sure the screen door is ajar, then go east, then south, pick up milk from the garden, head north, go west, and put the milk on the stove.

Looking at the previous steps, the player successfully opened the wooden door in the Bedroom and moved east into the Kitchen. Now, in the Kitchen, there's a closed screen door leading east and an open wooden door west. The user's next goal is to make sure the screen door is ajar. The prompt says to "make sure that the screen door inside the kitchen is ajar. After pulling open the screen door, take a trip east." 

So the immediate action here is to open the screen door. The user tried "open screen door" a few times, but the system kept saying "You can't see any such thing." However, in the current description, the screen door is closed, so the player needs to open it. The correct command should be "open screen door" again, but maybe the system requires a different phrasing. Alternatively, maybe the player needs to "pull open" the screen door. But according to the game's previous responses, the correct command is "open screen door." 

Wait, in the Kitchen description, the screen door is closed, so the player needs to open it. The user's last action was "go east," which led them to the Kitchen. Now, the next step is to open the screen door. The user has tried "open screen door" multiple times, but the system might be expecting a different command. However, based on the game's previous interactions, the correct command is "open screen door." So the next action should be "open screen door" again. But the user might need to check if the screen door is indeed there. However, the game's description says there is a closed screen door leading east. Therefore, the correct action is to open it. The user's next command should be "open screen door."

Okay, let's see. The user is in the kitchen now. The previous action was opening the screen door, which worked. The next step in the original goal was to "make sure that the screen door inside the kitchen is ajar" and then "take a trip east." So after opening the screen door, they need to go east.

Looking at the current location (Kitchen), the available exits are east (screen door), west (wooden door), and north/south. The user just opened the screen door, so the next logical step is to move east. The game's feedback after opening the screen door says the score increased, so the action was correct. The user should now go east from the kitchen. The command would be "go east." Let me check if there are any obstacles. The screen door is open, so moving east should be possible. The user's next action should be "go east" to continue the sequence.

You've entered a backyard.

Look over there! a set of chairs. The set of chairs is typical. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You see a bbq.

Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is an open screen door leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Backyard now. The previous steps involved opening the screen door in the kitchen and going east to the backyard. The current location is the backyard, which has a patio table and a screen door leading west. The user's next goal is to venture south after pulling open the screen door and taking a trip east. Wait, the original instructions said after opening the screen door in the kitchen, they should go east, then try to go south. But now they're in the backyard. The user's next action should be to go south, as per the original plan. The backyard has an unblocked exit to the south, so "go south" is the correct command here. Let me make sure there's no other step needed. The user needs to venture south from the backyard. So the next action is "go south".

The next step is to take the milk. The correct command would be "take milk". Let me make sure that's the right action here.

The next step according to the original instructions was to head north after picking up the milk. So the next action should be "go north". But let me check the current location. The user is in the garden, and the prompt says "You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded." So going north from the garden is possible. 

Wait, the user's last action was taking the milk, and the score is now 9/13. The next step in the original plan was after picking up the milk, go north. Then, after that, try to go west. But the user has to make sure they do each step correctly. So the next command should be "go north".

Okay, let's see. The user has been through several rooms: the bedroom, kitchen, backyard, and garden. Their goal was to follow a series of steps: open the chest drawer, get the key, unlock the door, check the screen door, go east, then south, pick up milk, head north, go west, and finally rest the milk on the stove.

So far, they've done most of these steps. They opened the chest drawer, took the key, unlocked the door, opened the screen door, went east to the backyard, then south to the garden where they picked up the milk. Then they went north back to the backyard, west to the kitchen. Now, the next step according to the original plan was to rest the milk on the stove. 

In the current location, which is the kitchen, there's a stove mentioned. The user has the milk in hand. The next logical action would be to put the milk on the stove. The command should be "put milk on stove" or something similar. But the game might expect a specific verb. Since the user has the milk, they need to place it on the stove. The correct command here is likely "put milk on stove".
