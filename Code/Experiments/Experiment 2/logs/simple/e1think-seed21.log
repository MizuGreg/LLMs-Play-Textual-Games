You are now playing a profound game of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to open the antique trunk in the bedroom. After that, pick up the old key from the antique trunk. After picking up the old key, assure that the wooden door is unlocked. And then, open the wooden door inside the bedroom. And then, attempt to go east. Following that, go to the south. Then, recover the apple from the couch in the living room. After that, try to venture north. After that, put the apple on the stove. Got that? Good!

-= Bedroom =-
Well, here we are in a bedroom.

You see a closed chest drawer. You see a closed antique trunk in the room. You can see a king-size bed. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hopefully, this discovery doesn't ruin your TextWorld experience!

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me see. The user has been through the bedroom and opened the antique trunk, which gave them an old key. The next steps according to the task are to pick up the key, unlock the wooden door, open it, go east, then south, get the apple from the couch in the living room, venture north, and put the apple on the stove.

So after opening the trunk, the immediate next step is to pick up the old key. The user just did that, so now they need to unlock the wooden door. The wooden door is closed, so they need to use the key to unlock it. Once it's unlocked, they can open the door. Then proceed east, then south, etc.

The user's current location is the bedroom, and the wooden door leading east is closed. So the next action should be to unlock the door with the key. The command would be "unlock wooden door" or "use key on wooden door". But in TextWorld, the exact phrasing might matter. Since the key is picked up, the player should try to unlock the door. So the next step is to unlock the door.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text adventure game. Their goal is to open an antique trunk in the bedroom, get the key, unlock the wooden door, open it, go east, then south, get an apple from the couch in the living room, venture north, put the apple on the stove.

So far, they've opened the antique trunk and picked up the old key. Then they tried to unlock the wooden door, but the door is fixed. Wait, the previous action was "unlock wooden door", but the response was that the door is fixed. Hmm. Maybe the key is needed to unlock it. Since they have the key, maybe they need to use it on the door. But the command "unlock" might not be the right one. Maybe they should "use key on door" or "unlock door with key". But in the game's context, the correct command might be "unlock wooden door" but it's not working. Alternatively, maybe the door is locked, and they need to use the key to unlock it. But the game's response says the door is fixed, so perhaps they need to try again. Wait, maybe the key is already in their inventory, so they need to use it. But the previous action was "unlock wooden door", which didn't work. So the next step should be to try using the key on the door. But the game's commands might require a specific syntax. Maybe "use key on door" or "unlock door with key". But the user's previous action was "unlock wooden door", which didn't work. So maybe the correct next step is to "open wooden door" instead of unlock? But the user's task says to "assure that the wooden door is unlocked" and then "open the wooden door". So perhaps the door is locked, and they need to unlock it first. Since they have the key, maybe they need to use the key on the door. But the game's response after "unlock wooden door" was that the door is fixed. Maybe the key is needed to unlock it. So the next action should be to use the key on the door. But how to command that? Maybe "use key on wooden door" or "unlock wooden door with key". But the game might expect a different command. Alternatively, maybe the door is locked, and they need to "unlock" it, but the key is required. Since the user has the key, perhaps the next step is to "unlock wooden door" again, but the game says it's fixed. Wait, maybe the door is already unlocked but the user can't open it. Or maybe the key is needed to unlock it. Since the user has the key, they need to use it. So the next action should be to use the key on the door. But the game's previous response after "unlock wooden door" was that the door is fixed. Maybe the correct command is "use key on wooden door". Let me check the previous steps again. The user first opened the trunk, got the key. Then tried to unlock the door, but it was fixed. So maybe the key is needed to unlock it. So the next step is to use the key on the door. Therefore, the next action should be "use key on wooden door". But the user's previous action was "unlock wooden door", which didn't work. So maybe the correct command is "unlock wooden door" again, but the game says it's fixed. Alternatively, maybe the door is locked, and the key is needed to unlock it. So the user needs to use the key. Therefore, the next action is "use key on wooden door".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to unlock the wooden door using the key they found in the antique trunk. The previous attempt was "use key on wooden door," but the game didn't recognize that as a valid command.

Hmm, maybe the correct verb here is "unlock" instead of "use." Since the key is old, perhaps the action is to "unlock" the door with the key. Let me check the possible commands again. The user has the key, and the door is closed. The correct action might be "unlock wooden door" or "use key on door." But since "use key on wooden door" didn't work, maybe "unlock wooden door" is the right command. Alternatively, maybe "open wooden door" but the door is locked. Wait, the user was told to "assure that the wooden door is unlocked" after picking up the key. So the key is meant to unlock it. So the correct action is probably "unlock wooden door." Let me try that.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to progress through the game by following a series of steps. They started by opening the antique trunk in the bedroom, which they did successfully. Then they picked up the old key. Next, they tried to unlock the wooden door, but the system said that's not a recognized verb. Then they tried "unlock wooden door" again, but it didn't work.

Hmm, maybe the correct action is to use the key on the door. The error message said "That's not a verb I recognise," which might mean that "use key on wooden door" is the correct command. But the user tried "unlock wooden door" again, which didn't work. Wait, maybe the door needs to be unlocked with the key, so the correct action is "use key on wooden door." But the user tried that before and got an error. Or maybe the door is locked, and they need to "unlock" it, but the system doesn't recognize "unlock" as a verb. Maybe the correct verb is "use" instead of "unlock."

Alternatively, maybe the key is already in hand, so the next step is to use it on the door. The user has the key, so they need to use it on the wooden door. The previous attempt was "use key on wooden door," but the system didn't accept it. Wait, the user tried "unlock wooden door" and got an error. Then they tried "use key on wooden door" again, but the system said "That's not a verb I recognise." Wait, maybe the correct command is "unlock wooden door" but with the key in hand. Or maybe the system expects "use key on door" instead of "wooden door."

Wait, the user is in the bedroom, and the wooden door is leading east. The user has the key. So the correct action should be to use the key on the door. But the system might not accept "use key on wooden door" because the verb is "use," but maybe the correct command is "unlock door" if the key is already in hand. Alternatively, maybe the system requires "unlock wooden door" with the key. But the user tried that and got an error. Maybe the system is expecting "use key on door" instead of "wooden door." Or maybe the door is locked, and the user needs to "unlock" it, but the system doesn't recognize "unlock" as a verb. Maybe the correct command is "use key on door."

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "open" the door with the key. But the system might have specific verbs. Since the user has the key, the next step is to use it on the door. The previous attempt was "use key on wooden door," but the system said "That's not a verb I recognise." Wait, maybe the correct verb is "unlock," but the system is expecting "use." Maybe the correct command is "use key on door." Let me check the previous steps again.

The user had the key, so they need to use it on the door. The system might accept "use key on door" instead of "wooden door." Or maybe the door is called "door" instead of "wooden door." The initial description said "closed wooden door leading east." So maybe the correct command is "use key on door." But the user tried "unlock wooden door" and got an error.

Let me check the previous steps again. The user opened the trunk, got the key, then tried to unlock the door. The error was with "use key on door" because the door's name is "wooden door".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to unlock the wooden door in the bedroom using the key from the antique trunk. They've tried "unlock wooden door" and "use key on wooden door", but both resulted in errors.

First, I need to figure out the correct command. The key is in the trunk, so the user has that. The door is closed, so they need to unlock it. The error messages suggest that "use key on" might not be the right syntax. Maybe the correct command is "unlock door" or "use key on door". But the system says "use key on wooden door" is not recognized.

Wait, maybe the door is just called "door" instead of "wooden door". Let me check the previous messages. The initial description said there's a closed wooden door leading east. So the door's name is "wooden door". But perhaps the game expects just "door" as the noun. Alternatively, maybe the correct verb is "unlock" followed by the object.

The user tried "unlock wooden door" which was accepted, but the door was still fixed. Then they tried "use key on wooden door", which the system didn't recognize. Maybe the correct command is "unlock door" without specifying "wooden", or "use key on door". But the system said "use key on wooden door" is not a verb. Wait, the error message says "That's not a verb I recognise." So maybe "use key on" is not the correct structure. Perhaps the correct command is "unlock door" or "open door", but the door is locked. Alternatively, maybe "use key to unlock door".

But the user's previous attempt was "use key on wooden door", which the system didn't recognize. Maybe the correct command is "unlock door" or "use key on door". Let me think. In many text adventures, the syntax is "use [item] on [object]" or "use [item] to [verb]". So maybe "use key to unlock door" or "unlock door with key". But the system might expect "unlock door" if the key is already in inventory.

Wait, the user has the key. So maybe the correct command is "unlock door". Let me check the previous steps. The user opened the trunk, got the key. Then tried to unlock the door. The first attempt was "unlock wooden door", which the system accepted but the door was still fixed. Then the user tried "use key on wooden door", which the system said wasn't recognized. So maybe the correct command is "unlock door" without specifying "wooden", or "use key on door".

Alternatively, maybe the door is called "door" and not "wooden door". Let me check the initial description again. The bedroom has a closed wooden door leading east. So the door's name is "wooden door". But maybe the game allows just "door" as the object. So perhaps the correct command is "unlock door" or "use key on door".

But the system didn't recognize "use key on wooden door". Maybe the correct syntax is "use key on door". Let me try that. The user's next action should be "use key on door". But the system might have a specific command. Alternatively, maybe "unlock door" is the correct command. Since the user tried "unlock wooden door" and it was accepted but didn't work, maybe the correct command is "unlock door".

Alternatively, maybe the key is not the right item. Wait, the user has the key. So the correct action is to use the key on the door. But the system didn't recognize "use key on wooden door". Maybe the correct command is "use key on door". Let me try that.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to unlock the wooden door in the bedroom. They have an old key from the antique trunk. The problem is that the key isn't being recognized as a usable item.

First, I need to check the previous actions. The user opened the antique trunk and got the key. Then they tried to unlock the door, but the system didn't recognize "unlock" as a valid command. Then they tried "use key on wooden door" which was also rejected. The system then asked "What do you want to unlock wooden door with?" implying that the key isn't being used properly.

Wait, maybe the key isn't in the inventory yet. But the user just picked it up from the trunk. Or maybe the correct command is to use the key on the door. But the system says "use key on door" isn't a verb. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the correct command is to "use the key on the door" but the system is expecting a different phrasing. Or perhaps the key is already in hand, and the next step is to try to open the door with it. But the user tried "use key on door" and it didn't work. The system then says "You can't see any such thing," which might mean the key isn't visible or not in the right place.

Wait, maybe the key is in the trunk, and the user hasn't picked it up yet. But the user said they picked it up from the trunk. Or maybe the command should be "pick up key" first, but the user already did that. Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "open door with key" but that's not a valid command either.

The system is probably expecting the user to use the key on the door. The previous attempt was "use key on door," which was rejected. The system then asks "What do you want to unlock wooden door with?" which suggests that the user needs to specify the key as the tool. So maybe the correct command is "use key on door" again, but the system is still not recognizing it. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "unlock door with key." But the system is strict with the commands.

Alternatively, maybe the key is not in the inventory. Wait, the user opened the trunk and got the key. So the key should be in hand. The next step is to use it on the door. The system is probably expecting the command "use key on door" but the system is not accepting it. Maybe the correct command is "unlock door with key," but the system doesn't recognize that.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "open door" and the key is already in hand. But the door is fixed. So the correct action is to use the key to unlock it. The system is probably expecting "use key on door" but the system is rejecting it. Maybe the correct command is "use key on wooden door" again, but the system is not accepting it. The user tried that before.

Hmm, maybe the system is expecting the user to "unlock door" and the key is already in hand. But the user tried that and it didn't work.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to unlock the wooden door in the bedroom using the old key they found. They've tried several commands like "unlock wooden door" and "use key on door", but the game isn't recognizing them. The error messages suggest that the commands might not be in the right format or using the correct verbs.

First, I need to recall the possible correct commands in TextWorld. Usually, actions like "use" or "unlock" are verbs, but sometimes the syntax matters. The key is in the trunk, so maybe the correct command is to use the key on the door. But the game might require specifying the object properly.

Wait, the user tried "use key on door" and got an error. Maybe the door is called "wooden door" instead of just "door". Also, the key is already in the player's inventory, so maybe the command should be "unlock wooden door with key". But the game might not accept "with" in that context.

Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "unlock door" and the key is already in hand, so the game automatically uses it. But previously, when the user tried "unlock door", it asked for the key. So perhaps the key needs to be used explicitly.

Another possibility is that the correct verb is "use" instead of "unlock". So "use key on wooden door". But the user tried that and got an error. Maybe the game expects "unlock" as the main verb, followed by the door and the key. But the system message says "That's not a verb I recognise", so maybe the structure is wrong.

Wait, the user has the key, so maybe the correct command is "unlock wooden door". The game might prompt for the key, but if the key is already in hand, it should work. But in the previous attempt, the user tried "unlock wooden door" and the door was still fixed. Then the user tried "use key on door" which didn't work. Maybe the correct command is "unlock door" without specifying the key, but the game requires the key to be used.

Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "use key on wooden door". The system message said "That's not a verb I recognise" when the user tried "use key on door". So maybe the correct command is "use key on wooden door". But the user tried that and got an error. Hmm.

Wait, the user's last attempt was "use key on door", which the game didn't recognize. The correct command might be "use key on wooden door". Let me check the previous messages. The user tried "use key on door" and got an error. The game might require the exact name "wooden door". So the correct command is "use key on wooden door". But the user tried that and got an error. Maybe the game is expecting "unlock" as the verb. Alternatively, maybe the key is not in the inventory. Wait, the user just opened the trunk and picked up the key, so it should be in hand.

Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "unlock wooden door with key". But the game might not accept "with". Maybe the correct command is "unlock door" and the key is automatically used. But in the previous attempt, the user tried "unlock door" and the game asked for the key. So maybe the key needs to be used explicitly.

I think the correct command is "use key on wooden door". The user tried "use key on door" and got an error, so maybe the door's name is "wooden door". So the correct command is "use key on wooden door". But the system message said that was not recognized. Maybe the game expects "unlock" as the verb. So "unlock wooden door with key". But the game might not accept that. Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "unlock door" and the key is in the inventory, so the game should work. But the user tried that and the door was still fixed. So maybe the key isn't working, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "open" the door instead of "unlock". But the door is locked. So the correct action is to use the key to unlock it. The correct command is probably "use key on wooden door". But the system message said that's not a verb. Wait, maybe the game is expecting "unlock" as the main verb, so "unlock wooden door" without specifying the key. But the user tried that and the door was still fixed. So maybe the key is not in the inventory. But the user just picked it up from the trunk. So that's confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "unlock door" and the key is automatically used. But the game's response said the door is fixed. So maybe the key isn't working. But that's not possible. The user has the key, so the correct command should be "use key on door". But the game says that's not a verb. Maybe the correct command is "unlock door" and the key is in the inventory. But the game is not recognizing it. This is a bit of a puzzle. The user needs to find the right command to unlock the door with the key.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to unlock the wooden door in the bedroom using the old key they found. They've tried several commands like "unlock wooden door" and "use key on door", but the game isn't recognizing them. The error messages suggest that the verbs used aren't valid here.

First, I need to recall the correct commands for TextWorld. Usually, actions like "use" or "unlock" might be part of a larger phrase. Maybe the correct command is "use key on wooden door" but the game expects a different structure. Alternatively, perhaps the key is already in the inventory, so the command should be "unlock door" without specifying the key. But the user has the key, so using it on the door makes sense.

Wait, the game might require the exact phrasing. Let me check previous interactions. The user tried "use key on wooden door" and got an error. Maybe the correct command is "unlock door with key" or "use key to unlock door". But the game's response when the user tried "use key on door" was "You can't see any such thing." So maybe the key isn't in the current context.

Alternatively, maybe the key is in the antique trunk, and the user needs to pick it up first. Wait, the user already picked up the key from the trunk. So the key should be in their inventory. The problem is that the game isn't recognizing the correct verb. Maybe the correct command is "unlock door" without specifying the key, assuming the key is already in hand. But the user tried that and the door was still fixed. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the door is locked, and the key is needed. The user has the key, so the correct action is to use the key on the door. But the game might require the exact command "use key on door" or "use key to unlock door". The previous attempt "use key on door" resulted in "You can't see any such thing." So perhaps the key isn't in the inventory, but the user thought they had it. Wait, the user opened the trunk and found the key, so they should have it. Maybe the game is expecting a different verb, like "open" instead of "unlock". But the door is wooden and needs unlocking.

Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "unlock door with key". But the game might not accept that. The user is stuck here. The next step is to try a different command that the game might recognize. Since the user has tried "unlock wooden door" and "use key on door", maybe the correct command is "unlock door" assuming the key is in hand. But the door is still fixed. Maybe the key isn't the right one, but the user has the old key. Alternatively, the user might need to go to the door and then use the key. But the user is already in the bedroom with the door east. Maybe the correct command is "go east" to reach the door, but the user's next step was to unlock it. Wait, the original task was to unlock the door after picking up the key. So the user is in the bedroom, has the key, and needs to unlock the door. The correct command might be "unlock door" or "use key on door". Since the game is not recognizing "use key on door", maybe the correct command is "unlock door" without the key part. But the door is fixed. Maybe the key is not in the inventory. Wait, the user opened the trunk and found the key. So the key should be in hand. Maybe the game is expecting "use key on door" but the user needs to specify "wooden door". But the user tried that. Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "unlock wooden door with key". But the game might not accept that. The user is stuck here. The next action should be to try "unlock door" again, even though the door is fixed, but maybe the key is needed. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go to the door first. But the user is already in the bedroom with the door east. So the correct command is "unlock door" or "use key on door". The game is not recognizing "use key on door", so maybe "unlock door" is the correct command. Let's try that.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to unlock the wooden door in the bedroom. They have an old key from the antique trunk. The previous attempts to use the key on the door didn't work. The game is prompting for the next action.

First, the user tried "unlock wooden door" but got an error. Then they tried "use key on door" which wasn't recognized. The system is probably expecting a specific command format. Maybe the correct command is to use the key on the door. But the system said "That's not a verb I recognise." So perhaps the correct syntax is "use key on wooden door" or "unlock door with key".

Wait, the user has the key, so they need to use it on the door. The correct command might be "use key on door" or "unlock door with key". But the system might require the exact phrasing. Let me check the previous interactions. The user tried "use key on door" and got an error. Then "use key on wooden door" also gave an error. The system said "That's not a verb I recognise." So maybe the correct command is "unlock door" but with the key. Alternatively, maybe "open door with key".

Alternatively, maybe the system is expecting "use key on wooden door" but the system is not recognizing it. Wait, the user tried "use key on wooden door" and the system said "That's not a verb I recognise." So perhaps the correct command is "unlock door" but using the key. Maybe the system is expecting "unlock door with key". But the user hasn't picked up the key yet? Wait, no, they picked up the key from the trunk. So the key is in their inventory.

Wait, the user's previous action was opening the antique trunk and picking up the key. So the key is now in their possession. So the next step is to use the key on the door. The correct command is probably "use key on door" or "use key on wooden door". But the system is not recognizing it. Maybe the system is expecting "unlock door" but with the key. Alternatively, maybe the command is "unlock door with key".

But the user has tried "unlock door" and the system asked "What do you want to unlock wooden door with?" So maybe the correct command is "unlock door with key". Let me check the previous messages. The user tried "unlock door" and the system responded with that question. So the correct command would be to specify the key. Therefore, the next action should be "unlock door with key".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to unlock the wooden door in the bedroom. They have the old key from the antique trunk. The problem is that the previous attempts to use the key on the door didn't work. The game says that the key isn't visible, so maybe the user hasn't picked up the key yet.

Wait, the user did open the antique trunk and picked up the old key. But maybe they didn't put it in their inventory. The game might require them to take the key first before using it. The last message said, "You need to take the old key first." So the user might have forgotten to take the key from the trunk. But earlier, they had already picked it up. Wait, maybe the key is still in the trunk, and the user hasn't taken it. Let me check the history.

Looking back: The user opened the antique trunk, and the game said, "You open the antique trunk, revealing an old key." Then the user tried to use the key on the door. But the game didn't mention taking the key, maybe because the key was already in the inventory. But the error message says the key isn't visible. Hmm, maybe the key is still in the trunk, and the user needs to pick it up again. Wait, no, the user already picked it up. Maybe the game is expecting the user to use the key after taking it. But the user didn't take it, so the game is prompting them to take it first.

Wait, the user's previous action was trying to use the key on the door, but the game says the key isn't visible. So the user must have not taken the key yet. But earlier, when the trunk was opened, the key was revealed. So maybe the user needs to take the key from the trunk again. So the next action should be to take the old key from the trunk. But in the current room, the trunk is closed. Wait, the user already opened the trunk. So maybe the key is in the trunk, and the user needs to pick it up. But the trunk is open, so the key should be visible. Maybe the user didn't take it. So the correct action is to take the key from the trunk. Then, use the key on the door. So the next step is to take the key.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in the TextWorld game. Their goal is to open the antique trunk, get the key, unlock the door, open it, go east, south, retrieve the apple, put it on the stove, etc.

So far, they've opened the trunk and taken the old key. Now, the next step according to the initial instructions was to "assure that the wooden door is unlocked." But earlier attempts to unlock the door failed because the key wasn't used properly. The system kept prompting for the correct command.

The user tried "unlock door" and "use key on door," but the game didn't recognize those. Then, when they tried "unlock door with key," the game said they needed to take the key first. So the user took the key from the trunk, which was the correct step.

Now, the next logical step is to use the key to unlock the door. The correct command here would be to use the key on the door. But the game might require a specific phrasing. Since the user just took the key, they need to apply it to the door. The previous error was using "unlock door" without specifying the key. So the correct action is to use the key on the door. The command should be "use key on door" or similar. But the game might expect "unlock door with key" or "use key to unlock door." However, based on the previous error, "use key on door" might be the right syntax. Let me check the history.

Earlier, when the user tried "use key on door," the game said it's not a verb. Wait, maybe the correct verb is "unlock." So perhaps the correct command is "unlock door with key." But the game said "What do you want to unlock wooden door with?" when the user tried "unlock door." So the correct way is to specify the key. So the user needs to say "unlock door with key." But the user tried that and got "You need to take the old key first." Wait, that was before taking the key. Now that the key is taken, the next step is to use it on the door. So the correct command is "unlock door with key" or "use key on door." But the game might require "unlock door" after taking the key. Alternatively, maybe "open door with key." But the initial instruction was to "unlock the wooden door." So the correct action is to unlock the door with the key. The previous error was that the user didn't have the key, but now they do. So the next step is to unlock the door with the key. The command should be "unlock door with key." Let me check the previous interaction. When the user tried "unlock door," the game asked "What do you want to unlock wooden door with?" So the correct command is to specify the key. Therefore, the correct action is "unlock door with key." But the user might have to use the key on the door. Alternatively, the game might accept "use key on door." But earlier, "use key on door" was rejected. So maybe the correct command is "unlock door with key." Let me check the previous error messages. When the user tried "use key on door," the game said "That's not a verb I recognise." So maybe the correct verb is "unlock." So the correct command is "unlock door with key." Therefore, the next action should be "unlock door with key."

Now, the next instruction was to go east, then south, recover the apple from the couch in the living room, venture north, and put the apple on the stove.

After unlocking the door, the next logical step would be to open the door. But the user just did that. Now they need to move east. The current location is the bedroom, and after opening the door, they can go east. So the next action should be "go east". Then, after going east, they might enter the living room. But the user needs to go south after that. Wait, the original instructions say after going east, go south. So maybe after going east, they need to go south to reach the living room. Then recover the apple from the couch. Then go north again, put the apple on the stove.

Okay, let's see. The user has been trying to unlock the wooden door in the bedroom. They first opened the antique trunk and found the old key. Then they tried using the key on the door, but the game kept prompting them to use the key on the wooden door. After taking the key, they managed to unlock the door. Now, they've opened the door and moved east.

The next step in the original task was to go east, then south, recover the apple from the couch in the living room, venture north, and put the apple on the stove. So after opening the wooden door and going east, the next action should be to go south as per the instructions. The user has already gone east, so the next command should be "go south" to proceed to the next room, the living room. Then they can look for the apple on the couch. 

But the current prompt after opening the door says "go east" was the last action, but the game said they have to open the door first. So after opening the door, the user can now go east. Then, after going east, they need to go south. So the next action should be "go south" to move into the living room. Then they can recover the apple from the couch.

So far, they've managed to open the antique trunk, take the old key, unlock the wooden door, open it, and then tried to go south. But when they tried to go south, the game said they can't. The current location is the bedroom, and after opening the door, they might have moved into another room, but the prompt says they can't go south from the bedroom. Wait, the initial description of the bedroom mentioned a closed wooden door leading east. So maybe after opening the door, they are now in the room beyond the door, which might be the living room or another area. But the user tried to go south from the bedroom, which is not possible because the door is east. So perhaps the user is still in the bedroom, and the door is east, so going south isn't an option. But the user tried to go south, which is invalid. So the next step should be to check what's available in the current room. Since they are in the bedroom, after opening the door, maybe they can go east into the next room. But the user's next action was to go south, which is blocked. So the correct action would be to go east instead. But the user's previous action was go south, which is invalid. So the assistant should correct that and suggest going east. However, the user's next input was "go south" which is invalid, so the assistant needs to prompt them to try a valid action. But according to the game's feedback, the user can't go south, so the next action should be to go east. But the user's task was to go east after opening the door. Wait, the original plan was: after opening the wooden door in the bedroom, attempt to go east, then go south. But maybe after opening the door, the user is now in a different room, like the living room, and then can go south. But the game's response after opening the door was "You open wooden door." Then the user tried to go south, which is not allowed. So perhaps the user is still in the bedroom, and the door is east. So maybe after opening the door, they can go east into the next room. But the user's next action was go south, which is invalid. So the correct next action would be to go east. But the user's last action was go south, which is invalid. So the assistant should tell them to try going east instead. However, the user's next input was "go south" which is invalid, so the assistant needs to correct that.

Okay, let me try to figure out what to do next. The user is in the Kitchen now. The goal was to recover the apple from the couch in the living room. So far, they've opened the antique trunk, gotten the key, unlocked the door, and went east into the kitchen. Now they need to find the apple.

In the kitchen, the user sees a refrigerator, a counter, a stove, a kitchen island with a note, a screen door east, a wooden door west, and an exit north. The note on the kitchen island might be important, but the main task is to get the apple from the living room. The user hasn't gone north yet, so maybe that's the direction to check. The living room is probably north of the kitchen. The user should go north to the living room, then look for the couch and the apple.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in this text-based game. Their goal is to open the antique trunk, get the key, unlock the door, open the door, go east, then south, retrieve the apple from the living room, venture north, and put the apple on the stove.

So far, they've managed to open the antique trunk, get the old key, unlock the wooden door, open it, and go east into the kitchen. Then they tried going south but couldn't, so they went north into the bathroom. Now, they're in the bathroom, and the next step according to the original plan was to go south from the kitchen, but they went north instead. Wait, the user's last action was "go north" from the kitchen, which led them to the bathroom. Now, they need to figure out the next move.

Looking at the current location: the bathroom has an exit to the south. The user is in the bathroom, so the next logical step would be to go south back to the kitchen. But the original plan after the kitchen was to go south from the kitchen, but the user went north instead. However, the user's current position is the bathroom, so the correct next step would be to go south to return to the kitchen. Then, from the kitchen, they can try going south again, as that was the next step in the original plan. But the user might have gotten confused with the directions. Alternatively, maybe there's another path. But according to the game's current state, the bathroom has a south exit, so going south is the right move here. The user needs to go back to the kitchen and then proceed as per the original plan.

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. An usual one. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You can make out a refrigerator. You see a counter. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the counter. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove! The stove is ordinary. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a kitchen island. You shudder, but continue examining the kitchen island. The kitchen island is normal. On the kitchen island you can make out a note. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this!

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an unguarded exit to the north. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in this text-based game. Their goal is to open the antique trunk, get the key, unlock the door, open the door, go east, then south, retrieve the apple from the living room couch, put it on the stove, and so on.

So far, they've managed to open the antique trunk, take the old key, unlock the wooden door, open it, and go east to the kitchen. Then they went south back to the kitchen. Now, the next step according to the original plan was to go east again, but the user is at the kitchen now. Wait, the user's last action was "go south", which brought them back to the kitchen. The current location is the kitchen, and the next step in the original plan was after going east from the bedroom, then south. But maybe the user needs to proceed from the kitchen.

Looking at the current room (Kitchen), the exits are: closed screen door east, open wooden door west, and unguarded exit north. The user is at the kitchen, and the next step in the original plan was after going east from the bedroom, then go south. But the user is now in the kitchen. The original plan mentioned going east from the bedroom, then south. But after going east from the bedroom, the user was in the kitchen, then tried to go south but couldn't. Then they went north to the bathroom, then south back to kitchen.

Now, the user is in the kitchen again. The next step in the original plan was to recover the apple from the couch in the living room. So the user needs to get to the living room. The kitchen's exits include a closed screen door east. Maybe that leads to the living room? Or perhaps the open wooden door west leads back to the bedroom. But the user needs to go to the living room.

Wait, the original plan said after opening the wooden door in the bedroom and going east (to kitchen), then go south. But in the kitchen, going south is not possible because the kitchen's south exit is not listed. The kitchen has an exit to the north, south is not mentioned. Wait, the description says: "You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south." But when the user tried to go south from the kitchen, they ended up in the bathroom. Wait, no, the user went from kitchen to bathroom by going south, then back to kitchen by going south again. So maybe the kitchen's south exit leads to the bathroom, and the bathroom's south exit leads back to the kitchen? That seems a bit odd, but maybe that's how the game is structured.

But the user's next step is to get to the living room. The living room is mentioned in the original plan as where the apple is on the couch. So the user needs to find a way to the living room. The kitchen's east exit is a closed screen door. Maybe that's the way to the living room. So the next action should be to go east from the kitchen, through the screen door into the living room. Then, in the living room, pick up the apple from the couch.

So the current location is the kitchen. The next step is to go east to the living room. The user hasn't done that yet. So the correct command would be "go east" to move from the kitchen to the living room. Then, once in the living room, pick up the apple. Then proceed as per the original plan.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a sequence of actions in this text-based game. Their goal is to open the antique trunk, get the key, unlock the door, open the door, go east, then south, retrieve the apple from the couch in the living room, venture north, and put the apple on the stove.

So far, they've managed to open the antique trunk, take the old key, unlock the wooden door, open it, and then go east into the kitchen. Now they're in the kitchen, and the next step was to go south, but that's not possible because the kitchen's south exit is blocked. Wait, no—the user just tried to go east again, but the screen door is closed. Wait, the current location is the kitchen. Let me check the previous steps.

After going east from the kitchen, they tried to go east again but the screen door is closed. The user's last action was "go east" which resulted in being told they need to open the screen door first. So the next logical step is to open the screen door. But the user's next action should be to open the screen door. However, the user might not know the correct command. Let me check the possible commands. The screen door is closed, so the correct action would be "open screen door" or "open door east". But in the game's context, the correct command might be "open screen door" since that's what's listed in the description. Alternatively, maybe "open door" if that's the correct verb. But the game's previous responses have used "open" followed by the object. So the user needs to open the screen door first before going east again. Therefore, the next action should be "open screen door".

Okay, let's see. The user's goal is to follow a series of steps to complete the game. So far, they've opened the antique trunk, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door, opened it, and then went east to the kitchen. Then they went south back to the kitchen, tried going east again, opened the screen door. Now, the next step in the original plan was to "recover the apple from the couch in the living room." But the user is currently in the kitchen. So, they need to navigate from the kitchen to the living room.

Looking at the current location, the kitchen has a closed screen door leading east, an open wooden door west, and an unguarded exit to the north. Wait, in the previous step, after opening the screen door, the user is in the kitchen. The next possible move would be to go north, as the exit is unguarded. But the original plan says after going east (from the bedroom), then go south, then recover the apple in the living room. Hmm, maybe the user needs to go north from the kitchen to reach the living room. Alternatively, maybe the living room is connected through another path.

Wait, the user's current location is the kitchen. The kitchen's description mentions an unguarded exit to the north. So going north from the kitchen might lead to the living room. Once in the living room, they can look for the apple on the couch. Then, after retrieving the apple, they need to go north again, put the apple on the stove, etc.

So the next action should be to go north from the kitchen. That makes sense. The user hasn't been to the living room yet, so going north is the logical next step. The answer should be "go north".

Well, here we are in the bathroom.

You can see a closed toilet. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a bath. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a sink. On the sink you can make out a toothbrush.

There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in this text-based game. Their goal is to open the antique trunk, get the key, unlock the door, open the door, go east, then south, retrieve the apple from the living room, and so on.

So far, they've managed to open the antique trunk, take the key, unlock the wooden door, open it, and go east to the kitchen. Then they went south back to the kitchen, tried to go east again but had to open the screen door. Now they're in the bathroom again, and the next step was to go north. But the game is looping between the kitchen and bathroom, which isn't helpful.

The user's current position is the bathroom, and the next action they tried was going north, which led them back to the bathroom. The problem is that the game's environment might not have a direct path from the bathroom to the living room or the apple's location. The apple is supposed to be on the couch in the living room, but the user hasn't reached there yet.

Looking at the previous steps, after the kitchen, the user tried going east (screen door), then north, which brought them back to the bathroom. The key here is to figure out the correct path to the living room. Maybe the screen door in the kitchen leads to the living room, but the user hasn't checked that yet. Alternatively, perhaps the exit to the north from the kitchen is the correct direction.

But in the current state, the user is in the bathroom, and the only exit is south back to the kitchen. So the next logical step would be to go back to the kitchen, open the screen door, and then proceed north from there. However, the user might be stuck in a loop because the game's layout isn't clear. The challenge is to navigate through the rooms correctly, ensuring that each step follows the right path to reach the living room where the apple is located.

The user needs to go from the bathroom back to the kitchen, open the screen door, then go north to the living room. Once there, they can look for the apple on the couch. Then, after retrieving it, they need to put it on the stove. So the next action should be to go south from the bathroom back to the kitchen, then proceed to the screen door and go north to the living room.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in this text-based game. Their goal is to open the antique trunk, get the key, unlock the door, open the door, go east, then south, retrieve the apple from the living room couch, put it on the stove, etc.

So far, they've managed to open the antique trunk in the bedroom, take the old key, unlock the wooden door, open it, go east to the kitchen, then north to the bathroom, and back south to the kitchen again. The current location is the kitchen, and the score is at 5/17. The user is now at the kitchen again, and the next step according to the original plan was to go east after opening the door in the bedroom. But they've been moving around between rooms, so maybe they need to find the living room.

Wait, the original task mentioned going east from the bedroom, then south, then to the living room to get the apple. But in the current state, the user is in the kitchen. The kitchen has a screen door east, which they opened earlier. The kitchen also has a west door leading back to the bedroom, and a north exit. But the living room hasn't been mentioned yet. Maybe the user needs to go north from the kitchen to reach the living room. However, in the previous steps, when they tried going north from the kitchen, they ended up in the bathroom. So perhaps the living room is another direction?

Wait, the kitchen's description says there's an unguarded exit to the north. But when the user tried going north from the kitchen, they ended up in the bathroom. Maybe the living room is in a different direction. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west from the kitchen back to the bedroom, then find another way. But the original plan was to go east from the bedroom, then south. Maybe the user is getting stuck in a loop between kitchen and bathroom.

Alternatively, maybe the living room is accessible from the kitchen via the screen door east. But the screen door was opened, and when they tried going east, they had to open it first. Wait, the user tried going east from the kitchen, but the screen door was already open. However, the previous attempt to go east from the kitchen led them back to the bathroom. That doesn't make sense. Maybe there's a mistake in the room transitions.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west from the kitchen back to the bedroom, then proceed as per the original plan. But the original plan after opening the door in the bedroom was to go east, then south. However, the user is now in the kitchen, so perhaps they need to find the living room from here. But the kitchen's description doesn't mention a living room. Maybe the living room is connected via another door.

Wait, the initial task said after opening the wooden door in the bedroom, the next step was to go east. But when the user went east from the bedroom, they ended up in the kitchen. Then, after some steps, they went north to the bathroom and back. So maybe the living room is connected to the kitchen via the screen door east. But the user hasn't checked that yet. Alternatively, maybe the living room is in the north from the kitchen, but that led to the bathroom. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go back to the bedroom, then go south from there. But the original plan was to go east from the bedroom, then south. Wait, the original steps were:

After opening the wooden door in the bedroom, go east, then south. So after opening the door, the user went east to the kitchen. Then, from the kitchen, they tried going north to the bathroom, then back south to the kitchen. But the original plan was to go south from the bedroom after going east. Wait, maybe there's a confusion here. Let me recheck the original instructions.

Original task: After opening the wooden door in the bedroom, attempt to go east. Following that, go to the south. Then, recover the apple from the couch in the living room.

So after opening the door in the bedroom, the user should go east (to the kitchen), then go south from there. But when the user was in the kitchen, going south would take them back to the bedroom. But the apple is in the living room. So perhaps the living room is connected to the kitchen via another door. But the kitchen's description doesn't mention a living room. Maybe the user needs to find another way.

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go from the kitchen east to the screen door, then perhaps another room. But the screen door leads east, and when opened, maybe that's the living room. But in the previous steps, when the user tried going east from the kitchen, they were told to open the screen door first, which they did. Then, after opening it, they tried going east again, but that might lead to the living room. However, in the previous interaction, after opening the screen door, the user tried going north, which led to the bathroom. So maybe the screen door leads to the living room, but the user hasn't checked that yet.

Wait, the kitchen's description says: "There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an unguarded exit to the north." So when the user opened the screen door, they should be able to go east from the kitchen. But in the previous steps, when they tried going east from the kitchen, they were told to open the screen door first, which they did. Then, after opening it, they tried going east again, but that might be the living room. However, in the previous interaction, after opening the screen door, the user tried going north, which led to the bathroom. So maybe the screen door leads to the living room, but the user hasn't explored that yet.

So the next step would be to go east from the kitchen through the screen door to reach the living room, where the apple is. Therefore, the correct action now is to go east from the kitchen, which is the screen door. Since the screen door was already opened, the user can proceed east. So the next command should be "go east".

Okay, let's see. The user's goal is to recover the apple from the couch in the living room. So far, they've been moving through different rooms: bedroom, kitchen, bathroom, backyard, and now the garden. In the garden, there's a bell pepper, milk, half a bag of chips, and a shovel on the floor. The user hasn't mentioned the living room yet.

The next step would be to figure out how to get back to the living room. The current room is the garden, which has an exit to the north. The user needs to go back through the previous rooms to reach the living room. Since the user is in the garden, going north would take them back to the backyard. From there, they can go west through the screen door to the kitchen, then maybe through the wooden door to the bedroom, but that seems like a loop. Wait, maybe there's another path. Let me check the previous rooms.

In the kitchen, there's an unguarded exit to the north, which led to the bathroom. But the user is in the garden now. So, going north from the garden would take them back to the backyard. Then, from the backyard, they can go west through the screen door to the kitchen again. Then, perhaps through the wooden door to the bedroom? But the bedroom's wooden door was already opened. Alternatively, maybe there's a different route.

Wait, the user's original plan was to go east from the bedroom, then south, then recover the apple in the living room. But the user hasn't reached the living room yet. So, perhaps after the garden, the next step is to go back through the backyard, kitchen, and then find the living room. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the living room is connected to the kitchen. Let me think. In the kitchen, there's an open wooden door leading west, which was the bedroom. But the living room might be connected to the kitchen via another door. However, in the current setup, the user is in the garden, so they need to go back through the backyard, then the kitchen, then maybe the living room. But the user hasn't explored that yet.

Wait, in the kitchen, there's a closed screen door leading east. When the user was in the kitchen, they opened the screen door and went east to the backyard. So, going back west from the backyard would take them back to the kitchen. Then, perhaps from the kitchen, they can go through the open wooden door to the bedroom, but that's where they started. Alternatively, maybe the living room is connected to the kitchen. But the user hasn't found the living room yet.

Alternatively, maybe the living room is accessible from the garden. But in the garden description, there's no mention of a living room. The user needs to find the living room. Maybe the living room is connected to the kitchen via a door. So, the user needs to go back to the kitchen, then find the living room.

But the user is currently in the garden. The next step is to go north to the backyard, then west to the kitchen. From the kitchen, maybe there's a way to get to the living room. However, in the kitchen, the user hasn't found any mention of a living room. So perhaps the living room is connected to the kitchen via a door that's not mentioned yet. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go through the wooden door in the bedroom to the living room. But the user is in the garden, so they need to go back through the kitchen, then the bedroom, then the living room.

But the user's original plan was to go east from the bedroom, then south to the living room. Wait, the user was in the bedroom, went east to the kitchen, then tried to go south but couldn't. Then they went back through the kitchen, bathroom, backyard, garden. Now, they need to find the living room. Maybe the living room is connected to the kitchen. So, from the kitchen, the user can go through the wooden door to the bedroom, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe the living room is connected to the kitchen via another door.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go back through the kitchen's open wooden door to the bedroom, then find the living room. But the bedroom's description didn't mention a living room. The user's original plan was to go east from the bedroom, then south to the living room. But when they tried to go south from the bedroom, they couldn't because the wooden door was closed. But after unlocking it, they opened it and went east to the kitchen. So maybe the living room is connected to the kitchen. The user needs to find the living room from the kitchen.

But in the current scenario, the user is in the garden. The next step is to go north to the backyard, then west to the kitchen. From the kitchen, maybe there's a way to get to the living room. However, in the kitchen's description, there's no mention of a living room. The user might have to explore the kitchen again.

There is an open screen door leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in this text-based game. Their goal is to open an antique trunk in the bedroom, get a key, unlock a door, open it, go east, then south, retrieve an apple from the living room couch, put it on the stove, and so on.

So far, they've managed to open the antique trunk, get the old key, unlock the wooden door, open it, go east to the kitchen, then north to the bathroom, south back to the kitchen, east to the backyard, and then north back to the backyard. Now they're in the backyard again, with the garden and some items like a bell pepper, milk, chips, and a shovel.

The next step in their original plan was to go south from the garden, but the user just went north from the garden to the backyard again. Wait, the current location is the garden, and the exit to the north is the backyard. But the user's next action was "go north" which took them back to the backyard. Now they're at the backyard again, with the same description as before.

The user's task was to recover the apple from the couch in the living room. So far, they haven't found the apple. The garden has some items, but the apple is in the living room. The living room hasn't been explored yet. The user needs to find a way to get to the living room.

Looking at the previous locations: after the backyard, the user went north to the garden, then back to the backyard. The exits from the backyard are a screen door west and an exit south. The garden has an exit to the north (backyard) and the backyard has an exit south. But the living room isn't in the current path. Maybe the living room is connected to the kitchen or another room.

Wait, in the kitchen, there's an open wooden door leading west, which might be the bedroom, but the user already went through that. The kitchen also has a screen door east leading to the backyard. The living room might be connected via another door. But in the current locations, the user hasn't encountered the living room yet.

So the user needs to find the living room. Maybe from the kitchen, there's a way to go to the living room. But in the kitchen description, the exits are east (screen door), west (open wooden door), and north (unguarded exit). The user has been going back and forth between kitchen, bathroom, backyard, garden.

Alternatively, maybe the living room is connected to the backyard via the patio table or something else. But in the garden, there's a patio table, but no mention of a living room. The user needs to find the living room couch where the apple is.

Perhaps the user needs to go back to the kitchen, then find another exit. Wait, in the kitchen, there's an unguarded exit to the north. But when the user was in the kitchen, they tried going north and ended up in the bathroom. Maybe the living room is connected to another part of the house.

Alternatively, maybe the living room is connected to the garden via the patio table. But the user hasn't found any clues about that. The current task is to recover the apple from the living room couch. Since the user hasn't found the living room yet, they need to explore other paths.

Looking at the current location, the backyard has an exit to the south. If the user goes south from the backyard, they might reach the garden again, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe the living room is connected to the kitchen via a different door. The user needs to check all possible exits.

In the kitchen, the exits are east (screen door to backyard), west (open wooden door to bedroom), and north (unguarded exit to bathroom). The user has already explored those. Maybe the living room is connected to the kitchen via another door, but it's not listed. Alternatively, maybe the living room is connected to the garden through some other means.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go back to the bedroom, then find another way. But the bedroom's description doesn't mention a living room. The user's original plan was to go east from the bedroom, then south, but that led to the kitchen.

This is getting a bit confusing. The user needs to find the living room couch. Since the user is in the backyard, maybe they need to go west through the screen door to the kitchen again, then find another way. But the kitchen's exits are already explored.

Alternatively, maybe the living room is connected to the garden via the patio table. But the user hasn't found any clues about that. The user needs to check all possible paths again.

Given the current location in the backyard, the user might need to go west through the screen door to the kitchen, then explore further. But the user has already been there. Maybe the living room is connected to the kitchen via a different exit. The user needs to check all possible exits again.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go back to the kitchen, then north again, but that leads to the bathroom. Hmm.

Wait, in the kitchen, there's an unguarded exit to the north. The user tried going north from the kitchen and ended up in the bathroom. Maybe the living room is connected to the kitchen via another door. But the user hasn't found it yet.

Alternatively, maybe the living room is connected to the garden. The garden has a bell pepper, milk, chips, and a shovel. Maybe the apple is in the garden, but the user's plan says it's on the couch in the living room. So that's not the case.

The user needs to find the living room. Since the user is in the backyard, maybe they need to go back to the kitchen, then check other exits. But the user has already been there. Maybe the living room is connected to the backyard via the patio table. But the user hasn't found any clues.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go back to the bedroom, then east again. But the bedroom's east door is locked. The user has already unlocked it.

This is tricky. The user needs to find the living room. Since the user hasn't found it yet, maybe they need to explore the kitchen again for any possible exits. Or maybe the living room is connected to the garden through the patio table. But the user hasn't found any clues.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go back to the kitchen, then north again, but that leads to the bathroom. The user needs to find another way.

Given the current situation, the user is in the backyard, and the next step is to go south, but that leads back to the garden. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west through the screen door to the kitchen again, then check other exits.

But the user's last action was "go north" from the garden, which took them back to the backyard. Now they're in the backyard again. The next possible action is to go west through the screen door to the kitchen. Then, from the kitchen, maybe explore other exits.

So the next command should be "go west" from the backyard to the kitchen. But the user is in the backyard, so the correct command would be "go west" to return to the kitchen. Then, from the kitchen, check if there's a way to the living room.

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. An usual one. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You can make out a refrigerator. You see a counter. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the counter. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove! The stove is ordinary. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a kitchen island. You shudder, but continue examining the kitchen island. The kitchen island is normal. On the kitchen island you can make out a note. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this!

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an unguarded exit to the north. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in this text-based game. Their goal is to open an antique trunk in the bedroom, get a key, unlock a door, open it, go east, then south, retrieve an apple from the living room couch, and so on.

Looking at the current state, the user has been moving around different rooms: bedroom, kitchen, bathroom, backyard, garden, and back to the kitchen. The score is at 5/21, which suggests they've completed some steps but maybe not all. 

The latest action was "go west" from the backyard, which brought them back to the kitchen. Now, the user needs to proceed with the next steps. The original plan was after getting the key and opening the door, they needed to go east, then south, find the apple in the living room, etc. But in the current path, they've looped between kitchen and backyard. 

Wait, the user hasn't mentioned the living room yet. The task included recovering the apple from the couch in the living room. So maybe the next step is to find the living room. But in the current rooms, the user is in the kitchen. The kitchen has an exit to the north (which led to the garden), west (back to backyard), and east (screen door). But the living room isn't listed here. 

Perhaps the user needs to check the kitchen's description again. The kitchen's description mentions a kitchen island with a note, but no living room. The backyard has a patio table and chairs, but not the living room. The garden has some items, but again, not the living room. 

Wait, maybe the living room is connected through another door. The user might have missed a door. Let me check the previous rooms. In the bedroom, there's a closed wooden door east, which they opened. Then they went east to the kitchen. The kitchen's east door is a screen door. Maybe the living room is connected via another path. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go back to the bedroom and check other exits. 

But the user's current location is the kitchen. The kitchen has an unguarded exit to the north (garden), west (backyard), and east (screen door). The screen door was opened earlier. Maybe the living room is connected via the screen door in the kitchen? Or perhaps the user needs to go back to the bedroom and check other exits. 

Alternatively, maybe the living room is in the garden or backyard. But the garden has a bell pepper, milk, etc., but no couch. The backyard has chairs and a patio table. The living room couch wasn't mentioned in the garden or backyard. 

Wait, the original task said to "recover the apple from the couch in the living room." So the user needs to find the living room. But in the current game state, the user hasn't entered the living room yet. The path so far has been bedroom -> kitchen -> backyard -> garden -> kitchen -> backyard -> kitchen. 

Maybe the user needs to check the kitchen's description again for any possible exits. The kitchen has an open screen door east, open wooden door west, and unguarded exit north. No mention of a living room. So perhaps the living room is connected via another route. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go back to the bedroom and check the closed chest drawer or the antique trunk again. But the trunk was already opened, and the key was taken. 

Wait, the user's score is 5/21. The original steps required opening the trunk (1), pick up key (2), unlock door (3), open door (4), go east (5), go south (6), get apple (7), go north (8), put apple on stove (9). So far, the user has done steps 1-4 (open trunk, get key, unlock door, open door), then went east to kitchen, then south to garden, then back. But the next step after opening the door was to go east, then south. But the user is in the kitchen now. 

Maybe the user needs to go back to the bedroom, open the door, then go east to the kitchen, then south to the garden, but that's not leading to the living room. 

Alternatively, perhaps the living room is connected via the kitchen's screen door. But the screen door was opened earlier, leading to the backyard. 

This is confusing. The user might have missed a step where the living room is accessible. Alternatively, maybe the living room is in the garden, but the garden's description doesn't mention a couch. 

Wait, the garden has a bell pepper, milk, half a bag of chips, and a shovel. No couch. The backyard has chairs and a patio table. The kitchen has a note. The bathroom has a toothbrush. The bedroom is empty. 

Maybe the living room is connected via the kitchen's north exit (garden), but the garden doesn't have a couch. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check the kitchen island for the note mentioned. The note might have clues. But the note is just "It doesn't get more TextWorld than this!" which is probably a red herring. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go back to the bedroom, check the closed chest drawer again. But the chest was already opened. 

Wait, the user's current location is the kitchen. The next step according to the original plan was after opening the door in the bedroom, go east to the kitchen, then go south. But the user is in the kitchen now. So maybe the next step is to go south from the kitchen to the garden, then find the apple. But the garden doesn't have the apple. 

This suggests that the user might have missed a step where the living room is accessible. Maybe the user needs to go back to the bedroom, check the closed wooden door again, but it's already open. 

Alternatively, maybe the living room is connected via the kitchen's west door (backyard), but the backyard doesn't have the couch. 

This is a bit of a dead end. The user might need to check if there's another path. But based on the current game state, the user is in the kitchen, and the next logical step would be to go south to the garden, but that doesn't help. 

Wait, the user's original plan was after opening the wooden door in the bedroom, go east (to kitchen), then go south. But the user is in the kitchen now. So maybe the next step is to go south from the kitchen to the garden, but the garden doesn't have the apple. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go back to the bedroom, then go east again to the kitchen, then south to the garden. But that's not leading to the living room. 

This suggests that the user might have made a mistake in the path, and the living room is not in the current rooms. Maybe the living room is connected via another door that hasn't been explored yet. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check the kitchen's description again for any possible exits. The kitchen has an open screen door east, open wooden door west, and unguarded exit north. No mention of a living room. 

Hmm. The user's next action should be to go south from the kitchen to the garden, but that doesn't help. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go back to the bedroom and check the closed chest drawer again. But the trunk was already opened. 

Wait, the user's score is 5/21. The original steps required 9 steps. The user has completed 4 steps (open trunk, get key, unlock door, open door), then went east to kitchen, then south to garden, then back. So maybe the user is stuck and needs to find another way. 

Alternatively, maybe the living room is in the garden, but the garden's description doesn't mention a couch. The user might need to look for the apple in the garden, but it's not there. 

This is confusing. The user might need to check if there's a different path. But based on the current game state, the next logical step is to go south from the kitchen to the garden, but that doesn't help. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go back to the bedroom and check the closed wooden door again, but it's already open. 

I think the user might have a mistake in the path, and the living room is not accessible yet. The next step should be to go back to the bedroom, then check the closed chest drawer again, but that's already done. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go back to the kitchen's screen door and go east to the backyard again. 

But the user's goal is to recover the apple from the living room couch. Since the current rooms don't have the living room, maybe the user needs to find another way. 

Wait, maybe the user needs to go back to the bedroom, then go east again to the kitchen, then south to the garden, then north back to the kitchen, then west to the backyard, then north to the garden again. This seems like a loop. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check the kitchen's note again. The note says "It doesn't get more TextWorld than this!" which might be a clue, but I don't see how. 

At this point, the user is stuck. The next step should be to go south from the kitchen to the garden, but that doesn't help. So the user might need to try a different approach. 

But according to the game's current state, the user is in the kitchen. The next action should be to go south to the garden, but that doesn't help. So the user might need to try another command, like looking around for the apple. 

But the user's task is to recover the apple from the couch in the living room. Since the living room isn't in the current rooms, maybe the user needs to find another way. 

Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the earlier steps. For example, after opening the wooden door in the bedroom, they went east to the kitchen, but maybe they should have gone south instead. 

But the original plan was after opening the door, go east, then south. So the user is following that. 

This is a bit of a puzzle. The user might need to check if the living room is connected via another door. But based on the game's descriptions, it's not clear. 

In conclusion, the next step should be to go south from the kitchen to the garden, but that doesn't help. So the user might need to try a different approach. However, based on the current game state, the user is in the kitchen, and the next action is to go south. But since that doesn't lead to the living room, maybe the user needs to check if there's another way. 

But the user's instructions say to only output the command. So the next action would be to go south.

-= Living Room =-
You are in a living room. An ordinary kind of place.

You can see a couch. The couch is standard. On the couch you can see an apple. You smell a great smell, and follow it to a low table. On the low table you see a remote. You can make out a tv. The tv is typical. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north.

Okay, let's see. The user's goal is to recover the apple from the couch in the living room and then put it on the stove. So far, they've managed to open the antique trunk, get the old key, unlock the wooden door, open it, and navigate through the kitchen and backyard to get to the living room. Now, in the living room, the apple is on the couch. The next step is to pick up the apple.

But wait, the user's last action was going south, which led them to the living room. The current description mentions the apple is on the couch. So the next logical step is to pick up the apple. However, the user's previous actions have been moving between rooms, so they need to interact with the couch. The command should be "take apple from couch" or something similar. But in TextWorld, the exact phrasing might matter. The user has to use the correct verb. Since the apple is on the couch, the correct action would be to take it. So the next command should be "take apple from couch". Then, after picking it up, they need to go to the stove, which is in the kitchen. But first, they need to go back to the kitchen. However, the current location is the living room. So after taking the apple, they need to go north to the kitchen. But the user's next action should be to take the apple first. Let me check the previous steps again. The user was told to "recover the apple from the couch in the living room. After that, try to venture north. After that, put the apple on the stove." So the sequence is: take apple from couch, then go north (to kitchen), then put apple on stove. So the immediate next action is to take the apple. Therefore, the correct command is "take apple from couch".

Now, the next step according to the original plan is to "put the apple on the stove." But the user is in the Living Room. The stove was mentioned in the Kitchen. So they need to go from the Living Room to the Kitchen, then place the apple on the stove.

Looking at the current location: the Living Room has an exit to the north, which probably leads back to the Kitchen. The user needs to go north to the Kitchen. Once there, they can put the apple on the stove. Let me check the previous steps to make sure they're on the right path.

Yes, the last action was taking the apple from the couch. Now, the next command should be to go north to the Kitchen. Then, in the Kitchen, they can put the apple on the stove. So the correct next action is "go north".

Okay, let's see. The user has been navigating through different rooms in the TextWorld game. Their goal is to open the antique trunk, get the key, unlock the door, open the door, go east, then south, retrieve the apple from the couch, and put it on the stove.

So far, they've successfully opened the antique trunk, taken the key, unlocked the wooden door, opened it, and went east to the kitchen. Then they went south to the bathroom, back to the kitchen, then to the backyard, garden, and finally to the living room where they took the apple from the couch. Now they need to put the apple on the stove.

Wait, the stove is in the kitchen. The user is currently in the kitchen again after going north from the living room. The stove is mentioned in the kitchen description. So the next step is to go to the stove and put the apple there. But how? The user has the apple in their inventory now, right? They took it from the couch in the living room.

So the correct action here would be to go to the stove, then put the apple on it. But the current location is the kitchen. The stove is in the kitchen. So the user needs to go to the stove. But the game might require them to first move to the stove's location. However, in the kitchen description, the stove is mentioned as "ordinary" and "there isn't a thing on it." So maybe the user can just put the apple on the stove directly.

But the command structure in TextWorld usually requires moving to the object first. However, sometimes you can interact with objects without moving if they are in the same room. Since the user is in the kitchen and the stove is here, they can try putting the apple on the stove. The correct command would be "put apple on stove" or "put apple on stove." Let me check the previous steps. The user has the apple, so they need to put it on the stove. The stove is in the kitchen, so the action is possible here.

Therefore, the next command should be "put apple on stove."
