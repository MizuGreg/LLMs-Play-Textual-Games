I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! First off, assure that the antique trunk within the bedroom is open. And then, take the old key from the antique trunk inside the bedroom. Once you have got the old key, doublecheck that the wooden door is unlocked. And then, open the wooden door. Once you have pulled open the wooden door, attempt to venture east. That done, make sure that the refrigerator is open. Then, recover the lettuce from the refrigerator in the kitchen. If you can get your hands on the lettuce, place the lettuce on the stove in the kitchen. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Bedroom =-
You've just walked into a bedroom.

You can see a chest drawer. You can see a closed antique trunk. What's that over there? It looks like it's a king-size bed. The king-size bed is ordinary. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me see. The user is in a text-based game called TextWorld. Their goal is to follow a series of steps to win. So far, they've opened the antique trunk in the bedroom and found an old key. The next step according to the instructions was to take the old key from the trunk. Then check if the wooden door is unlocked, and if so, open it. After that, go east, open the refrigerator, get the lettuce, put it on the stove, and win.

Wait, the user just opened the trunk and got the key. The next action should be to take the key. But the system message says to only output the action, like "go north". So the next step is to take the key. Let me check the current room description again. In the bedroom, after opening the trunk, the key is inside. So the next command should be "take old key". But maybe the game uses different verbs. Wait, in TextWorld, the correct command would be "take old key" or "get old key". But the user's previous action was "open antique trunk", which worked. So probably, the next step is to take the key. Then check the door. But the user's next input should be the command to take the key. So the answer is "take old key".

Okay, let's see. The user has already opened the antique trunk and taken the old key. The next step according to the original instructions was to double-check that the wooden door is unlocked. So now, I need to make sure the door is unlocked. Since the user has the old key, maybe using it to unlock the door makes sense. The command should be "unlock wooden door" or "use old key on wooden door". But the game might expect a specific command. Let me check the previous actions. The user was told to "doublecheck that the wooden door is unlocked" after getting the key. So the next action should be to unlock the door with the key. The correct command here is likely "unlock wooden door" or "use old key on wooden door". Since the key is in hand, "unlock wooden door" might be the right command. Let me confirm the previous steps. The user took the key, so now they need to unlock the door. The next action should be "unlock wooden door".

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps to open the antique trunk, take the key, unlock the door, and open it. Now they've moved east, as per the instructions. The next step mentioned was to check if the refrigerator is open. So the next action should be to go east to enter the kitchen, then check the refrigerator.

Wait, the user just opened the wooden door and moved east. The next step is to make sure the refrigerator is open. So the command should be to open the refrigerator. But the user needs to be in the kitchen where the refrigerator is. Since they just opened the door and moved east, they're probably in the kitchen now. So the next action is to open the refrigerator. Then take the lettuce, put it on the stove, and win. So the next command is "open refrigerator".

Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text adventure game, and they've followed a set of instructions to get the old key, unlock the door, and open the wooden door. Now they're in the next room, but the problem is that they tried to open the refrigerator, which isn't visible.

First, I need to check the current location. After opening the wooden door and moving east, the user should be in the kitchen. The original goal was to get the lettuce from the refrigerator in the kitchen. But the user tried to open the refrigerator from the bedroom, which doesn't make sense. Maybe the refrigerator is in the kitchen, so they need to move there first.

Wait, the user just opened the wooden door, which leads east. The next step would be to move into the kitchen. The error message says "You can't see any such thing" when trying to open the refrigerator, which implies that the refrigerator isn't in the current room. So the user hasn't moved to the kitchen yet. The correct action would be to go east to the kitchen, then open the refrigerator.

But the user's last action was "open refrigerator" from the bedroom, which is incorrect. So the next step is to move east to the kitchen. Then, once in the kitchen, they can open the refrigerator. The user needs to check the available commands in the kitchen to find the refrigerator and proceed.

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. A typical one. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

You see a refrigerator. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. The counter is usual. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Kitchen now. The goal is to get the lettuce from the refrigerator, put it on the stove, and win. So far, they've opened the wooden door from the bedroom to get to the kitchen. Now, in the kitchen, there's a refrigerator, a stove, a kitchen island with a note, and exits in four directions.

The next step after entering the kitchen was to open the refrigerator. But the user tried "open refrigerator" and got a message saying they can't see it. Wait, maybe the refrigerator is closed, so they need to open it first. But the user just tried to open it, but the game said they can't. Wait, maybe the refrigerator is already open? Let me check the description again.

Looking at the kitchen description: "You see a refrigerator. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. The counter is usual. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island."

So the refrigerator is just mentioned as being there. The user needs to open it. But when they tried "open refrigerator", the game said they can't see any such thing. Wait, maybe the refrigerator is closed, so they need to open it. But the game's response was "You can't see any such thing." That's confusing. Maybe the user needs to check if the refrigerator is closed. Wait, the user's previous action was "open refrigerator", but the game didn't recognize it. Maybe the correct command is "open the refrigerator" with "the" or maybe the game expects a different verb. Alternatively, maybe the refrigerator is already open, but the user needs to check inside.

Wait, the original plan was: after opening the wooden door, venture east (which they did, leading to the kitchen), then make sure the refrigerator is open. So maybe the refrigerator is closed, and the user needs to open it. But the game's response when they tried "open refrigerator" was "You can't see any such thing." That suggests that maybe the user is supposed to look for the refrigerator again. Wait, but the user is in the kitchen, and the description says "You see a refrigerator." So why can't they open it? Maybe the game expects the user to use "open" with the object, but the game's parser is strict. Alternatively, maybe the refrigerator is already open, and the user needs to take the lettuce from inside.

Wait, the user's next action after entering the kitchen was to open the refrigerator. But the game said they can't see it. Maybe the user made a mistake in the command. Let me check the previous steps again. The user was in the bedroom, opened the trunk, took the key, unlocked and opened the door, then went east to the kitchen. Now, in the kitchen, the user's next action was "open refrigerator", but the game said they can't see it. Maybe the user needs to check if the refrigerator is closed. Wait, the description says "You see a refrigerator." So it's there. Maybe the correct command is "open refrigerator" but the game doesn't recognize it. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use "open" with the object, but the game expects "the refrigerator".

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to look for the refrigerator again. But the user already saw it. Maybe the game is expecting the user to check if the refrigerator is open. Wait, the user's next step was to "open refrigerator", but the game said they can't see it. That's conflicting. Maybe the user needs to check if the refrigerator is closed. Wait, the user's goal is to open the refrigerator, take the lettuce, then put it on the stove. So maybe the user needs to first open the refrigerator. But the game's response says they can't see it. That's confusing. Maybe the user needs to check the kitchen again. Alternatively, maybe the user should look for the lettuce in the refrigerator. But the user hasn't opened it yet.

Wait, the user's previous action was "open refrigerator", but the game said they can't see it. Maybe the user made a mistake in the command. Maybe the correct command is "open the refrigerator". Let me check the game's response again. The user wrote "open refrigerator", and the game said "You can't see any such thing." So maybe the game expects "the" before the object. So the correct command would be "open the refrigerator". But the user didn't include "the". So maybe that's the error. Therefore, the next action should be "open the refrigerator".

But the user is supposed to only output the command, nothing else. So the correct next action is "open the refrigerator". However, the user's previous attempt was "open refrigerator", which didn't work. So the user needs to try again with "the". But the user's next action is to "open the refrigerator".

But the user is in the kitchen, and the game says "You see a refrigerator." So the user should be able to open it. Maybe the game is expecting the user to use "open" with the object. So the correct command is "open refrigerator". But the game said they can't see it. That's confusing. Maybe the user needs to check the kitchen again. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to look for the refrigerator again. But the user already saw it. Maybe the user needs to check if the refrigerator is closed. The user's next action should be to open it. So the correct command is "open refrigerator".

But the game's response was "You can't see any such thing." So maybe the user is supposed to look for the refrigerator again. But the user is already in the kitchen and sees it. This is a bit of a puzzle. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check the kitchen island or the note. But the user's goal is to get the lettuce from the refrigerator. So the user needs to open the refrigerator. Therefore, the next action is "open refrigerator".

Okay, the user needs to take the lettuce from the refrigerator. They just opened the refrigerator and found a bell pepper and lettuce. The next step is to pick up the lettuce. So the command should be "take lettuce". Let me make sure that's the correct action here. Yes, since the refrigerator is open, taking the lettuce is the next logical step. Then, after taking the lettuce, they need to put it on the stove. But first, the lettuce has to be taken. So the next action is definitely "take lettuce".

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps to solve the game. They started in the bedroom, opened the trunk, took the key, unlocked and opened the door, then went east to the kitchen. Now they've opened the refrigerator, taken the lettuce, and the next step is to put it on the stove.

The current location is the kitchen, and the last action was taking the lettuce. The next logical step would be to place the lettuce on the stove. The user needs to check if the stove is accessible and if there's a command to put the item there. Since the stove is mentioned as being in the kitchen, the correct action should be to put the lettuce on the stove. The user's previous actions have been about interacting with objects, so "put lettuce on stove" makes sense. I need to make sure that's the exact command expected here.
