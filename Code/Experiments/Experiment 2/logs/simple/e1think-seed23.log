You are now playing a profound session of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First of all, ensure that the antique trunk is open. And then, recover the old key from the antique trunk in the bedroom. Then, check that the wooden door is unlocked with the old key. Then, open the wooden door. And then, move east. And then, make absolutely sure that the screen door is open. Having opened the screen door, attempt to head east. With that done, move south. Then, retrieve the apple from the floor of the garden. And then, make an attempt to venture north. If you can succeed at that, head west. With that accomplished, sit the apple on the stove inside the kitchen. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Bedroom =-
Well, here we are in a bedroom.

You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a chest drawer, so there's that. You make out a closed antique trunk in the corner. You make out a king-size bed. The king-size bed is typical. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me see. The user is playing this TextWorld game and has already opened the antique trunk in the bedroom, finding an old key. The next step according to the instructions was to recover the old key from the trunk, which they did. Now they need to check if the wooden door is unlocked with the key. But wait, the wooden door is leading east, and the key is old, so maybe it's the key to the door.

So the next action should be to use the old key on the wooden door. The user has the key now, so they should try unlocking the door. The command would be "unlock wooden door with old key" or something similar. But in TextWorld, the exact phrasing might matter. The previous action was "open antique trunk", so maybe the next step is to "unlock wooden door" using the key. Alternatively, since the key is in the trunk, they might need to use it on the door. The user's next move should be to unlock the door with the key. Let me check the original instructions again.

The original steps said: "check that the wooden door is unlocked with the old key. Then, open the wooden door." So first, they need to unlock it, then open it. So the next action is to unlock the door with the key. The correct command would be "unlock wooden door with old key". But maybe the game expects "use old key on wooden door" or "unlock wooden door". Let me think. Since the key is old, maybe the correct action is to unlock the door with the key. So the next command is "unlock wooden door with old key".

Okay, let me figure out what to do next. The user is in the bedroom, and they've already opened the antique trunk and found an old key. But the previous action was trying to unlock the wooden door with the key, but the system said they need to take the key first.

So, the key is in the antique trunk. The user has the key, right? Wait, when they opened the trunk, the old key was revealed. So they have the key now. Then, they need to unlock the door. But the system said they need to take the key first. Maybe they didn't pick up the key yet.

Wait, the previous action was "unlock wooden door with old key", but the system responded that they need to take the key first. That suggests that the key is still in the trunk and hasn't been taken. So the correct step is to take the key from the trunk first, then use it to unlock the door.

So the next action should be to take the old key from the antique trunk. Then, unlock the door with it. Let me check the previous steps again. The user opened the trunk, which revealed the key. So the key is now in their inventory. But maybe the game requires them to pick it up explicitly. So the next step is to take the key. Then, unlock the door. But the user tried to unlock the door before taking the key, which was incorrect. So the correct next action is to take the key first.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text adventure game. The goal is to follow a series of steps to win. So far, they've opened the antique trunk, found an old key, taken the key, and now they're in the bedroom with the wooden door leading east.

The next step according to the initial instructions was to "check that the wooden door is unlocked with the old key." But the user tried to unlock it right after taking the key. The system responded that they need to take the key first, which makes sense because they hadn't picked it up yet. Wait, no—wait, the user just took the key from the trunk. So maybe the next step is to use the key on the door.

But the user's last action was taking the key, so the next logical step would be to unlock the door with that key. The system's previous message said "You need to take the old key first," which might have been a mistake because the user had already taken the key. But maybe the game requires using the key on the door. So the correct next action would be to unlock the wooden door with the old key. Let me check the previous steps again.

Original steps: After getting the key, check that the wooden door is unlocked with the key, then open it. So the user has the key now. The next action should be to unlock the door. So the command would be "unlock wooden door with old key". But the user might need to first pick up the key if it's not in hand. Wait, in the previous step, the user took the key from the trunk, so the key is in their inventory. Therefore, the next step is to unlock the door with the key. So the correct command is "unlock wooden door with old key".

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps given in the initial instructions. They started by opening the antique trunk, which they did. Then they took the old key and used it to unlock the wooden door. Now, the next step according to the original plan was to move east after unlocking the door.

Wait, the current location is the bedroom, and after unlocking the door, the next action should be to open the wooden door. But the user just unlocked it, so maybe the next step is to move east. Let me check the previous steps again.

The original steps said: after unlocking the wooden door, open it, then move east. But the user already unlocked it. So maybe the next step is to move east. However, the user's last action was unlocking the door, and the next instruction was to move east. But the user hasn't moved yet. So the correct next action should be to move east. But the user is in the bedroom, and the wooden door leads east. So after unlocking, they need to open it, then move east. Wait, but the user just unlocked it. Maybe the door is now open, so they can move east. Let me check the game's state.

In the current state, after unlocking the door, the next step is to move east. The user is in the bedroom, and the wooden door is now unlocked. So the next action should be to move east. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next command should be "go east" or "move east". The game might require the exact command. The initial instructions said "move east" as the next step. So the correct next action is to move east.

Okay, let me figure out what to do next. The user tried to go east but the wooden door wasn't open. Wait, earlier they unlocked the wooden door, right? Let me check the history.

Earlier steps: They opened the antique trunk, took the old key, unlocked the wooden door. Then they tried to go east, but the system said they need to open the door first. Hmm, maybe the door is locked again? Or maybe there's a mistake. Wait, the user just unlocked the door, so maybe the door is now open. But the system is saying they have to open it first. Maybe the door is locked from the other side? Or perhaps the action isn't recognized. Alternatively, maybe after unlocking, they need to open it again. Wait, the original instruction said to "check that the wooden door is unlocked with the old key. Then, open the wooden door." Oh, maybe they unlocked it, but need to open it fully. So the next step should be to open the wooden door again. But the user tried to go east before opening it. So the correct action is to open the door first. So the next command should be "open wooden door".

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text adventure game. The goal is to follow a series of steps to win. So far, they've opened the antique trunk, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door, opened it, and moved east. The next step in the original instructions was to make sure the screen door is open, then head east again, then move south. But the user just opened the wooden door and moved east, so maybe they're now in a new room.

Wait, the current location after opening the wooden door and going east would be the next room. The next step mentioned was to check the screen door. But the user might have already moved east. Let me check the previous steps again. The user was in the bedroom, unlocked the door, opened it, and went east. Now they're probably in the next room, maybe the hallway or another area. The next step according to the original plan was to make sure the screen door is open. So the user needs to check if the screen door is open. If it's not, they need to open it. Then try to go east again. But the user's last action was going east, so maybe they're in a room where the screen door is located. Alternatively, maybe the screen door is in the current room. The user needs to open it before proceeding east again. But the system message says that after opening the wooden door and moving east, the next step is to make sure the screen door is open. So the correct next action would be to open the screen door if it's closed. But the user hasn't mentioned the screen door yet. So the next command should be to open the screen door. But the user's last action was going east, so maybe they are now in a room where the screen door is. Therefore, the next step is to open the screen door. But the user's last action was "go east", which was invalid because the door wasn't open. Wait, no, the user had to open the wooden door first. So after opening the wooden door, they went east, which is correct. Now they are in the next room. The next step is to check the screen door. So the user needs to open the screen door if it's closed. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action should be to open the screen door. But the user's last action was going east, which was allowed after opening the door. Now, the next step is to check the screen door. So the correct next command is to open the screen door. But the user might have to check if it's already open. However, according to the original plan, they need to make sure it's open. So the next action is to open the screen door. Therefore, the answer should be "open screen door".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in the TextWorld game. So far, they've opened the antique trunk, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door, opened it, and now they're trying to open the screen door. But the game says they can't see any screen door.

Hmm, the original instructions mentioned moving east after opening the wooden door, then making sure the screen door is open. But maybe the screen door is not in the current room. Let me check the previous steps again.

After opening the wooden door, the user moved east. Wait, no, the user tried to go east before opening the door. The game corrected them to open the door first. Now, after opening the door, they're in a new room. Maybe the screen door is in that room. But the user tried to open the screen door and it wasn't there. So perhaps the screen door is a different object, or maybe it's a typo. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to look for a screen door in the current room.

But the user's last action was "open screen door", which didn't work. The game's response says they can't see any such thing. So maybe the correct action is to look around for the screen door. But the user is supposed to only output commands like "go north" or "open door". Since the user can't see the screen door, maybe they need to check the current room's description again. However, the user's next action should be based on the previous steps.

Wait, the original plan was: after opening the wooden door, move east, then make sure the screen door is open. But maybe after opening the wooden door, the user is in a room where the screen door is located. But the user tried to open it and it wasn't there. Maybe the screen door is a different object, like a window or a different door. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to look for a screen door in the current room. But since the game didn't mention it, perhaps the user needs to try another approach.

Alternatively, maybe the screen door is a misdirection, and the next step is to proceed east after opening the door. The user might have missed that. Let me check the original instructions again. The user was told to: after opening the wooden door, move east, then make sure the screen door is open. So maybe after opening the door, they should go east, then check the screen door. But the user tried to open the screen door before moving east. So perhaps the correct sequence is: open the door, go east, then check the screen door. But the user is in the room after opening the door. Maybe the screen door is in that room. But the game says they can't see it. So perhaps the user needs to look for it again. But the user can't use "look" command, only actions like "open" or "go".

Alternatively, maybe the screen door is a different object. Maybe the user needs to "open" the screen door, but the game says it's not there. So perhaps the user should try to go east first, then check the screen door. Let me think: after opening the wooden door, the user is in a new room. The next step was to move east. But the user tried to open the screen door first. So maybe the correct action is to go east, then check the screen door. But the user's last action was "open screen door", which failed. So the next step should be to go east, then check the screen door. But the user is supposed to only output the next command. So the next action should be "go east" again. But the user was told to move east after opening the door. So maybe the user needs to go east first, then the screen door will be there. But the user tried to open it before moving. So the correct next step is to go east. But the user is in the room after opening the door. So the next action is "go east".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in this text-based game. The goal is to eventually win by completing certain tasks. Let me recap the current state.

The user started in the Bedroom, opened the antique trunk, took the old key, unlocked the wooden door, opened it, and then moved east to the Kitchen. Now, in the Kitchen, they found a note on the kitchen island. The current score is 5/8, and they need to proceed further.

The next steps according to the original plan were: after opening the screen door, attempt to head east, then move south, retrieve the apple from the garden, venture north, go west, sit the apple on the stove, and win. But the user is now in the Kitchen. Let me check the current environment.

In the Kitchen, there's a closed screen door east, open wooden door west, and exits to north and south. The user's last action was "go east" which led them to the Kitchen. Now, they need to check if the screen door is open. But in the Kitchen description, the screen door is closed. Wait, the user tried to open the screen door earlier but couldn't see it. Then they tried to go east again, which led them here.

Wait, the user's previous action was "open screen door", but the game responded that there's no such thing. Then they tried "go east" again, which moved them to the Kitchen. Now, in the Kitchen, the screen door is closed. So the next step might be to check if the screen door is open. But according to the original plan, after opening the screen door, they need to head east. But in the current location (Kitchen), the screen door is east. So maybe the user needs to open the screen door first.

But the user is in the Kitchen. The screen door is closed. So the correct next step would be to open the screen door. However, the user might have already tried that and failed. Wait, in the previous step, the user tried "open screen door" and the game said they can't see any such thing. But now, in the Kitchen, there is a closed screen door leading east. So maybe the user needs to open that screen door first.

But the original plan said to "make absolutely sure that the screen door is open" before heading east. So the user needs to open the screen door. Therefore, the next action should be to open the screen door. But in the current state, the screen door is closed. So the user should try to open it. However, the game might require the user to first check if it's possible. Alternatively, maybe the user can just try to open it.

So the next action should be "open screen door". But the user might have already tried that. Wait, the user's last action was "go east" which led them to the Kitchen. Now, in the Kitchen, the screen door is closed. Therefore, the correct next step is to open the screen door. So the user should try "open screen door" again. But the game might have a different response. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check if the screen door is open. But according to the game's current state, the screen door is closed. So the user needs to open it first.

Therefore, the next action is "open screen door".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a sequence of steps in this text-based game. The goal is to eventually win by completing certain tasks. Let me recap the current state.

Starting from the bedroom, they opened the antique trunk, took the old key, unlocked the wooden door, opened it, then went east to the kitchen. Then they tried to open the screen door, which they succeeded in doing. Now, the next step according to the original plan was to move east after opening the screen door. But in the kitchen, there's a screen door leading east that's now open. So the next logical step would be to go east again. However, the user just tried to open the screen door again, but the game already allowed them to open it. Wait, the previous action was opening the screen door, and the current location is the kitchen. The kitchen has an open screen door east, so moving east from here would take them to the next area. The original plan said after opening the screen door, attempt to head east. So the next action should be 'go east' again. But the user might have already done that? Wait, no. Let me check the history.

The user was in the kitchen after opening the screen door. The kitchen's description says there's a closed screen door leading east. Wait, no, the previous step was opening the screen door, and the current state shows the screen door is open. So from the kitchen, the screen door east is open. So the next step is to go east. The user's last action was 'open screen door', and now they are in the kitchen. The next action should be 'go east' to proceed. The user's next input should be 'go east' again. But the user might have already done that? Wait, the current location is the kitchen. The kitchen has a screen door east that's open. So the correct next step is to go east. The user's last action was opening the screen door, so now they need to move east. The assistant's previous response was 'go east', which the user did, but the game's response was a kitchen description. Wait, maybe there's confusion here. Let me check the game's current state again.

After opening the screen door in the kitchen, the user is in the kitchen. The kitchen's description mentions an open screen door east. So the next step is to go east from the kitchen. The user's next action should be 'go east' again. The assistant's previous response was 'go east', which the user did, but the game's response was the kitchen's description. Wait, maybe the user is in the kitchen now, and the next step is to go east. The original plan said after opening the screen door, attempt to head east. So the next action is 'go east'. The user's last action was 'open screen door', so the next command should be 'go east'. The assistant should output 'go east' again.

-= Backyard =-
Okay, so you're in a backyard, cool, but is it ordinary? You better believe it is. The room is well lit.

You scan the room for a set of chairs, and you find a set of chairs. The set of chairs appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You see a bbq. The bbq is normal. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a patio table. The patio table is standard. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

There is an open screen door leading west. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a sequence of actions in this text-based game. The goal is to eventually retrieve the apple from the garden and put it on the stove in the kitchen. So far, they've opened the antique trunk, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door, opened it, then went east to the kitchen, opened the screen door, and went east again to the backyard.

Now, in the backyard, the next step according to the original plan was to move south after opening the screen door. But the user just tried to go east again, which might not be correct. Wait, the current location is the backyard. The description says there's an exit to the south. The original plan mentioned after opening the screen door and going east, then moving south. But in the backyard, the exit to the south is unguarded. So maybe the next step is to go south from the backyard. However, the user's last action was "go east", which might have been a mistake because the screen door is already open west, and the exit to the south is available. The user needs to move south to reach the garden where the apple is. So the correct next action should be "go south" to proceed to the garden. But the user might have confused the directions. Let me check the current location again. The backyard has an exit to the south, so moving south would take them to the garden. Therefore, the next action should be "go south".

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps given in the original instructions. They started in the bedroom, opened the antique trunk, took the old key, unlocked the door, opened the wooden door, then went east to the kitchen, opened the screen door, went east again to the backyard, and then went south to the garden.

In the garden, the user needs to retrieve the apple from the floor. The current prompt shows that there's an apple on the floor. So the next logical step is to pick up the apple. The original plan was to retrieve the apple from the garden, so the correct action here would be to take the apple. Then, after getting the apple, they need to go north and then west, but since the user is in the garden now, the immediate next step is to pick up the apple. The user's last action was going south to the garden, so the next command should be to take the apple.

Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game called TextWorld, and they've followed a series of steps to progress. The goal is to retrieve an apple from the garden and then perform other tasks to win.

So far, the player has opened the antique trunk, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door, opened the screen door, and moved east to the garden. In the garden, there's an apple on the floor. The user tried to "take apple from floor," but the game responded that they can't see any such thing. Wait, but the description says there's an apple on the floor. Maybe the command is incorrect. Let me check the previous messages.

Looking back, the garden description says: "There is a lettuce, a tomato plant, an apple and a shovel on the floor." So the apple is indeed there. The user tried "take apple from floor," but the game says they can't see it. Maybe the correct command is just "take apple" without specifying the location, or perhaps "take apple from floor" is the right syntax. But the game says "can't see any such thing," which is confusing because the apple is there.

Wait, maybe the player needs to first check the floor or look around. But the game's prompt says "There is a lettuce, a tomato plant, an apple and a shovel on the floor." So the apple is present. Maybe the correct command is "take apple" without the "from floor" part. Let me think. In text adventures, sometimes you just say "take apple" if it's in the current location. Alternatively, maybe the player needs to pick it up directly.

But the user's previous action was "take apple from floor," which the game rejected. So perhaps the correct command is just "take apple." Let me try that. The user's next action should be "take apple" to pick it up. Then, after taking the apple, the next step is to venture north, then west, and put the apple on the stove in the kitchen. So the next step after taking the apple would be to go north. But first, taking the apple correctly.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps in the game. They started in the bedroom, opened the antique trunk, got the key, unlocked the door, opened the wooden door, then went east to the kitchen, opened the screen door, went east again to the backyard, then south to the garden. In the garden, they picked up the apple.

Now, the next step according to the original instructions was to "make an attempt to venture north. If you can succeed at that, head west. With that accomplished, sit the apple on the stove inside the kitchen. And once you've done that, you win!"

So, after picking up the apple in the garden, the next action should be to go north. The user is in the garden, and there's an unblocked exit to the north. So the correct command here is "go north". Then, after successfully moving north, they need to go west. But first, they have to go north. The user hasn't done that yet. So the next action is "go north".

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps in the game. They started in the bedroom, opened the antique trunk, got the key, unlocked the door, opened the screen door, moved east to the kitchen, then back to the backyard, and now they're in the garden where they picked up the apple. The next step in the original plan was to go north from the garden, which they did, ending up back in the backyard.

Now, the user is at the backyard again. The next step according to the original instructions was to move west after opening the screen door and then sit the apple on the stove in the kitchen. But the user is currently in the backyard. Wait, the previous action was going north from the garden, which brought them back to the backyard. The next step mentioned in the original plan was after retrieving the apple from the garden: "then make an attempt to venture north. If you can succeed at that, head west." So after going north from the garden, they are in the backyard. Then they need to head west.

But in the current state, the user is in the backyard, and the next action should be to go west. However, the backyard has an open screen door leading west. So the correct command here is "go west". That would take them back to the kitchen or another area. But wait, the kitchen was previously visited. Let me check the previous locations.

The user was in the garden, picked up the apple, then went north to the backyard. Now, from the backyard, going west would lead them back to the kitchen, where they need to sit the apple on the stove. So the next action should be "go west" to reach the kitchen, then place the apple on the stove. But the user's last action was "go north", which brought them to the backyard. Now, the next step is to go west. So the correct command here is "go west".

You've just shown up in a kitchen.

Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a refrigerator. You make out a counter. But there isn't a thing on it. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. The stove is standard. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You make out a kitchen island. On the kitchen island you see a note.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

They started by opening the antique trunk, taking the key, unlocking the door, opening the wooden door, then moving east to the kitchen. Then they opened the screen door, went east to the backyard, then south to the garden where they picked up the apple. Now they're back in the kitchen after going west from the backyard.

The next step in the original plan was to sit the apple on the stove inside the kitchen. So the user has the apple now, and they're in the kitchen. The stove is in the kitchen, so the next logical action is to put the apple on the stove. The command should be "put apple on stove". Let me check if that's the correct action here. The user has the apple in their inventory, so putting it on the stove should be the next step. The previous steps have been followed correctly, so this should lead to winning the game.
