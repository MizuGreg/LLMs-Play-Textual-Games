Welcome to another exciting round of TextWorld! First of all, ensure that the antique trunk is open. After opening the antique trunk, take the old key from the antique trunk. And then, unlock the wooden door in the bedroom with the old key. And then, open the wooden door. Then, make an attempt to travel east. Okay, and then, doublecheck that the refrigerator is wide open. Once you have opened the refrigerator, take the bell pepper from the refrigerator. After that, rest the bell pepper on the stove inside the kitchen. That's it!

-= Bedroom =-
Look around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a bedroom.

You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a chest drawer. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You see an antique trunk. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out a king-size bed. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hm. Oh well

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me see. The user is in a TextWorld game. Their goal is to open the antique trunk, take the old key, unlock the wooden door in the bedroom, open it, go east, check the refrigerator, take the bell pepper, put it on the stove. So far, they've opened the antique trunk and got the key. The next step is to unlock the wooden door with the key.

Wait, the current location is the bedroom. The wooden door is closed and leads east. The user has the old key. So the next action should be to use the key on the door. But in TextWorld, the command might be "unlock wooden door" or "use old key on wooden door". But the user's previous action was "open antique trunk", which worked. The system response said the key was inside. Now, the user needs to unlock the door. The correct command here would be "unlock wooden door" since the key is needed. But maybe the game expects "use old key on wooden door". However, the user's previous action was "open", so maybe "unlock" is the right verb here. Let me check the previous steps again. The user was told to "unlock the wooden door in the bedroom with the old key". So the command should be "unlock wooden door". But the key is in hand, so maybe the game requires using the key. Alternatively, maybe "use old key on wooden door". But the user's previous action was "open antique trunk", which was correct. So the next step is to unlock the door. The correct command is likely "unlock wooden door". Let me confirm. The user has the key, so they need to unlock the door. The command would be "unlock wooden door". That's the next step.

Okay, the user is in a TextWorld game. Let me recap the steps they've taken so far. The original goal was to open the antique trunk, take the old key, unlock the wooden door in the bedroom, open it, go east, check the refrigerator, take the bell pepper, and put it on the stove.

So far, they opened the antique trunk and got the old key. Then they tried to unlock the wooden door, but the system responded that the door is fixed in place. Wait, that's confusing. The user was told to unlock the door with the key, but the door isn't opening. Maybe the command was incorrect. Let me think about possible commands. Maybe "unlock wooden door" isn't the right verb here. Perhaps the correct command is "use old key on wooden door" or "open wooden door". But the user tried "unlock wooden door" and it didn't work. The door is closed, so maybe they need to use the key to open it. Alternatively, maybe the door is locked, and the key is needed to unlock it. But the system's response says the door is fixed in place. Maybe the door is locked, and the key isn't working? Or maybe the command is wrong.

Wait, the user's previous action was "unlock wooden door", but the door is fixed. Maybe the correct action is to "open wooden door" instead. But the user was told to unlock it with the key. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the key is not the right item to use. But the user has the old key from the trunk. Maybe the door is locked, and the key is needed to unlock it. So the correct command should be "use old key on wooden door" or "unlock wooden door with old key". But the game might require a specific syntax. Let me check the previous steps again. The user was told to "unlock the wooden door in the bedroom with the old key". So the correct command is likely "unlock wooden door" since the key is in hand. But the system says the door is fixed. Maybe the door is locked, and the key isn't working. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "open" the door instead of "unlock". But the original instruction says to unlock it. This is a bit confusing. Maybe the next step is to try "open wooden door" instead of "unlock". Let me try that. If the door is closed, maybe "open" is the correct verb. So the next action would be "open wooden door".

Okay, the user is stuck again. They tried to open the wooden door but were told they need to unlock it with the old key first. They already have the key from the trunk. So the problem is that the door is locked, and they need to use the key to unlock it. The previous attempt was "unlock wooden door", which didn't work. Maybe the correct command is "use old key on wooden door" or "unlock wooden door with old key". But the game might require a specific syntax. Let me think about the possible commands. In TextWorld, sometimes you have to use the exact phrase. The user was told to "unlock the wooden door in the bedroom with the old key". So the correct command is probably "unlock wooden door" since the key is in hand. But the system says the door is fixed. Wait, maybe the door is locked, and the key isn't working. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "open" the door after unlocking. But the system says they have to unlock first. So the next step is to try using the key on the door. The correct command would be "use old key on wooden door". Let me check if that's the right syntax. Alternatively, maybe "unlock wooden door" is correct. But the system said the door is fixed. Maybe the door is locked, and the key is needed. So the user needs to try "unlock wooden door" again. But the system says it's fixed. Maybe the user needs to "open" the door. But the instruction says to unlock. This is confusing. The user needs to use the key to unlock the door. So the correct command is "unlock wooden door" again. Maybe the system is not recognizing it. Alternatively, maybe the key is not in the correct location. But the user has the key. So the next action is to try "unlock wooden door" again.

Okay, the user is stuck again. They tried to unlock the wooden door but it's still fixed. Let me think. The previous steps: they opened the trunk, got the key, tried to unlock the door, but it's not working. Maybe the key isn't the right one? Or maybe the door is locked with a different mechanism. Wait, the user was told to "unlock the wooden door in the bedroom with the old key". So the key should work. Maybe the command is wrong. Maybe they need to "use old key on wooden door" instead of "unlock". Let me check the possible commands. In TextWorld, sometimes you have to use the exact phrase.

So the command should be "use old key on wooden door". Let me try that. If that doesn't work, maybe the next step is to look for another way. But according to the instructions, the next step after unlocking is to open the door. So maybe the correct command is "unlock wooden door" again. But the system says it's fixed.

Okay, the user is trying to use the old key on the wooden door but got an error because "use" isn't a recognized verb. Let me think about the possible correct commands. In TextWorld, the correct verb might be "unlock" instead of "use". The user previously tried "unlock wooden door" but it didn't work. Maybe the correct command is "unlock wooden door" again, but the system says the door is fixed. Wait, maybe the key is already in hand, so the command should be "unlock door" without specifying "wooden". Or maybe "open door" after unlocking. But the user was told to unlock it with the key. Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "open wooden door" once it's unlocked. But the system says they need to unlock first. This is confusing. The user needs to find the right verb. Since "use" isn't working, maybe "unlock" is the correct verb. Let me try "unlock door" instead of "unlock wooden door". Or maybe "unlock" is the correct verb without specifying the door.

Okay, the user has taken the bell pepper from the refrigerator. Now they need to rest the bell pepper on the stove inside the kitchen. The next step is to go to the stove and place the bell pepper there. The correct command would be "go to stove" or "rest bell pepper on stove". Since the user is in the kitchen, "go to stove" makes sense. But the original instruction says "rest the bell pepper on the stove", so maybe "rest bell pepper on stove" is the correct command. Let me check. The user is holding the bell pepper, so the command should be "rest bell pepper on stove".

That's not a verb I recognise.

Okay, the user is trying to rest the bell pepper on the stove but the command isn't recognized. Let me think about the possible correct commands. The user has the bell pepper, and the stove is in the kitchen. The correct action might be to "put bell pepper on stove" or "place bell pepper on stove". Since "rest" wasn't working, maybe "put" is the right verb. Let me try "put bell pepper on stove".
