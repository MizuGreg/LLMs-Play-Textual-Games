I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is how to play! First stop, open the chest drawer. After that, recover the old key from the chest drawer within the bedroom. Then, check that the wooden door is unlocked with the old key. And then, open the wooden door inside the bedroom. Then, go to the east. And then, look and see that the screen door in the kitchen is ajar. After that, make an effort to venture east. And then, attempt to move south. With that accomplished, lift the bell pepper from the floor of the garden. After that, move north. Okay, and then, attempt to take a trip west. Following that, rest the bell pepper on the stove. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Bedroom =-
You've fallen into an usual room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be usual. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the bedroom.

You can see a closed chest drawer. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just an antique trunk. Hmm. You always thought you'd be more excited to see an antique trunk in a room. You can make out a king-size bed. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me see. The user is in a text-based game where they need to follow a series of steps to win. So far, they've opened the chest drawer in the bedroom and found an old key. The next step according to the initial instructions was to recover the old key from the chest drawer within the bedroom. Wait, but they just did that. Now they need to check if the wooden door is unlocked with the key.

Wait, the user's current location is the bedroom. The chest drawer is closed, but they opened it and got the key. Now, the next step in the original plan was to check that the wooden door is unlocked with the old key. So the next action should be to use the key on the wooden door. But how is that phrased in the game's commands?

Looking at the previous steps, after opening the chest drawer, the user found the key. Now, the wooden door leading east is closed. So the next step is to unlock it with the key. The command would be "unlock the wooden door with the old key" or something similar. But in the game's context, maybe it's "use the old key on the wooden door" or "unlock the wooden door". The exact phrasing depends on the game's accepted commands.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "check that the wooden door is unlocked with the old key", but the game might require an action like "unlock" or "use key". Since the user has the key, they need to use it on the door. So the next action should be to unlock the wooden door with the old key. But the user has to input the command as per the game's syntax. The previous action was "open the chest drawer", so the next logical step is to use the key on the door. Therefore, the correct command is "unlock the wooden door with the old key".

Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they need to follow a series of steps to win. So far, they've opened the chest drawer and found an old key. But the game提示 says they need to take the old key first before unlocking the door. Wait, maybe the key is still in the chest drawer. So the next logical step would be to take the key from the chest drawer. Then, they can use it to unlock the wooden door. Let me check the previous steps again.

The user opened the chest drawer, which revealed the old key. The game message says they need to take the key first. So the correct action here is to take the key. Then, after taking it, they can unlock the door. So the next command should be "take the old key". But the game might have specific commands. Let me make sure. The user is in the bedroom, chest drawer is open, and the key is there. So the correct action is to take the key. Then unlock the door with it. So the next step is to take the key.

The user tried "unlock the wooden door with the old key" and the system said they need to take the key first. Now that they've taken the key, that command should work.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps given in the initial instructions. They started by opening the chest drawer, which they did. Then they recovered the old key, which was inside. Next, they tried to unlock the wooden door with the key, which worked. Now, the next step according to the original plan was to go east after unlocking the door.

Looking at the current state, the wooden door leading east is now unlocked. The next action should be to move east. The user's last action was unlocking the door, so the next logical step is to go east. The response should be "go east" to continue the sequence. The score is increasing as per the steps, so the user is on the right track. They need to proceed to the kitchen as mentioned next, so moving east makes sense. No other actions are needed here. Just "go east" as the next command.

Okay, let's see. The user tried to go east but the wooden door wasn't open yet. The previous step was unlocking the wooden door, which was successful. The score increased, so the door must be unlocked now. The user's next action was "go east", but the game said they have to open the door first. Wait, maybe there's a confusion here. The user already unlocked the door, so perhaps the door is open now. Maybe the game's message is a bit confusing. The correct action after unlocking the door is to go through it. So the next step should be moving east through the door. The user's last action was going east, but the game said they need to open the door first. Maybe the door is locked again? No, the user just unlocked it. Maybe the game's message is a mistake. The correct next step is to go east, so the answer should be "go east".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the steps in the TextWorld game. They started in the bedroom, opened the chest drawer, took the old key, and used it to unlock the wooden door. But then they tried to go east without opening the door first. The game is pointing out that they need to open the door before moving east.

So the user's next action should be to open the wooden door. But wait, they already unlocked it with the key. Maybe the door is locked but not open. Unlocking it might just remove the lock, but to open it, they need to interact with the door again. The game message says "You have to open the wooden door first," so even though they unlocked it, they need to open it physically. So the correct action here is to open the door, not just unlock it. The user might have confused the two actions. The previous step was unlocking, so now they need to open it. Let me check the previous steps again.

Yes, the user unlocked the door with the key, but the door is still closed. So the next step is to open the door. The game is expecting the command "open wooden door" or "open the wooden door". The user tried "go east" again, which is incorrect because the door is closed. So the correct action is to open the door first.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps to progress through the game. They started in the bedroom, opened the chest drawer, took the old key, unlocked the wooden door, and then tried to go east. But the game kept prompting them to open the wooden door first. After several attempts, they finally opened the door, and the score increased.

Now, the next step according to the initial instructions was to go east after opening the door. The user just opened the door, so the next logical step would be to move east. The game's response after opening the door indicates that the score has increased, and the user is now in the next room, which is the kitchen as mentioned in the original instructions. The user needs to check the screen door in the kitchen, which is ajar. Then they should venture east again, but the user might need to confirm if they are in the correct location.

Wait, the user's last action was opening the wooden door, which led them to the kitchen. The next step in the original plan was to look at the screen door in the kitchen. But the user's next action should be to check the screen door. However, the user's previous attempt to go east was blocked because the door wasn't open. Now that the door is open, they can proceed east. But the original plan said after opening the door, go east, look at the screen door, then venture east again, then move south, etc.

So, after opening the door, the user should go east to the kitchen. The game's current state is that they are in the bedroom, having opened the door. The next step is to go east into the kitchen. The user's next command should be "go east" again. But the game might have a different structure. Alternatively, maybe after opening the door, they are now in the kitchen, so they should check the screen door. However, the user's previous attempt to go east was blocked, but after opening the door, they can proceed. So the correct next step is to go east into the kitchen. The user's next action should be "go east".

You make out a closed refrigerator nearby. You can see a counter. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The counter is normal. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a stove. But the thing is empty. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is usual. On the kitchen island you can see a note. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

The current scene describes the kitchen with a refrigerator, a counter, a kitchen island with a note, a screen door east, a wooden door west, and an exit north. The hint says to try going south.

Wait, the user's goal is to eventually lift the bell pepper in the garden and then rest it on the stove. So far, they've unlocked the door and moved into the kitchen. The next step mentioned in the original instructions was to "look and see that the screen door in the kitchen is ajar" and then "venture east" and "attempt to move south." But in the current state, the screen door is closed (since it's listed as closed), but the user is told to try going south. However, the kitchen's description says there's an unblocked exit to the north. But the user's next action should follow the original plan.

Wait, the original plan after entering the kitchen was to "look and see that the screen door in the kitchen is ajar. After that, make an effort to venture east. And then, attempt to move south." But in the current state, the screen door is closed. However, the user is in the kitchen, and the next step according to the game's current state might be to go south. But the kitchen's description says there's an exit to the north. Maybe the user is supposed to go south from the kitchen. But the kitchen's description says "You need an unguarded exit?

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text adventure game, and they've been moving through different rooms. The goal is to follow a series of steps to win. Let me recap the current state.

They started in the bedroom, opened the chest drawer, took the old key, unlocked the wooden door, and went east to the kitchen. Then they went south to the living room and back north to the kitchen again. Now, they're in the kitchen again, score 5/11. The next step according to the original instructions was to go east, look at the screen door, then venture east, attempt to move south, pick up the bell pepper in the garden, move north, then go west, rest the bell pepper on the stove, and win.

But the user's current position is the kitchen. The kitchen has a closed screen door east, open wooden door west, and unblocked exit north. The previous action was going north from the living room back to the kitchen. Now, the next step in the original plan was to go east from the kitchen (screen door), then attempt to move south. But the user is at the kitchen again. So the next action should be to go east to the screen door, then check what's there. But the user's last action was going north, so maybe they need to go east now.

Wait, the user's last input was "go north" leading back to the kitchen. Now, the prompt says to go east from the kitchen. So the next command should be "go east" to open the screen door. Then, after that, the next step is to attempt to move south. But the user is in the kitchen, so after going east to the screen door, maybe they can move south from there? Or perhaps the screen door is ajar, so they can go through it. But the original instructions said after checking the screen door is ajar, then venture east, then attempt to move south. So maybe after going east (screen door), they need to move south. But the user is in the kitchen, so going east would take them to the screen door's other side, maybe the garden? Or another room?

Alternatively, maybe the screen door is ajar, so they can go through it. But the user needs to check that the screen door is ajar. The original instruction says "look and see that the screen door in the kitchen is ajar. After that, make an effort to venture east." So the user needs to check the screen door is open, then go east. But in the current kitchen description, the screen door is closed. Wait, the kitchen description says "closed screen door leading east." So the user needs to open it? But the original plan said the screen door is ajar. Wait, maybe there's a mistake here. Let me check the original steps again.

Original steps: "look and see that the screen door in the kitchen is ajar. After that, make an effort to venture east." But in the current kitchen description, the screen door is closed. So maybe the user hasn't opened it yet. Therefore, the next step is to open the screen door. But the user hasn't done that yet. However, the user's last action was going north, leading back to the kitchen. So the next action should be to check the screen door. But according to the game's current state, the screen door is closed. So perhaps the user needs to open it first. But the original plan said the screen door is ajar. Maybe there's a discrepancy here. Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go east through the screen door even if it's closed, but that's not possible. Therefore, the correct next step is to open the screen door. But the user hasn't done that yet. However, the original instructions said to look and see it's ajar. But in the current game state, it's closed. So maybe the user needs to open it. But how? The user might need to find a key or another way. But the user has the old key, which was used to unlock the wooden door. Maybe the screen door can be opened with the key? Or maybe there's another way. Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to proceed despite it being closed, but that's not possible. Therefore, the correct next action is to open the screen door. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next command should be "open screen door". But the user's previous action was going north, so now they need to check the screen door. However, the game's current state says the screen door is closed. Therefore, the user needs to open it. But the user hasn't done that yet. Therefore, the next action is to open the screen door. However, the original plan said the screen door is ajar. So maybe there's a mistake in the game's current state. But the user has to follow the game's current state. Therefore, the next action is to open the screen door. But the user might not have the key for it. Alternatively, maybe the screen door is ajar, but the game description says it's closed. This is confusing. Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go east even if it's closed, but that's not possible. Therefore, the correct next action is to open the screen door. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the answer is "open screen door".

Okay, let's see. The user is in the kitchen, and they just opened the screen door. The next step according to the original plan was to venture east after opening the screen door. But wait, the previous steps mentioned going east from the kitchen. However, the current location is the kitchen, and after opening the screen door, the next action should be to go east. But I need to check the environment description again.

Looking at the kitchen description, there's a closed screen door leading east and an open wooden door leading west. The user just opened the screen door, so now they can go east. The original goal was to move east from the kitchen, so the next action should be "go east". But the user might have already done that? Wait, the previous step was in the kitchen, and the user just opened the screen door. The next logical step is to go through the screen door east. So the correct command is "go east".

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps in the game, moving through different rooms and completing tasks. The current location is the Backyard. The goal was to lift the bell pepper from the garden, then move north, then west, and rest the bell pepper on the stove. But so far, the user has opened the screen door in the kitchen, gone east to the backyard, and now is in the backyard.

The next step according to the original plan was to move south from the backyard. The user's last action was going east to the backyard, and now the prompt says to try going south from the backyard. The user's next action should be "go south" to continue towards the garden where the bell pepper is located. The score is at 7/13, so they're making progress. The user needs to follow the sequence: after the backyard, go south to the garden, pick up the bell pepper, then move north, then west, and finally rest the bell pepper on the stove. So the correct next command is "go south".

The next step according to the original plan is to lift the bell pepper. The user needs to pick it up. The command should be "take bell pepper" or "lift bell pepper". But in TextWorld, the correct command is usually "take" for picking up items. So the next action should be "take bell pepper".

Okay, the user has to follow a series of steps in the TextWorld game. Let me recap the current state. They've opened the chest drawer, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door, went east to the kitchen, then south to the living room, back to the kitchen, opened the screen door, went east to the backyard, then south to the garden. In the garden, they picked up the bell pepper.

The next step according to the original instructions was to move north after taking the bell pepper. The user's last action was taking the bell pepper, so the next command should be "move north" to proceed. Let me check if there are any other steps needed. The original plan said after picking up the bell pepper, move north, then attempt to take a trip west, then rest the bell pepper on the stove. But the user has to follow each step one by one. Since the current location is the garden, moving north would take them back to the backyard or another area. Wait, in the garden description, it says "You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked." So moving north from the garden is possible. After moving north, they might be in the backyard again. Then the next step is to attempt to move west, but first, they need to rest the bell pepper on the stove. But the stove is in the kitchen. So maybe after moving north, they need to go back to the kitchen, then to the stove. But according to the original instructions, after picking up the bell pepper in the garden, they should move north, then attempt to take a trip west. Wait, the original steps said: "After that, move north. Okay, and then, attempt to take a trip west. Following that, rest the bell pepper on the stove." So after moving north, the next action is to go west. But where is the stove? The stove is in the kitchen. So perhaps after moving north, they need to go west to the kitchen, then rest the bell pepper on the stove. But the user is in the garden, so moving north would take them to the backyard. Then from the backyard, moving west would take them back to the kitchen. Then they can go to the stove. But the user's next action after taking the bell pepper is to move north. So the correct command here is "move north".

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Garden scene. They picked up the bell pepper and tried to move north. The game responded with "You must name something more substantial." So, the system is expecting a more specific action.

Looking back at the instructions, after taking the bell pepper, the next step was to move north. But the game is prompting for a more substantial action. Maybe "move north" isn't sufficient here. The user needs to interact with the bell pepper in a different way. 

Wait, the original goal mentioned lifting the bell pepper from the floor of the garden and then moving north. But after taking it, the next step was to move north. However, the game is not accepting "move north" again. Maybe the correct action is to rest the bell pepper on the stove. But the user hasn't been to the kitchen yet. 

Wait, the user was in the Garden, took the bell pepper, then tried to move north. The game says "must name something more substantial." Maybe the user needs to put the bell pepper down somewhere. But the original steps said to rest it on the stove. However, the stove is in the kitchen. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to take the bell pepper and then go north, but the game is expecting a different command. The previous step was moving north, but the system is not allowing it. Maybe the correct action is to "rest bell pepper on stove" but the user hasn't reached the kitchen yet. 

Wait, the user's last action was moving north, but the game is not accepting it. The user is in the Garden, and the next step after taking the bell pepper is to move north. But the system is prompting for a more substantial action. Maybe the user needs to "rest bell pepper on stove" even though they are in the Garden. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to take the bell pepper and then go north to the kitchen, but the system is not allowing "move north" again. Maybe the correct action is to "put bell pepper on stove" even though the stove is in the kitchen. But the user hasn't gone there yet. 

Wait, the original instructions said: "lift the bell pepper from the floor of the garden. After that, move north. Okay, and then, attempt to take a trip west. Following that, rest the bell pepper on the stove." So after moving north, the user would be in the kitchen, then go west, then rest the bell pepper on the stove. 

But in the current state, the user is in the Garden, has the bell pepper, and needs to move north. The game is not allowing "move north" again. Maybe the user needs to "rest bell pepper on stove" even though they are in the Garden. But that's not possible. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to "put bell pepper on stove" even though they are in the Garden. But the stove is in the kitchen. So the correct sequence is: take bell pepper, move north to kitchen, then rest it on the stove. But the user is in the Garden, so they need to move north first.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to rest the bell pepper on the stove. The previous command was "rest bell pepper on stove", but the system said that's not a recognized verb.

Hmm, so maybe the correct action is to put the bell pepper on the stove. The word "put" is a common verb for placing items. Alternatively, maybe "place" is the right verb here. Let me check the game's possible commands. Since the user has the bell pepper in hand, the action should be to put it on the stove. The system might expect "put" instead of "rest".

Earlier, in the Kitchen, there's a stove, but the user is currently in the Garden.

So, the problem is that the stove isn't in the Garden. The user tried "rest bell pepper on stove" and "put bell pepper on stove", but the game says they can't see the stove here. Therefore, the correct action would be to move to the Kitchen where the stove is located. The user was in the Garden, and the previous move was moving north from the Garden to the Kitchen. Wait, no, when they were in the Garden, they moved north, but the response was about the Garden. Wait, let me check the history.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the steps given in the initial instructions. They started in the bedroom, opened the chest drawer, took the old key, unlocked the door, and went east to the kitchen. Then they moved around, eventually getting to the garden where they picked up the bell pepper. The next step was to rest the bell pepper on the stove, but the system didn't recognize that command.

So, the user tried "rest bell pepper on stove" but got an error. Then they tried "put bell pepper on stove", which also didn't work. The system said they can't see any such thing. Then the user went back to the backyard, and now they're at the backyard again. The next action they tried was "go north", which took them back to the garden. But they need to put the bell pepper on the stove. 

Wait, maybe the stove is in the kitchen. The user is currently in the backyard. They have the bell pepper. They need to go back to the kitchen, find the stove, and put the bell pepper there. But the previous attempt to go north from the garden led them back to the backyard. So maybe they need to go south from the backyard to get back to the garden, then go north to the kitchen? Or maybe the stove is in the kitchen, so they need to go back to the kitchen.

But in the current state, they're in the backyard. The previous step was "go north" which took them back to the garden. Now they need to find a way to get to the kitchen again. Let me check the previous locations. The user was in the garden, then went north to the backyard. Now they need to go back to the kitchen. The kitchen has an unblocked exit to the north, but maybe they need to go west from the backyard through the screen door. Wait, in the backyard, there's an open screen door leading west, which would take them back to the kitchen. So the correct path is: from the backyard, go west through the screen door to the kitchen, then find the stove and put the bell pepper there.

But the user is currently in the backyard. The next action should be to go west through the screen door to the kitchen. Then, in the kitchen, they can go north to the living room, but maybe the stove is in the kitchen. Wait, in the kitchen description, there's a stove mentioned. So once in the kitchen, they can put the bell pepper on the stove. So the next step is to go west from the backyard to the kitchen, then put the bell pepper on the stove. But the user is at the backyard, so the next command should be "go west" to reach the kitchen. Then, in the kitchen, they can "put bell pepper on stove". But the system might not recognize that command, so maybe the correct verb is "put" or "place". Alternatively, maybe the stove is in the kitchen, and once there, they can use the correct command.

So the user's next action should be to go west from the backyard to the kitchen, then put the bell pepper on the stove. But the current location is the backyard, so the next command is "go west".

But the thing is empty. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is usual. On the kitchen island you can see a note. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the steps in the game. They've been moving through different rooms, collecting items like the old key and the bell pepper. The goal is to rest the bell pepper on the stove, but they kept getting stuck because the stove wasn't in the garden.

So, after trying to put the bell pepper on the stove in the garden, the game said they couldn't see the stove. Then they went back to the kitchen, but the stove isn't mentioned there. Wait, maybe the stove is in the kitchen? But the user was in the garden, took the bell pepper, and tried to go north to the backyard, then west to the kitchen. But the kitchen description doesn't mention a stove. Hmm.

Wait, the original instructions said to rest the bell pepper on the stove after moving north. But in the garden, when they went north, they ended up in the backyard, then west to the kitchen. But the kitchen doesn't have a stove. Maybe the stove is in the living room? Or maybe the user needs to go back to the kitchen and check again. Alternatively, maybe the stove is in the kitchen island area. The kitchen island has a note, but no stove mentioned. 

Wait, the user tried to put the bell pepper on the stove but couldn't. So maybe the stove is in the kitchen, but the user hasn't checked there yet. But when they were in the kitchen, the description didn't mention a stove. Maybe the stove is part of the kitchen island? Or perhaps the user needs to go to the living room? The living room has a TV and a couch, but no stove. 

Wait, the original plan was: after taking the bell pepper, move north to the garden, then rest it on the stove. But the garden's description says there's a lettuce, bell pepper, apple, and shovel. No stove there. So maybe the stove is in the kitchen, but the user hasn't found it yet. But when they were in the kitchen, the description didn't mention a stove. Maybe the stove is in the living room? Or maybe the user needs to check the kitchen island again. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go to the backyard again and check the patio table or something else. But the original goal was to rest the bell pepper on the stove. Since the user is in the kitchen now, maybe they need to look for the stove there. But the kitchen description doesn't mention a stove. Maybe the stove is part of the kitchen island? Or maybe the user made a mistake in the steps. 

Wait, the user's last action was going west from the backyard to the kitchen. Now, in the kitchen, they need to find the stove. But the kitchen description doesn't mention a stove. Maybe the stove is in the kitchen island, but the user hasn't checked there. So the next step would be to look around the kitchen for the stove. But the game's responses are limited to commands like "look" or "check". However, the user is supposed to only give commands like "go north" or "take item". 

Since the user is in the kitchen and the stove isn't mentioned, maybe they need to go to the kitchen island and check there. But the kitchen island is described as usual, with a note. Maybe the stove is there. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go back to the garden and try again. But the original plan was to rest the bell pepper on the stove, which is in the garden. Wait, no, the garden's description doesn't mention a stove. 

This is confusing. The user might have made a mistake in the steps. The original instructions said to rest the bell pepper on the stove after moving north. But the garden doesn't have a stove. Maybe the stove is in the kitchen, but the user hasn't found it yet. So the next step would be to look around the kitchen for the stove. But the game doesn't allow "look" commands, only movement. So maybe the user needs to go to the kitchen island and check if the stove is there. But the user can't do that unless they can move to the kitchen island. 

Alternatively, maybe the stove is in the living room. But the user hasn't been there yet. The user is in the kitchen now. So the next step would be to go north from the kitchen to the living room. But the kitchen's description says there's an unblocked exit to the north. So the user should go north to the living room. Then, in the living room, check if the stove is there. But the living room description doesn't mention a stove. 

Hmm, this is a problem. The user needs to rest the bell pepper on the stove, but the stove isn't in any of the rooms they've checked. Maybe there's a mistake in the game's setup, or the user needs to find the stove in a different way. Alternatively, maybe the stove is in the backyard. But the backyard doesn't mention a stove either. 

Wait, the user is in the kitchen now. The kitchen has a stove? Maybe the stove is part of the kitchen, but the description didn't mention it. The user might need to try to use the "put bell pepper on stove" command again, even though the game says they can't see the stove. Maybe the game is expecting that command even if it's not explicitly mentioned. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go to the kitchen island and check there. The kitchen island has a note. Maybe the stove is there. So the user should go to the kitchen island. But how? The kitchen description says there's a kitchen island. So the user can go to the kitchen island. But the user is in the kitchen, so maybe they can move to the kitchen island. 

But the user's last action was going west to the kitchen. Now, in the kitchen, they need to go to the kitchen island. But the game's commands don't allow that. The user can only move between rooms. So maybe the user needs to go to the kitchen island by moving there. But the kitchen description says the kitchen island is usual. So the user can go to the kitchen island. 

But the user is in the kitchen, and the kitchen island is part of the kitchen. So the user can move to the kitchen island. Then, maybe the stove is there. So the next step would be to go to the kitchen island. But the user can't do that unless they can move there. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go back to the garden, but that's not helpful. 

This is a bit of a puzzle. The user needs to rest the bell pepper on the stove. The stove is probably in the kitchen, but the description didn't mention it. So the user should try to use the "put bell pepper on stove" command again, even though the game says they can't see the stove. Maybe the game is expecting that command. 

Alternatively, the user might have made a mistake in the steps. The original plan was to go to the garden, rest the bell pepper on the stove, but the stove isn't there. So maybe the stove is in the kitchen. The user needs to go to the kitchen and put the bell pepper on the stove there. 

But the user is in the kitchen now. So the next step would be to try putting the bell pepper on the stove, even though the game says they can't see it. Maybe the game is expecting that command. 

So the user's next action should be "put bell pepper on stove" again, even though the game says they can't see the stove. Maybe the game is expecting that. 

But the user tried that and got an error. So maybe the correct step is to go to the kitchen island and check there. But the user can't move there. 

Alternatively, the user needs to go back to the garden and try again. But that's not helpful. 

I think the correct next step is to try "put bell pepper on stove" again, even though the game says they can't see it. Maybe the game is expecting that command. So the user should try that again.
