Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an fast paced round of TextWorld? You do! Here is your task for today. First of all, you could, like, make sure that the chest drawer is wide open. After opening the chest drawer, pick up the old key from the chest drawer. Having got the old key, make sure that the wooden door is unlocked with the old key. And then, open the wooden door. After that, travel east. That done, ensure that the refrigerator inside the kitchen is open. And then, recover the apple from the refrigerator. After taking the apple, rest the apple on the stove in the kitchen. Alright, thanks!

-= Bedroom =-
You arrive in a bedroom. An ordinary kind of place. You can barely contain your excitement.

Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a chest drawer. Now why would someone leave that there? If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's an antique trunk. You can see a king-size bed. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The king-size bed is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me see. The user is in a TextWorld game and has already opened the chest drawer and picked up the old key. The next step according to the original task was to unlock the wooden door with the old key. So the next action should be to use the key on the door.

Wait, the current location is the bedroom, and there's a closed wooden door leading east. The user has the old key, so they need to unlock the door. The command would be to unlock the door with the key. But in TextWorld, the exact command might be "unlock wooden door with old key" or something similar. But the user has to make sure the door is unlocked first. So the next step is to unlock the door using the old key. Then, after unlocking, open the door by going east. Then proceed to the kitchen, open the refrigerator, get the apple, put it on the stove. 

But the user's current step is to unlock the door. So the next command should be to unlock the wooden door with the old key. Let me check the previous steps again. The user was told to "make sure that the wooden door is unlocked with the old key. And then, open the wooden door." So first, unlock it, then open. But maybe in the game, unlocking is part of opening. Alternatively, maybe the door is locked, so you need to unlock it first. So the correct action here is to unlock the door with the key. So the next command is "unlock wooden door with old key".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in the TextWorld game. The current situation is in the bedroom. They first opened the chest drawer and found an old key. Then they tried to unlock the wooden door with the key, but the system said they need to take the key first.

Wait, maybe the key is still in the chest drawer. So after opening the chest drawer, they picked up the key. But in the previous step, they tried to unlock the door with the key, but the system said they need to take the key first. That suggests that the key isn't in their inventory yet. So the correct action would be to pick up the key from the chest drawer first, then use it to unlock the door.

But in the previous move, the user tried to unlock the door with the key, but the system said they need to take the key first. So the mistake was that the key wasn't picked up yet. So the next step should be to take the old key from the chest drawer. Wait, but the user already opened the chest drawer and the key was there. So maybe the next step is to pick up the key. But the user didn't do that yet. So the correct action is to take the old key from the chest drawer. Then, after taking it, unlock the door with the key. So the next action should be to take the key. But the user's previous action was trying to unlock the door before taking the key. So the system is pointing out that the key hasn't been taken yet. Therefore, the next action should be to take the key. But the user's last action was trying to unlock the door, which was incorrect. So the correct next step is to take the key first. So the next command should be "take old key" or "take key from chest drawer". But in the game's context, the key is in the chest drawer, so the correct command is "take old key" or "take key". But the user has already opened the chest drawer, so the key is accessible. Therefore, the next action is to take the key. Then, after that, unlock the door. So the next action is to take the key.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this TextWorld game, and they've been following a set of instructions to open a chest drawer, get an old key, unlock a door, and then proceed east. So far, they've opened the chest drawer, taken the old key, and now they need to unlock the wooden door with that key.

The previous step was taking the old key, and the next logical step would be to unlock the door. The user's last action was taking the key, so the next command should be to unlock the wooden door using the old key. The system message says to only output the action, so the correct response here is "unlock wooden door with old key". That makes sense because the user has the key now, and the next step in the task is to unlock the door. Let me make sure there's no mistake here. The task said to unlock the wooden door with the old key after getting it. Yes, that's exactly what's needed now. So the next action is correct.

Okay, let's see. The user has to follow a series of steps in the TextWorld game. So far, they've opened the chest drawer, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door, and then they were told to go east after opening the door. Wait, the original task said after unlocking the wooden door, they need to open it. Wait, the user just unlocked it, so maybe the next step is to open it? Or maybe "unlock" and "open" are different actions here.

Looking back at the original instructions: "make sure that the wooden door is unlocked with the old key. And then, open the wooden door." So first, unlock it using the key, then open it. The user just unlocked it, so the next step should be to open the door. But in the previous step, the user said "unlock wooden door with old key", which worked. Now, the next step according to the original plan is to open the wooden door. So the next action should be "open wooden door". Then, after that, travel east. Then go to the kitchen, open the fridge, get the apple, put it on the stove.

So the current state after unlocking is the next step is to open the door. So the correct command here is "open wooden door".

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps given in the initial task. They started by opening the chest drawer, taking the old key, unlocking the wooden door, and then opening it. Now they're in the next room, which is the kitchen based on the previous steps.

The next step according to the original task was to travel east after opening the wooden door. But the user just opened the door, so the next logical step would be to move east. However, the current location after opening the door is the bedroom, so moving east would take them to the next room, which is the kitchen. 

Wait, the user's last action was opening the wooden door, which leads east. So the next action should be to go east. But the user's previous action was already opening the door, so the next command should be "go east" to enter the kitchen. Then, they need to check the refrigerator, open it, take the apple, and put it on the stove. 

But the user's current prompt is after opening the door, so the next step is to move east. The assistant should respond with "go east" to proceed to the kitchen. The user's previous actions have been correct, so continuing with "go east" makes sense here.

-= Kitchen =-
You've entered a kitchen.

Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a refrigerator. Now why would someone leave that there? You see a counter. The counter is typical. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a stove. The stove is standard. But there isn't a thing on it. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. Oh, great. Here's a kitchen island. The kitchen island is usual. On the kitchen island you can make out a note. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this!

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Okay, let's see. The user has to follow a series of steps to complete the game. So far, they've opened the chest drawer, taken the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, then went east into the kitchen. The next step in the original task was to ensure the refrigerator inside the kitchen is open. The user hasn't done that yet.

Looking at the current environment in the kitchen, the user sees a refrigerator. The task is to open it. The game's current state mentions the refrigerator is closed. So the next action should be to open the refrigerator. Then, after opening it, they need to recover the apple from inside. But the user's next move should be to open the refrigerator first. The previous action was going east, so the next command should be "open refrigerator". Let me check if there are any other steps or possible mistakes. The user has to make sure they open the fridge, then take the apple, then put it on the stove. So the immediate next action is opening the refrigerator.

So far, they've opened the chest drawer, taken the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, then went east into the kitchen. They opened the refrigerator, took the apple. Now the next step according to the original task was to rest the apple on the stove in the kitchen.

Looking at the current location, the kitchen has a stove mentioned. The user has the apple in hand. So the next logical step is to go to the stove and put the apple there. The command should be "put apple on stove". But wait, in TextWorld, sometimes you need to specify the object and the target. So maybe "put apple on stove" is correct here. Let me check the previous actions. The user took the apple, so they have it. The stove is in the kitchen. So yes, the next action is to put the apple on the stove. That's the next step in the task. The user's score is increasing, so they're on the right track. Alright, the answer should be "put apple on stove".
