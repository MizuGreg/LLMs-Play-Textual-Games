It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First thing I need you to do is to make absolutely sure that the antique trunk is opened. And then, take the old key from the antique trunk within the bedroom. After that, check that the wooden door within the bedroom is unlocked with the old key. After that, look and see that the wooden door is open. After that, try to move east. After that, open the screen door in the kitchen. And then, venture east. Then, attempt to travel south. And then, lift the lettuce from the floor of the garden. If you have picked up the lettuce, travel north. And then, try to move west. Then, rest the lettuce on the stove. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Bedroom =-
I am excited to announce that you are now in the bedroom. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You make out a chest drawer. Hmm. You always thought you'd be more excited to see a chest drawer in a room. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to an antique trunk. You can make out a king-size bed. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me see. The user is in the bedroom and just opened the antique trunk, which gave them an old key. The next step according to the task was to take the old key from the trunk. So after opening the trunk, the next logical step is to pick up the key.

Wait, the user's previous action was "open antique trunk", and the response was that the trunk reveals an old key. Now the user is asking if they're on the right track and what the next action should be. The user's score is up to 1/2, so they need to continue following the steps.

The original task says after opening the trunk, take the old key. So the next command should be "take old key". Then, check if the wooden door is unlocked with the key. But the user hasn't done that yet. But the user's current prompt is asking for the next action after confirming the steps so far. So the immediate next step is to take the key. Then proceed to unlock the door. But the user's question is whether they're close. The user is in the bedroom, so after taking the key, they need to unlock the door. But the user's next action should be "take old key" here. Then, after that, check the door. But the user's current prompt is asking for the next action, so the answer should be "take old key".

Okay, the user has taken the old key from the trunk. The next step according to the task is to check that the wooden door in the bedroom is unlocked with the old key. So the next action should be to unlock the door. The command would be "unlock wooden door with old key". But I need to make sure the syntax is correct. In TextWorld, the command might be "unlock wooden door" using the key. Wait, the user has the key in their inventory, so the correct command is "unlock wooden door". The game might automatically use the key if it's the right item. So the next action is "unlock wooden door".

Okay, the user has just unlocked the wooden door. The next step according to the task is to check that the door is open. So after unlocking, they need to verify if the door is open. The command would be "open wooden door" or "check wooden door". But in TextWorld, maybe the correct command is "open wooden door". However, since the door was unlocked, perhaps the action is to open it. Wait, the task says "check that the wooden door within the bedroom is unlocked" and then "look and see that the wooden door is open". So after unlocking, the next step is to open the door. So the command should be "open wooden door". Then, after that, move east. So the next action is "open wooden door".

You shudder, but continue examining the patio table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.
