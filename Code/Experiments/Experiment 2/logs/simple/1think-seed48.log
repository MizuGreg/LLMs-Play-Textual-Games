-= Bedroom =-
You've entered a bedroom.

You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a chest drawer! You make out a closed antique trunk in the room. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a king-size bed. The king-size bed is normal. But there isn't a thing on it.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me see. The user is playing this text-based game and has already opened the chest drawer in the bedroom, which revealed an old key. The next steps according to the initial instructions were to recover the old key from the chest drawer, then unlock the wooden door inside the bedroom with that key, check if the door is ajar, then go east, open the refrigerator, get the tomato plant, put it on the stove, and win.

Wait, the user just opened the chest drawer and found the key. So the next step should be to take the key. The instruction says "recover the old key from the chest drawer within the bedroom." So after opening the drawer, the key is inside, so the next action should be to take the key. Then, use that key to unlock the wooden door. But the current prompt shows that the wooden door is closed. So after taking the key, the user needs to unlock the door. Then check if it's ajar. Then go east. Then proceed with the fridge and tomato plant.

But the user's last action was opening the chest drawer. The next step is to take the key. So the correct command here is "take old key" or "take key". But in the game's context, maybe the exact wording matters. The initial instruction says "recover the old key from the chest drawer", so the action would be to take it. So the next command should be "take old key".

Okay, the user has taken the old key from the chest drawer. The next step according to the plan is to unlock the wooden door inside the bedroom with the key. So the action should be "unlock wooden door" or "unlock door with old key". But the game might require specific commands. Since the door is closed, using the key to unlock it would be the next logical step. The command would be "unlock wooden door" or maybe "unlock door". But the exact wording might matter. The previous steps were "open chest drawer" and "take old key", so now it's time to use the key on the door. The correct command here is "unlock wooden door".

Okay, the user has unlocked the wooden door. The next step according to the instructions is to check if the door is ajar. So the action would be "open wooden door" or "check door". But since the door was just unlocked, maybe it's already ajar. The original plan says "check that the wooden door inside the bedroom is unlocked with the old key. And then, look and see that the wooden door inside the bedroom is ajar." So after unlocking, the next step is to check if it's ajar. The command would be "open wooden door" to see if it's ajar. Alternatively, maybe "look at wooden door" but the game might expect "open" to check if it's ajar. So the next action is "open wooden door".

-= Kitchen =-
You're now in the kitchen.

You make out a refrigerator. You make out a counter. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a stove. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You make out a kitchen island. The kitchen island is standard. On the kitchen island you make out a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.
