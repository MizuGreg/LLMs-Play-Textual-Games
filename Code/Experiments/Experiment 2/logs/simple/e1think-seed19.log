Welcome to another life changing episode of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, you could, like, doublecheck that the chest drawer is opened. Once you have opened the chest drawer, recover the old key from the chest drawer within the bedroom. And then, unlock the wooden door. Then, open the wooden door. Once you have opened the wooden door, attempt to go to the east. With that accomplished, make absolutely sure that the refrigerator within the kitchen is ajar. Then, pick up the milk from the refrigerator. After taking the milk, sit the milk on the stove. Got that? Good!

-= Bedroom =-
You've entered a bedroom. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

You make out a chest drawer. You see a closed antique trunk. You can see a king-size bed. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. This always happens, here in TextWorld!

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me see. The user has already opened the chest drawer and found the old key. The next step according to the task was to recover the old key from the chest drawer within the bedroom. Since they just did that, the next thing is to unlock the wooden door. Wait, the wooden door is closed, right? The description says there's a closed wooden door leading east. So I need to use the key to unlock it. But wait, the task says "unlock the wooden door. Then, open the wooden door." So first, unlock it, then open it. But how? Maybe the key is for the lock on the door. So the next action should be to unlock the door with the key. But in TextWorld, sometimes you just use the key on the door. So the command would be "unlock wooden door" or "use key on wooden door". But the user has the key now, so maybe "unlock wooden door" is the correct command here. Let me check the previous steps again. The user opened the chest drawer and got the key. Now they need to unlock the door. So the next action is to unlock the wooden door. Then after that, open it. So the next command should be "unlock wooden door".

Okay, let me figure out what to do next. The user has already opened the chest drawer and found the old key. Then they tried to unlock the wooden door, but it's fixed in place. Wait, the original task was to unlock the wooden door after recovering the key from the chest drawer. But the door is closed, so maybe the key is needed to unlock it.

Wait, the user just tried to unlock the wooden door, but the door is fixed. Maybe the key is required to unlock it. Since the key was found in the chest drawer, the next step should be to use the key on the door. But the current state says the door is fixed. So perhaps the correct action is to try unlocking the door with the key. But the user's previous action was "unlock wooden door", which didn't work. So maybe the next step is to use the key on the door. But how is that done in the game? The command might be "use key on wooden door" or "unlock wooden door with key". But the game might expect a specific command. Alternatively, maybe the door can be opened by using the key. Let me check the previous steps again.

The user's previous action was "unlock wooden door", but the response was that the door is fixed. So maybe the key is needed. So the next action should be to use the key to unlock the door. The correct command would be "unlock wooden door" again, but since it's fixed, maybe the key is required. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the key on the door. But the game's possible commands might be limited. The user has the key now, so the next step is to unlock the door with the key. Therefore, the next action should be "unlock wooden door" again, but perhaps the game will accept it now. Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "use key on wooden door". But the user's previous action was "unlock wooden door", which didn't work. So maybe the correct action is to try unlocking the door again, as the key is now in hand. So the next command is "unlock wooden door".

Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they need to follow a series of steps. The current scenario is in the bedroom. They've already opened the chest drawer and found an old key. Then they tried to unlock the wooden door, but it's fixed in place. The user is now asking if they're on the right track and what their next move should be.

First, I need to recall the original goal. The user had to open the chest drawer, get the key, unlock the wooden door, open it, go east, check the fridge, get milk, and put it on the stove. So far, they've done the first three steps: opened the chest, got the key, tried to unlock the door. But the door is fixed, so maybe they need to use the key to unlock it. Wait, the instruction said to "unlock the wooden door" after getting the key. But the door is fixed, so maybe the key is needed to unlock it. However, the user tried to unlock it without the key, which didn't work. So the next logical step is to use the key to unlock the door. But in the game, the action might be "use key on door" or "unlock door with key". But the previous action was "unlock wooden door", which didn't work. So maybe the correct action is to use the key. But the game's response says the door is fixed, so perhaps the key is needed. Therefore, the next step should be to use the key to unlock the door. But the user's last action was "unlock wooden door", which didn't work. So the next action should be to use the key on the door. However, the game might require the exact command. Let me check the previous interactions. The user first opened the chest drawer, then tried to unlock the door, which didn't work. Now, they have the key. So the next action should be to use the key to unlock the door. The correct command would be "unlock wooden door" again, but maybe the game requires "use key on wooden door" or similar. However, in the previous steps, the user was told to "unlock the wooden door" and that didn't work. So maybe the key is needed. Therefore, the next action is to use the key on the door. But the user's previous action was "unlock wooden door", which didn't work. So perhaps the correct next step is to use the key. But the game's commands might be case-sensitive or require specific phrasing. Since the user's last action was "unlock wooden door", which failed, the next step is to try using the key. Therefore, the next command should be "use key on wooden door" or "unlock wooden door with key". But the game might accept "unlock wooden door" again, but since it's fixed, maybe the key is required. Alternatively, maybe the door is locked, and the key is needed to unlock it. So the correct action is to use the key on the door. But the user has the key from the chest drawer. So the next action is to unlock the door with the key. Therefore, the answer should be "unlock wooden door" again, but perhaps the game expects that. However, in the previous step, the user tried to unlock the door and it didn't work. So maybe the key is needed. Therefore, the next action is to use the key to unlock the door. But the game's possible commands might be "unlock wooden door" or "use key on door". Since the user's previous action was "unlock wooden door", which didn't work, the next step is to try using the key. But the user hasn't used the key yet. So the correct next action is to use the key on the door. Therefore, the answer is "use key on wooden door".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to unlock the wooden door using the key they found. Earlier, they tried "unlock wooden door" twice, but the door was fixed. Then they tried "use key on wooden door", which didn't work.

Hmm, maybe the correct command is "unlock door" instead of "unlock wooden door"? Or perhaps "open door"? Wait, the key is for the door, so maybe "use key on door" is the right syntax. But the game didn't recognize "use key on wooden door". Maybe the door is just called "door" instead of "wooden door" in the commands. Let me check the previous messages.

In the bedroom description, the door is mentioned as "closed wooden door leading east". So the game might refer to it as "door" or "wooden door". The user tried "unlock wooden door" and it didn't work. Maybe the correct command is "unlock door". Alternatively, since the key is an object, maybe "open door with key" or "use key to unlock door".

Wait, the game might expect "unlock door" without specifying "wooden". Let me think. The user's last attempt was "use key on wooden door", which failed. Maybe the correct command is "unlock door" or "open door". Alternatively, "use key on door". Let me try "unlock door" next.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to unlock the wooden door. They have an old key from the chest drawer. The previous attempt was to use the key on the door, but the system didn't recognize "use key on wooden door" as a valid command. Then they tried "unlock door", but the system asked what they want to unlock it with.

So, the correct action here is to use the key to unlock the door. The key is already in the player's inventory since they retrieved it from the chest drawer. The command should be "unlock wooden door with key". But since the system might expect a different syntax, maybe "unlock door with key" is the right way. However, in the previous attempt, "unlock door" was given, and the system asked for the key. So the next step is to specify using the key. The correct command is probably "unlock wooden door with key". But the user has to make sure the command is in the right format. The system might require "use key on wooden door" but that was previously invalid. Alternatively, "unlock door with key". Let me check the previous interactions. The user tried "use key on wooden door" which was invalid. Then "unlock door" which led to being asked to use what. So the correct command is "unlock door with key". But the user has to make sure that's the right syntax. So the next action is "unlock door with key".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to unlock the wooden door with the old key. The previous attempt was "unlock door with key", but the system said they need to take the key first. So the key is in the chest drawer, which they already opened. Wait, the chest drawer was opened earlier, and the old key was recovered from there. So the key is already in the player's inventory, right? So the next step should be to use the key on the door. But the system might be expecting a specific command format.

Wait, the user tried "unlock door with key" and got an error. The system said they need to take the key first. But the key was already taken when they opened the chest drawer. Maybe the command should be "use key on door" or "unlock door with key" but the system is strict. Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "unlock door" and the key is already in hand. But the system might require specifying the key. Let me check the previous steps again.

The user first opened the chest drawer, found the key. Then tried to unlock the door, but the door was fixed. Then tried "unlock door with key", but the system said the key wasn't taken. Wait, maybe the key wasn't picked up yet. Oh, right! When you open the chest drawer, you see the key, but you have to pick it up. So the user might have just opened the drawer but not taken the key. So the next step is to take the key first. Then use it to unlock the door.

Wait, the initial instruction said "recover the old key from the chest drawer within the bedroom." So the user needs to take the key from the chest drawer. But in the previous step, the user opened the chest drawer and saw the key. But maybe they didn't pick it up yet. So the correct action is to take the key first. Then unlock the door with it. So the next command should be "take old key" or "take key". Then "unlock door" or "unlock wooden door with key". But the system might require specific verbs. Let me think about the possible commands.

The user tried "unlock door with key" and got an error. The system said they need to take the key first. So the key is in the chest drawer, but the user hasn't taken it. So the correct next step is to take the key. Then, after taking it, unlock the door. So the next action should be "take old key" or "take key". But the system might have specific names. The key is called "old key" in the chest drawer. So the user needs to take that. Then, after taking it, use it to unlock the door. So the next command is "take old key".

The previous attempt to unlock the door failed because they didn't have the key with them. Now, after taking the key, the next logical step would be to use the key to unlock the door.

But in the game's context, the command might need to be phrased as "unlock door with key" or "use key on door". However, the system might expect a specific command structure. Since the user previously tried "unlock door" and was prompted to specify the key, the correct action now is to use the key on the door. So the next command should be "unlock door with key" to proceed.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps in the TextWorld game. They started by opening the chest drawer, finding the old key, then trying to unlock the wooden door. They had some issues with the commands, like "unlock door" without specifying the key, but then they figured out to use the key.

Now, after successfully unlocking the door, the next step according to the original task was to "open the wooden door." Since they've already unlocked it, the next logical step would be to open it. But in the game's context, sometimes unlocking and opening might be separate actions. However, since the door was previously closed and they've just unlocked it, maybe the next step is to open it. Alternatively, they might need to go through the door to the east as mentioned in the initial task.

Looking at the previous steps, after unlocking the door, the user is in the bedroom. The next action should be to go east through the door. The user's last action was unlocking the door, so the next command should be "go east" to move into the next room. But the user's last input was "unlock door with key," which worked. Now, the next step is to open the door, but since it's already unlocked, maybe they need to push it open or just go through. However, in TextWorld, sometimes you have to use "open" after unlocking. But the initial instruction said "unlock the wooden door. Then, open the wooden door." So after unlocking, they need to open it. But the user might have already done that. Wait, the user just unlocked it, so maybe the next step is to open it. But in the game's response after unlocking, the door is fixed in place, so maybe they need to open it. Alternatively, the user might need to go through the door. Let me check the original task again.

Original task: After unlocking and opening the door, attempt to go to the east. So after opening the door, go east. But the user is in the bedroom, and the door leads east. So after opening the door, they can go east. But the user hasn't opened the door yet. So the next step is to open the door. However, in the game, after unlocking, maybe the door is now open. But the user's previous action was unlocking, and the game's response was "You unlock wooden door." So maybe the door is now open. Then the next step is to go east. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action should be "go east." But the user's last action was unlocking the door, so the next step is to go east. However, the user might need to open the door first. But in the game, after unlocking, the door might be open. So the correct next step is to go east. Therefore, the answer should be "go east."

Since the user is in the bedroom, and the door leads east, the command should be "open door" or specify the wooden door. Let me check the previous interactions. The user tried "unlock door with key" which worked, but the door is still closed. Wait, maybe "unlock" and "open" are different actions. The door is unlocked but needs to be opened.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps in the TextWorld game. They started by opening the chest drawer, finding the old key, then trying to unlock the wooden door. There was a bit of back-and-forth because the door was locked, but they eventually used the key to unlock it and opened the door. Now they're in a new location, probably the east room beyond the door.

The next step according to the original task was to make sure the refrigerator in the kitchen is ajar. But the user hasn't mentioned a kitchen yet. Wait, maybe after going east, they enter a kitchen area. The next action would be to check the refrigerator. But the user's last action was opening the wooden door, so the next logical step is to move to the kitchen. However, the user's previous action was "go east", which might have led them to the kitchen. But the game's response says they need to check the refrigerator. So maybe after going east, they need to go to the kitchen and check the fridge. But the user hasn't done that yet. The current location might be the kitchen, so the next step is to check if the refrigerator is open. If it's not, they need to open it. Then pick up the milk. But the user's last action was opening the door, so the next step is to go to the kitchen. Wait, but the user's last action was "go east", which might have already moved them to the kitchen.

The next step is to check the refrigerator. So the correct action would be to look at the refrigerator or open it if it's closed. But the task says to make sure it's ajar. So the user needs to open it if it's closed. The next action should be "open refrigerator" or "open kitchen refrigerator". But the game might have specific verbs. The user's previous actions were "go east", so maybe the next step is to check the fridge. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action is to go to the kitchen, but they might already be there. The user's last action was "go east", which probably moved them to the kitchen. So now, the next step is to check the refrigerator. The correct command would be "open refrigerator" or "open fridge". But the game might use "open" as the verb.

-= Bedroom =-
You've entered a bedroom. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

You make out a chest drawer. The chest drawer is empty, what a horrible day! You see a closed antique trunk. You can see a king-size bed. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. This always happens, here in TextWorld!

There is an open wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the bedroom, and they've already opened the chest drawer and took the old key. They unlocked and opened the wooden door, went east, but now they need to check the refrigerator in the kitchen. However, when they tried to open the refrigerator, it wasn't there. So they looked around again and found that the refrigerator isn't in the bedroom.

Wait, the original task said to first check the chest drawer, get the key, unlock the door, open it, then go east. Then make sure the refrigerator in the kitchen is ajar and pick up milk. But now, after going east, the user is in a new location. Wait, the previous step was opening the wooden door east, so maybe they are now in the kitchen? But when they tried to open the refrigerator, it wasn't there. Maybe the kitchen is the next room. Let me check the previous messages.

After opening the wooden door east, the user tried to open the refrigerator but couldn't see it. Then they looked again and saw the bedroom again. Wait, maybe the user is still in the bedroom? Or maybe after opening the door, they went east into another room, but the refrigerator is in the kitchen, which is a different location. The user needs to navigate to the kitchen. But the current location is the bedroom, as per the last description. So the user needs to go to the kitchen. But how?

Wait, the initial task said after opening the wooden door, go east. Then check the refrigerator in the kitchen. So perhaps after opening the door, the user is in the kitchen. But when they tried to open the refrigerator, it wasn't there. Maybe the user is in the kitchen but the refrigerator is closed or not visible. Or maybe the user needs to look for the kitchen. Alternatively, maybe the user is still in the bedroom, and the kitchen is another room. But the user has to go east from the bedroom to reach the kitchen. So the next step is to go east again, but the user is already in the kitchen? Or maybe the user is in the bedroom, and the kitchen is a different room. The user needs to find the kitchen and then open the refrigerator.

But in the last message, after opening the door, the user tried to open the refrigerator but couldn't see it. Then they looked again and the description says the bedroom again. Maybe the user is still in the bedroom, and the kitchen is not yet accessed. So the user needs to go east again to reach the kitchen. Wait, but the wooden door was opened, leading east. So perhaps the user is in the kitchen now. But the refrigerator isn't there. Maybe the user needs to look for the refrigerator in the kitchen. Alternatively, maybe the user is in the bedroom, and the kitchen is another room. The user needs to go east again to reach the kitchen. But the user is already in the bedroom. Wait, the user opened the wooden door east, so they must have moved to the east room, which is the kitchen. But when they tried to open the refrigerator, it wasn't there. So maybe the user is in the kitchen, but the refrigerator is closed. The user needs to open it. But the user tried to open it and it wasn't there. So maybe the user needs to look again. But the user just looked and the description says the bedroom again. That's confusing. Maybe the user is still in the bedroom, and the kitchen is not yet accessible. Or maybe the user made a mistake in navigating. The user needs to go to the kitchen, find the refrigerator, open it, and take the milk. So the next step is to go east again to reach the kitchen. But the user is already in the kitchen? Or maybe the user is in the bedroom, and the kitchen is a different room. The user needs to go east again. But the previous action was opening the wooden door east, which led to the kitchen. So the user is in the kitchen now. But when they tried to open the refrigerator, it wasn't there. So maybe the user needs to look for the refrigerator in the kitchen. Alternatively, maybe the user is in the bedroom, and the kitchen is not yet accessed. The user needs to go east again. But the user is already in the kitchen. This is a bit confusing. The user's next action should be to go to the kitchen, find the refrigerator, open it, and take the milk. So the next command is to go east again, but the user is already in the kitchen. Alternatively, maybe the user is in the bedroom, and the kitchen is a different room. The user needs to go east again. But the user is already in the kitchen. Maybe the user is in the kitchen, but the refrigerator is closed. So the user needs to open it. But the user tried to open it and it wasn't there. So maybe the user needs to look again. But the user just looked and the description says the bedroom again. This is confusing. The user needs to proceed to the kitchen, find the refrigerator, open it, and take the milk. The next action is to go to the kitchen, which is east. So the user should go east again.

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place. The room is well lit.

Oh, great. Here's a refrigerator. You make out a counter. The counter is ordinary. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. You see a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You can see a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island. Huh, weird.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

Okay, let me figure out what to do next. The user's goal is to recover the old key from the bedroom chest drawer, unlock the wooden door, open it, go east, check the refrigerator, pick up milk, and put it on the stove.

So far, the user has opened the chest drawer in the bedroom, taken the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, and gone east into the kitchen. The current location is the kitchen. The next step according to the original plan was to make sure the refrigerator is ajar. But when the user tried to open the refrigerator, they got an error saying it wasn't visible. Then they looked around and saw the refrigerator is there, but it's closed. Wait, the user just entered the kitchen, and the refrigerator is described as closed. So the next action should be to open the refrigerator.

But the user's last action was "go east", which led them to the kitchen. Now, in the kitchen, the refrigerator is closed. The user needs to open it. The next step is to open the refrigerator. Then, after opening it, they can check if there's milk inside to pick up. So the correct command here is "open refrigerator".

Okay, let's see. The user's goal is to follow a series of steps to complete the game. So far, they've opened the chest drawer, retrieved the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, moved east to the kitchen, and opened the refrigerator. Now, the next step according to the original task was to pick up the milk from the refrigerator. The user just opened the refrigerator and found milk and lettuce. So the next logical action is to take the milk.

But wait, the game might require specific commands. The user has to pick up the milk, so the correct command would be "take milk". Let me check the previous interactions. The user said "open refrigerator" and the game responded with the items inside. Now, the next step is to take the milk. So the answer should be "take milk".

Okay, let me see. The user has to pick up the milk and put it on the stove. They just took the milk from the refrigerator. The next step should be to go to the stove. But wait, the current location is the kitchen. The user needs to sit the milk on the stove. So the action would be to put the milk on the stove. But the correct command here is "put milk on stove". Let me check the previous steps. The user was in the kitchen, opened the refrigerator, took the milk. Now they need to go to the stove. Wait, maybe they need to go to the stove first. But the stove is in the kitchen. So the user is already in the kitchen. So the next action is to put the milk on the stove. But the system might require the exact command. Let me check the previous interactions. The user said "put milk on stove" after taking the milk. Wait, in the history, after taking the milk, the user's next action was "put milk on stove". But the assistant's response was "You put the milk on the stove." So the correct command is "put milk on stove". But the user hasn't done that yet. The last action was taking the milk, so the next action should be putting it on the stove. So the answer is "put milk on stove".
