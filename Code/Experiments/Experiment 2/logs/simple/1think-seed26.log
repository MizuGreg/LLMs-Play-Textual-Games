I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First off, open the antique trunk. After that, take the old key from the antique trunk inside the bedroom. Once you have picked up the old key, make it so that the wooden door is unlocked. After unlocking the wooden door, assure that the wooden door is opened. And then, make an attempt to go to the east. After that, look and see that the refrigerator is opened. After that, recover the lettuce from the refrigerator. If you can get your hands on the lettuce, put the lettuce on the stove. Got that? Good!

-= Bedroom =-
You arrive in a bedroom. A typical one.

You can make out a closed chest drawer. You scan the room for an antique trunk, and you find an antique trunk. You check the price tag that's still affixed to the antique trunk. Eighty bucks?! That's ridiculous! Do you know my good friend, they work for the government? I'm sure my friend could get you one of those for 45 bucks! You can see a king-size bed. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me see. The user has already opened the antique trunk and found the old key. The next step according to the task was to take the old key from the trunk. So, after opening the trunk, the immediate next action should be to take the key. The user's score increased by one, so they're on the right track.

Looking at the current room description, the wooden door leading east is closed. The next steps after taking the key are to unlock the door. But wait, the task says to unlock the wooden door first, then open it. So after taking the key, the user needs to use it to unlock the door. But how? Maybe the key is for the door. So after taking the key, the user should try to unlock the door with the key. Then, once unlocked, open the door. Then go east. Then check the refrigerator, open it, get the lettuce, put it on the stove.

But the current prompt is asking for the next action. The user has just opened the trunk and got the key. So the next step is to take the key. The user's last action was opening the trunk, so the next command should be "take old key". Then, after taking it, they need to unlock the door. But the door is closed, so maybe the key is needed to unlock it. So the next action after taking the key is to unlock the door. But the user hasn't done that yet. Wait, the task says: "make it so that the wooden door is unlocked. After unlocking the wooden door, assure that the wooden door is opened." So first unlock, then open. So after taking the key, the user should use it to unlock the door. So the next action is "take old key" from the trunk. Then, use the key to unlock the door. But the current state is that the user has the key. So the next step is to unlock the door. But how? The user needs to use the key on the door. So the command would be "unlock wooden door with old key". But maybe the game expects "unlock wooden door" and the key is in the inventory. Alternatively, maybe the key is needed to unlock the door, so after taking the key, the user can unlock the door. So the next action is to take the key, then unlock the door. But the user just took the key, so the next step is to unlock the door. Wait, the user's last action was opening the trunk, which gave them the key. Now, they need to take the key. So the next command is "take old key". Then, after that, they can unlock the door. But the user's next action is to take the key. So the answer should be "take old key".

Okay, the user has taken the old key from the trunk. The next step according to the task is to unlock the wooden door. So now that they have the key, they need to use it to unlock the door. The door is closed, so the action would be to unlock it. The command should be "unlock wooden door". But wait, in some text adventures, you might need to specify using the key. But since the key is in their inventory, maybe just unlocking the door is enough. Let me check the previous steps. The user opened the trunk, took the key. Now, the next step is to unlock the door. So the correct command is "unlock wooden door". Then, after unlocking, they need to open it. So the next action is to unlock the door.

The command would be "open wooden door". Let me check the previous actions. They unlocked the door, so now they need to open it. Then, after opening, they have to go east. So the next action is to open the door.

But wait, maybe the door is already open after unlocking? No, the task says first unlock, then open. So even though it's unlocked, they need to open it. So the command is "open wooden door".

But wait, the current room is the bedroom, and the door leads east. So after opening the door, they can go through it. The command is "go east". That's the next step.

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a typical kind of place. That is to say, you're in a kitchen.

If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a refrigerator. You can make out a counter. The counter is standard. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. This always happens, here in TextWorld! What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. Look over there! a kitchen island. On the kitchen island you can see a note. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

Okay, the user is in the kitchen now. The next step according to the task is to look at the refrigerator, open it, recover the lettuce, and put it on the stove. So first, they need to look at the refrigerator. The command would be "look refrigerator" or "examine refrigerator". But in some games, you might need to open it first. Wait, the task says "look and see that the refrigerator is opened". So maybe the refrigerator is closed, and they need to open it. But the user is in the kitchen, and the refrigerator is mentioned as being there. Let me check the current description. The refrigerator is described as "closed", so the user needs to open it. So the next action is to open the refrigerator. But the task says "look and see that the refrigerator is opened". Wait, maybe the user needs to open it first. So the correct step is to open the refrigerator. Then, after opening, take the lettuce. So the next command is "open refrigerator".
