I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is how to play! First stop, open the chest drawer. After that, recover the old key from the chest drawer within the bedroom. Then, check that the wooden door is unlocked with the old key. And then, open the wooden door inside the bedroom. Then, go to the east. And then, look and see that the screen door in the kitchen is ajar. After that, make an effort to venture east. And then, attempt to move south. With that accomplished, lift the bell pepper from the floor of the garden. After that, move north. Okay, and then, attempt to take a trip west. Following that, rest the bell pepper on the stove. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Bedroom =-
You've fallen into an usual room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be usual. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the bedroom.

You can see a closed chest drawer. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just an antique trunk. Hmm. You always thought you'd be more excited to see an antique trunk in a room. You can make out a king-size bed. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

<think>
Okay, let me see. The user is in a text-based game where they need to follow a series of steps to win. So far, they've opened the chest drawer in the bedroom and found an old key. The next step according to the initial instructions was to recover the old key from the chest drawer within the bedroom. Wait, but they just did that. Now they need to check if the wooden door is unlocked with the key.

Wait, the user's current location is the bedroom. The chest drawer is closed, but they opened it and got the key. Now, the next step in the original plan was to check that the wooden door is unlocked with the old key. So the next action should be to use the key on the wooden door. But how is that phrased in the game's commands?

Looking at the previous steps, after opening the chest drawer, the user found the key. Now, the wooden door leading east is closed. So the next step is to unlock it with the key. The command would be "unlock the wooden door with the old key" or something similar. But in the game's context, maybe it's "use the old key on the wooden door" or "unlock the wooden door". The exact phrasing depends on the game's accepted commands.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "check that the wooden door is unlocked with the old key", but the game might require an action like "unlock" or "use key". Since the user has the key, they need to use it on the door. So the next action should be to unlock the wooden door with the old key. But the user has to input the command as per the game's syntax. The previous action was "open the chest drawer", so the next logical step is to use the key on the door. Therefore, the correct command is "unlock the wooden door with the old key".

Okay, let me figure this out. The user tried to unlock the wooden door with the old key, but the game said they need to take the old key first. Wait, but they already recovered the key from the chest drawer. Oh, maybe the key is still in the chest drawer, so they need to pick it up first. The previous step was opening the chest drawer, which revealed the old key. But maybe the key is not in their inventory yet. So the correct action would be to take the old key from the chest drawer. Then, after taking it, they can try unlocking the door. So the next command should be "take the old key".

GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

You take the old key from the chest drawer.

Okay, let's see. The user has taken the old key from the chest drawer. Now, the next step according to the original plan was to check that the wooden door is unlocked with the old key. So now that they have the key, they need to use it on the door. The command would be to unlock the wooden door with the old key. But in the game's context, maybe it's just "unlock the wooden door" since the key is already in hand. Wait, the previous attempt was to unlock the door directly, but the game said they needed to take the key first. Now that they have the key, the next action should be to unlock the door. So the correct command is "unlock the wooden door".

Okay, let me recap. The user has successfully unlocked the wooden door leading east. The next step in the original plan was to "open the wooden door inside the bedroom." Wait, but the door was already unlocked. Maybe the next action is to open it. But since it's a door, maybe the command is just "open the wooden door." Alternatively, after unlocking, they need to push or pull it open. But the game might accept "open the wooden door" as the command. So the next action should be to open the door.

Wait, the user is in the bedroom, and the wooden door leading east is now unlocked. So the next step is to open it. The command would be "open the wooden door east" or just "open the wooden door." Since the door is unlocked, opening it should be possible. The game's previous steps indicate that after unlocking, the next action is to open it. So the correct command is "open the wooden door".

Okay, the user has opened the wooden door leading east. The next step according to the original plan was to "go to the east." So after opening the door, they need to move east. The command would be "go east." Let me check the previous steps. The user was told to "go east" after opening the door. So the next action is to go east. The game's environment probably allows movement in directions once the door is open. So the correct command is "go east".

You are in a kitchen. A standard kind of place. Let's see what's in here.

You make out a closed refrigerator nearby. You can see a counter. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The counter is normal. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a stove. But the thing is empty. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is usual. On the kitchen island you can see a note. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

However, the game might require them to open it. Alternatively, the user might need to check the screen door's status.
