Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, you could, like, look and see that the antique trunk inside the bedroom is opened. Then, recover the old key from the antique trunk. Then, make absolutely sure that the wooden door inside the bedroom is unlocked. After unlocking the wooden door, open the wooden door in the bedroom. Then, try to head east. After that, try to travel south. Once you get through with that, take the milk from the couch within the living room. Having taken the milk, attempt to travel north. That done, rest the milk on the stove inside the kitchen. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Bedroom =-
You make a grand eccentric entrance into a bedroom.

You see a closed normal looking chest drawer right there by you. You can see an antique trunk. You see a king-size bed. But the thing is empty.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they need to follow a series of steps to win. So far, they've looked at the antique trunk, which is closed. The goal is to open it, get the key, unlock the door, open the door, go east, south, get milk from the couch in the living room, then go north, rest the milk on the stove in the kitchen, and win.

The current location is the bedroom. The user has already looked at the antique trunk, but it's closed. The next step according to the initial instructions was to recover the old key from the trunk. But since the trunk is closed, they need to open it first. The user might not know how to open it yet. So the next logical step would be to try opening the trunk. But in the game's context, maybe the trunk can be opened by using the key, but the key is inside. Wait, but the user hasn't found the key yet. So maybe the trunk is locked, and the key is inside. But how to open it?

Wait, the user's first action was to look at the antique trunk. The game's response says the trunk is closed, and the lid is in the way. So the user needs to open it. But how? Maybe the user needs to use the key, but the key is inside the trunk. That seems circular. Alternatively, maybe the trunk has a lock that can be picked, but the user doesn't have a tool for that. Or perhaps the trunk can be opened by some other means, like using a specific action.

Wait, the initial instructions said to "recover the old key from the antique trunk." So maybe the key is inside the trunk, but the trunk is closed. So the user needs to open the trunk first. But how? Maybe the user needs to find a way to open it. Since the user is in the bedroom, maybe there's a way to open the trunk. The user might need to try opening it, even though it's closed. But in the game's context, maybe the action is "open antique trunk" or "open trunk."

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to find a key first, but that's the goal. So perhaps the user needs to find a way to open the trunk. Since the user is in the bedroom, maybe the next step is to try opening the trunk. The user's next action should be to attempt to open the trunk. Let me check the previous steps again.

The user's first action was "look at antique trunk," which was closed. The game's response says the trunk is closed, lid in the way. So the next step would be to try opening it. So the correct action here is to try opening the trunk. The user hasn't done that yet. So the next command should be "open antique trunk" or "open trunk." The game's environment might have that as a possible action. So the user's next action should be to open the trunk to retrieve the key inside.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps to solve the text adventure game. They started by looking at the antique trunk, opened it, and found an old key. Now they need to make sure the wooden door in the bedroom is unlocked. The next step after getting the key would be to use it to unlock the door.

Wait, the current location is the bedroom. The user has the key, so they should go to the wooden door and unlock it. The previous steps were correct: opening the trunk, getting the key. Now, the next logical step is to unlock the door. The user needs to go to the door, then use the key. But in the game, the action might be "unlock wooden door" or "use key on door". But the user's previous action was "open antique trunk", so maybe the next step is to unlock the door. Let me check the game's possible commands. Since the door is closed, they need to unlock it. The key is in their inventory now. So the next action should be to unlock the door. But the game might require them to first go to the door. Wait, the user is already in the bedroom, and the door is leading east. So maybe the next step is to unlock the door. But the game might require the user to first approach the door. However, the user's previous action was opening the trunk, so the next step is to unlock the door. The user's next action should be "unlock wooden door". But the game might have specific commands. Alternatively, maybe they need to use the key on the door. But the user hasn't used the key yet. So the correct action is to unlock the door with the key. But the game's interface might require the user to first go to the door. However, the user is already in the bedroom, and the door is there. So the next step is to unlock the door. The user's next action should be "unlock wooden door".

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps to solve the text adventure game. So far, they've looked at the antique trunk, opened it to get an old key, and then tried to unlock the wooden door. The door was fixed, so maybe they need to use the key to unlock it.

Wait, the next step after unlocking the door was to open it. But the user tried to unlock it and the door was fixed. Maybe "unlock" is the correct action here. But the door is closed, so perhaps they need to use the key to unlock it. Let me check the previous steps again.

The user was told to "make absolutely sure that the wooden door inside the bedroom is unlocked. After unlocking the wooden door, open the wooden door in the bedroom." So first, unlock it, then open it. But when they tried to unlock, the door was fixed. Maybe "unlock" is the right action here. The key is in the trunk, so using the key to unlock the door would make sense. So the next step should be to use the key on the door. But the game might require a specific command like "use key on door" or "unlock door with key". However, the user's previous actions were "unlock wooden door", which might not have worked yet. So maybe the correct next step is to try unlocking the door again, or perhaps use the key. But the user has the key now, so they need to use it. The game might accept "use key on door" or "unlock door". But the user's previous action was "unlock wooden door", which might not have worked. So maybe the correct next step is to try unlocking the door again, or perhaps use the key. The user needs to use the key to unlock the door. So the next action should be "use key on wooden door" or "unlock wooden door with key". But the game's commands might be more straightforward. Let me check the previous responses. The user tried "unlock wooden door" and the door was fixed. So maybe the correct action is to use the key to unlock it. Therefore, the next command should be "use key on wooden door".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to solve this text-based game. So far, they've opened the antique trunk and found an old key. Then they tried to unlock the wooden door, but the door is fixed. They tried using the key on the door, but that wasn't a valid action.

Hmm, the error message says "That's not a verb I recognise." So the previous action "use key on wooden door" wasn't correct. Maybe the correct action is to "unlock" the door with the key? But the user already tried "unlock wooden door" which didn't work. Wait, maybe the key is needed to unlock the door, but the game expects a different command.

Alternatively, maybe the key is for a different lock. Let me think about the game's logic. The user needs to unlock the wooden door in the bedroom. Since they have the key, perhaps the correct action is to "use key on door" or "unlock door with key". But the game might have specific verbs. The previous attempt was "use key on wooden door", which didn't work. Maybe the correct command is "unlock door" or "open door with key".

Wait, the user is in the bedroom, and the wooden door is closed. The key is from the trunk. So the correct action would be to use the key to unlock the door. But the game might require the exact phrase. Maybe "unlock wooden door" is the correct command, but the user tried that before. Wait, the user tried "unlock wooden door" and the door was fixed. Then they tried "use key on wooden door", which was invalid. So maybe the correct action is "unlock door" without specifying the wooden door, but the game might require the exact name.

Alternatively, maybe the key is for a different lock. Wait, the user has the key, so they need to use it on the door. The correct command might be "use key on door" or "unlock door with key". But the game might have specific verbs. Let me check the previous steps again.

The user's last action was "use key on wooden door", which was invalid. The error says it's not a recognized verb. So maybe the correct action is "unlock door" or "open door". But the door is fixed, so maybe the key is needed. Alternatively, the key is for a different lock, like the chest. But the chest was already opened. Hmm.

Wait, the user's goal is to unlock the wooden door in the bedroom. The key is from the trunk. So the correct action is to use the key to unlock the door. The game might expect the command "unlock door" or "use key on door". Since "use key on wooden door" was invalid, maybe the correct command is "unlock door" or "open door with key". But the game might require the exact phrase. Alternatively, maybe the key is already in the inventory, and the user needs to "unlock wooden door" with the key. But the previous attempt didn't work. Maybe the correct command is "unlock door" without specifying the key. But the door is fixed, so maybe the key is needed. Alternatively, the user might need to "open door" after unlocking it.

Wait, the user's next action should be to unlock the door with the key. Since "use key on wooden door" didn't work, maybe the correct command is "unlock wooden door" again, but that didn't work before. Or maybe "open wooden door" with the key. But the game might have specific verbs. Alternatively, the user might need to "use key on door" instead of "wooden door". Let me think. The game might accept "use key on door" as the correct command. So the next action should be "use key on door".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to solve this text adventure game. They've already opened the antique trunk and found an old key. Then they tried to unlock the wooden door, but the system didn't recognize "unlock" as a verb. They tried "use key on wooden door" and "use key on door", but both were rejected.

Hmm, maybe the correct command is to "use the key on the door" but with the right phrasing. Wait, in text adventures, sometimes you have to specify the object properly. Like "use key on door" might not be correct. Maybe it's "unlock door with key" or "open door with key". But the user tried "use key on door" and it didn't work. Alternatively, maybe the door is locked, and the key is needed to unlock it. The system might expect a different verb, like "unlock" followed by the door and the key. But the user tried "unlock wooden door" and it didn't work. Wait, the initial message said the door is closed. Wait, the user's previous action was "unlock wooden door", but the system said the door is fixed. Wait, maybe the door is locked, and the key is needed to unlock it. But the user hasn't used the key yet. So perhaps the correct command is to "use key on door" but the system is expecting a different phrasing. Alternatively, maybe the key is in the trunk, and the user needs to take it first. Wait, the user already took the key from the trunk. So the next step is to use the key on the door. But the system is not accepting "use key on door". Maybe the correct command is "open door with key" or "unlock door with key". But the user tried "use key on door" and it didn't work. Alternatively, maybe the door is locked, and the correct verb is "unlock", but the user needs to specify the key. Wait, the system might require "unlock door with key" but the user tried "unlock wooden door" without the key. So maybe the correct command is "unlock door with key". But the user hasn't used the key yet. Wait, the user has the key, so maybe the correct command is "unlock door with key". Let me check the previous steps again. The user opened the trunk, got the key, then tried to unlock the door. The system said the door is fixed. Then the user tried "use key on wooden door" and "use key on door", both rejected. So maybe the correct command is "unlock door with key". But the system might not accept that. Alternatively, maybe the key is already in hand, so the command is "use key on door". But the system is not recognizing it. Maybe the correct verb is "open" instead of "unlock". Wait, the door is closed, so maybe "open door" is the command, but the door is locked. So the key is needed. So perhaps the correct command is "open door with key". But the system might not accept that. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "unlock" the door first, then "open" it. But the user tried "unlock wooden door" and it didn't work. Maybe the correct command is "unlock door" and the key is automatically used. But the system is not accepting that. This is confusing. Maybe the user needs to "use key on door" again, but the system is rejecting it. Alternatively, maybe the key is not in the inventory. Wait, the user took the key from the trunk, so it should be in hand. Maybe the correct command is "open door" but the door is locked. So the user needs to use the key to unlock it. But the system is not accepting "use key on door". Maybe the correct command is "unlock door" and the key is used automatically. But the user tried that and it didn't work. Hmm. Maybe the system expects "use key to unlock door". But the user tried "use key on door" and it didn't work. Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "unlock door with key". But the system is not recognizing that. I think the user is stuck here. The next step should be to try "unlock door with key" even though it's not recognized.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to solve this text-based game. So far, they've opened the antique trunk and found an old key. Then they tried to unlock the wooden door, but the system kept saying that wasn't the right action. Then they tried using the key on the door, but that didn't work either. Now, the error message says they need to take the old key first.

Wait, maybe the key is still in the trunk. The user just opened the trunk and took the key, right? Let me check the previous steps. The user opened the trunk, found the key, and the score increased. So the key is in their inventory. But maybe they didn't pick it up yet. Oh, right, in some games, you have to pick up items before using them. So the next step should be to take the key from the trunk. But wait, the trunk was already opened. So maybe the key is inside the trunk. So the user needs to take the key first, then use it on the door.

But in the previous interaction, the user tried to use the key on the door without taking it. So the system is saying they need to take the key first. So the correct action here is to take the key from the trunk. But the trunk is already open. So the command should be "take old key" or something like that. But the game might have specific verbs. Let me think. The user is in the bedroom, and the trunk is there. So the correct action is to take the key from the trunk. So the next command should be "take old key" or "take key from antique trunk". But the game might expect a specific command. Let me check the previous commands. The user said "open antique trunk" which worked. Then "use key on wooden door" which didn't work. So maybe the key is in the trunk, and the user hasn't taken it yet. So the next step is to take the key. Therefore, the correct command is "take old key" or "take key from trunk".

But they kept getting errors when trying to use the key on the door. Then, after taking the key, they tried again.

Now, the next step would be to use the key on the door. The previous attempt was "unlock door with key", which didn't work. The system said "You need to take the old key first," but the user already took it. Wait, maybe the correct command is just "use key on door" or "unlock door". But the system didn't accept "use key on door" either. Maybe the correct verb is "unlock" followed by the object. Let me check the previous interactions.

In the history, after taking the key, the user tried "unlock door with key" which was invalid. Then the system said "You need to take the old key first," but the user already took it. So maybe the correct command is "unlock door" without specifying the key, since the key is already in the inventory. Alternatively, maybe "use key on door". But the system said "That's not a verb I recognise" when the user tried "use key on door". Wait, maybe the correct command is "unlock door" directly. Let me think.

In text adventures, usually, you'd say "unlock door with key" or "use key on door". But perhaps the game expects "unlock door" if the key is in hand. Alternatively, maybe "open door" if it's locked. But the door is closed and locked. The user has the key, so the correct action is to unlock the door with the key. But the previous attempt was "unlock door with key", which was invalid. Then the user tried "use key on door", which also didn't work. Then "unlock door with key" again. The system said "You need to take the old key first," but the key was already taken. So maybe the correct command is "unlock door" without the key. Let me check the game's possible commands.

Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "use key on door". But the system said that's not a recognized verb. Wait, maybe the game uses "unlock" as the verb. So "unlock door" would be the correct command. Let me try that. The user's next action should be "unlock door".

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps to solve the text adventure game. They started by looking at the antique trunk, opening it to get the old key. Then they tried to unlock the wooden door, which was initially locked. After using the key, they successfully unlocked the door.

Now, the next step according to the original instructions was to open the wooden door in the bedroom. The user has already unlocked the door, so the next logical step would be to open it. But in the game's context, after unlocking, you usually have to push or pull it open. However, the previous action was "unlock door," which worked. Now, the next command should be to open the door. But the user might need to check if the door is now open. Alternatively, since the door was closed before unlocking, after unlocking, the next action is to open it.

Looking at the previous interaction, after unlocking, the user's next action was "open wooden door." But the system message says to only output the action. So the correct next step is to open the door. The user has already unlocked it, so opening it should be the next command.

They started by looking at the antique trunk, opening it to get the old key, then using that key to unlock and open the wooden door in the bedroom. Now, after opening the door, the next step according to the original instructions was to try to head east. 

Looking at the current state, the user is in the bedroom, having just opened the door. The next logical step would be to move east. The game's environment might have different rooms connected through doors, so moving east would take them to the next room. The user's previous actions have been successful in getting the key and opening the door, so moving east makes sense as the next action. The user hasn't encountered any obstacles here, so the command should be "go east" or "move east". Since the game might use "go" as the primary verb, "go east" is likely the correct command here. The user needs to proceed to the next room to continue fulfilling the objectives mentioned in the initial prompt.

-= Kitchen =-
Well how about that, you are in a place we're calling a kitchen. The room is well lit.

You make out a closed refrigerator nearby. You can see a counter. The counter is normal. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove. You see a kitchen island. On the kitchen island you can see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.



Your score has just gone up by one point.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Kitchen now. The goal is to take the milk from the living room, rest it on the stove in the kitchen, and then proceed. But the current room is the Kitchen, which has a stove, a refrigerator, a counter, and a note on the kitchen island. The user has already opened the wooden door from the bedroom and moved east into the kitchen.

The next step according to the original plan was to go east, then south, then north. But in the kitchen, the possible directions are east (screen door), west (open wooden door back to bedroom), north (exit), and south (which is mentioned as a possible direction). However, the user's current position is in the kitchen, and the next action might be to go south. But the kitchen's description says "You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south." So maybe going south is the next step.

But wait, the user's score is 5/9. The original plan was to go east (which they did), then south. So after entering the kitchen, the next action should be to go south. But the kitchen's description says that going south is an option. So the correct next command would be "go south". However, the user is in the kitchen, and the previous action was "go east" from the bedroom, which led to the kitchen. Now, the next step is to go south from the kitchen. But the kitchen's description mentions that going south is possible. So the next action should be "go south".

-= Living Room =-
Well I'll be, you are in the place we're calling the living room.

You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a couch. You see a milk on the couch. You see a low table. The low table is standard. On the low table you see a remote. You scan the room for a tv, and you find a tv. The tv is ordinary. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Okay, let me figure out what the next step should be. The user has been following the instructions step by step. So far, they've opened the antique trunk, taken the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door in the bedroom, then went east to the kitchen, south to the living room. Now, in the living room, they need to take the milk from the couch as per the original goal.

The current location is the Living Room. The user's next action should be to take the milk. The instruction says "take the milk from the couch within the living room." So the correct command here is "take milk." Let me make sure there's no other step needed. After taking the milk, they need to go north to the kitchen, then rest the milk on the stove. But the next immediate action is taking the milk. So the answer should be "take milk."

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps to complete the game. So far, they've opened the antique trunk, taken the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door in the bedroom, then went east to the kitchen, south to the living room, and took the milk from the couch. Now, the next step according to the original instructions was to travel north after taking the milk.

In the current scene, the user is in the Living Room. The prompt mentions there's an exit to the north. The user's last action was taking the milk, so the next logical step is to go north. The score has already increased, so the user is on the right track. They need to head north from the living room. The command should be "go north" to proceed. Let me make sure there's no other step required here. The original plan was after taking the milk, attempt to travel north, then rest the milk on the stove in the kitchen. So yes, going north from the living room is the next correct action.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps to complete the game. They started in the bedroom, opened the antique trunk, got the key, unlocked and opened the door, then went east to the kitchen. From there, they went south to the living room, took the milk, and went north back to the kitchen.

Now, the current location is the kitchen again, with a score of 7/12. The next step according to the original plan was to rest the milk on the stove in the kitchen. But the user hasn't done that yet. The game's goal includes taking the milk from the living room and then putting it on the stove in the kitchen. 

Looking at the kitchen description, there's a stove mentioned. The user has the milk, so they need to place it on the stove. The previous action was going north back to the kitchen, so the next logical step is to rest the milk on the stove. The command should be "rest milk on stove" or something similar. However, the game might use specific verbs. Since the user took the milk, they need to interact with the stove. The correct command here would be to put the milk on the stove. The exact phrasing might be "put milk on stove" or "rest milk on stove". Given the previous interactions, "rest" might not be the right verb. Maybe "put" is better. But in the game's context, "rest" could be acceptable if that's the action available. However, the user's last action was "go north", leading them back to the kitchen. Now, they need to perform the final step: placing the milk on the stove. So the next command should be "put milk on stove" or "rest milk on stove". Since the game's previous actions used "rest" when taking the milk from the couch, maybe "rest" is the correct verb here. But I need to check the previous commands. The user said "take milk" and "rest milk on stove" might be the next step. However, in the game's context, the correct command might be "put milk on stove". But the user's previous action was "go north", and the current location is the kitchen. The correct next step is to place the milk on the stove. So the answer should be "put milk on stove".
