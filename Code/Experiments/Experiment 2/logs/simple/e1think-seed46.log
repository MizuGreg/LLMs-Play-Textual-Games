Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First, it would be great if you could make sure that the antique trunk is opened. After that, pick up the old key from the antique trunk inside the bedroom. After picking up the old key, assure that the wooden door in the bedroom is unlocked. After unlocking the wooden door, doublecheck that the wooden door is wide open. Then, try to go to the east. With that accomplished, ensure that the refrigerator within the kitchen is open. And then, retrieve the milk from the refrigerator inside the kitchen. And then, rest the milk on the stove. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Bedroom =-
You are in a bedroom. A normal kind of place.

What's that over there? It looks like it's a chest drawer. You can see a closed antique trunk. You scan the room for a king-size bed, and you find a king-size bed. The king-size bed is standard. But the thing is empty.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me see. The user is in a text-based game where they need to follow a series of steps to win. So far, they've opened the antique trunk in the bedroom and found an old key. The next steps mentioned in the original instructions were to pick up the key, unlock the wooden door, make sure it's wide open, go east, open the fridge, get milk, put it on the stove, and then win.

Wait, the user just opened the trunk and got the key. Now they need to pick up the old key from the trunk. But in the current room description, the trunk is open, and the key is inside. So the next action should be to pick up the key. Let me check the previous messages again.

The user's last action was "open antique trunk", which worked. Now, the next step according to the original plan is "pick up the old key from the antique trunk inside the bedroom." So after opening the trunk, the key is inside, so the next command should be "take old key" or "pick up old key". But in the game's context, maybe the correct command is "take old key" or "get old key". However, the user might need to check if the key is in the trunk. Since the trunk is open and the key was found, the next step is to pick it up.

So the correct next action is to pick up the old key. Then, after that, they need to unlock the wooden door. But first, the key is in the trunk, so the user must take it. So the next command is "take old key".

Okay, let's see. The user has to open the antique trunk, get the key, unlock the door, make sure it's open, then go east. Then check the fridge, get milk, put it on the stove. So far, they've opened the trunk, taken the key, unlocked the door. The next step was to check if the door is wide open. But the user just said "unlock wooden door" and it worked. Now, the next step should be to verify that the door is open. So the next action should be to check if the door is open. But the game might require the player to open it explicitly. Wait, the original instructions said after unlocking, double-check that the door is wide open. So maybe the user needs to "open wooden door" again? Or maybe "check wooden door"?

The next step according to the original instructions was to try to go east. But wait, the current location is the bedroom, and the wooden door leads east. So after opening the door, the next logical step would be to go through it to the east. The user's last action was opening the wooden door, which should now allow them to move east. The next command should be "go east" to proceed to the next room, which is likely the kitchen. Then, they need to open the refrigerator and get the milk. So the next action is definitely "go east".

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. A typical kind of place.

What's that over there? It looks like it's a refrigerator. You see a counter. The counter is typical. But the thing is empty. Sometimes, just sometimes, TextWorld can just be the worst. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You see a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island. Now that's what I call TextWorld!

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an unguarded exit to the north. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

Okay, the user has to open the refrigerator in the kitchen next. Let me check the previous steps. They opened the antique trunk, took the key, unlocked and opened the bedroom door, then went east to the kitchen. Now, the goal is to open the fridge, get the milk, put it on the stove, and win.

In the kitchen, the user sees a refrigerator. The next step is to open it. The command should be "open refrigerator". That's the logical next move. Let me make sure there's no other step required. The user needs to retrieve the milk after opening it, but first, the fridge must be opened. So the correct action here is to open the refrigerator.

Okay, the user needs to retrieve the milk from the refrigerator and then rest it on the stove. So after opening the refrigerator and finding the milk, the next step is to pick up the milk. Then, they have to go to the stove and put the milk there. Let me check the previous steps again.

The user just opened the refrigerator, so the next command should be to take the milk. Once the milk is taken, they need to go to the stove. But first, they have to make sure they're at the right location. The current location is the kitchen, and the stove is mentioned as being in the kitchen. So after taking the milk, the user should go to the stove and then put the milk there. But the user's last action was opening the refrigerator, so the immediate next step is to take the milk. Then, after that, go to the stove. But the user's next input should be the command to take the milk. Let me confirm the game's state. The refrigerator is open, and the milk is inside. So the correct action is to take the milk. Then, proceed to the stove. So the next command is "take milk".

Okay, the user has to rest the milk on the stove. Let me check the current location. They're in the kitchen, and there's a stove mentioned. The previous action was taking the milk from the refrigerator. Now, the next step is to put the milk on the stove. The command should be "put milk on stove". But I need to make sure that's the correct action here. The stove is in the kitchen, and the milk is in hand. So yes, that's the right move. Let me confirm the score increment. The user's score was at 6/8, and after this action, it should go to 7/8. Then the next steps would be other actions, but according to the original plan, after resting the milk on the stove, the user wins. So this should be the next command.
