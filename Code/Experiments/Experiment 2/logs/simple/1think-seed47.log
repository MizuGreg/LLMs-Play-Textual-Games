Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is how to play! First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to ensure that the antique trunk in the bedroom is open. And then, take the old key from the antique trunk inside the bedroom. After that, unlock the wooden door inside the bedroom. After unlocking the wooden door, ensure that the wooden door inside the bedroom is open. And then, make an effort to travel east. After that, doublecheck that the screen door is open. And then, make an effort to move east. And then, go to the south. And then, recover the half of a bag of chips from the floor of the garden. After you have taken the half of a bag of chips, make an attempt to take a trip north. Following that, make an attempt to venture west. Next, place the half of a bag of chips on the stove inside the kitchen. Got that? Good!

-= Bedroom =-
You find yourself in a bedroom. An usual one. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

You can make out a closed chest drawer. You see a closed antique trunk. You can see a king-size bed. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me see. The user wants me to continue the game steps as outlined. The previous action was opening the antique trunk, which revealed an old key. Now, the next step according to the initial instructions was to take the old key from the trunk. So, after opening the trunk, the next logical step is to pick up the key.

Wait, the user's message after the trunk was opened says "You open the antique trunk, revealing an old key." So the key is now visible. The next action should be to take the key. Then, the next steps mentioned were unlocking the wooden door in the bedroom. So after taking the key, I need to unlock the door. But first, take the key. So the next command should be "take old key". Then, after that, use the key to unlock the door. But the user's instruction says after taking the key, unlock the wooden door. So the immediate next action is taking the key. Let me check the original plan again.

Original plan: Ensure the antique trunk is open (done), take the old key from the trunk (next), then unlock the wooden door. So yes, next action is take old key. Then, unlock the door. So the next command is "take old key".

Okay, so the user is playing this text-based game and has followed the steps correctly so far. Let me recap the current state. They opened the antique trunk, took the old key, and now the next step according to the initial instructions was to unlock the wooden door in the bedroom. The user's last action was taking the key, so the next logical step is to unlock the door. The command should be "unlock wooden door". I need to make sure that's the correct next action based on the given instructions. The user's score is increasing, so they're on the right track. No other actions are needed here. Just unlock the door.

Okay, let's see. The user has unlocked the wooden door in the bedroom. The next step according to the initial instructions was to ensure that the wooden door is open. Since they just unlocked it, maybe they need to check if it's open. But in the game, after unlocking, the door should automatically be open. However, the user's instruction says to "ensure that the wooden door inside the bedroom is open." So maybe the next action is to open it again? Wait, but they just unlocked it. Alternatively, maybe the next step after unlocking is to move east, as per the original plan. Let me check the original steps again.

Original steps: After unlocking the wooden door, ensure it's open. Then travel east. So after unlocking, the user needs to confirm the door is open. But in the game, once unlocked, it's probably open. However, maybe the game requires an explicit action. Alternatively, the next step after unlocking is to go east. The user's last action was unlocking the door, so the next command should be "go east". But the user's instruction says after unlocking, ensure the door is open. So maybe "open wooden door" again? But the door was just unlocked. Hmm. Wait, the user's previous action was "unlock wooden door", which probably opens it. But the instruction says to "ensure that the wooden door inside the bedroom is open". So maybe the next action is to open it again. But that might be redundant. Alternatively, maybe the game requires the player to open it explicitly. But in many text games, unlocking a door opens it. So perhaps the next step is to go east. The original plan says after unlocking, travel east. So the next command should be "go east".

Okay, the user tried to go east after unlocking the door, but the game says they have to open the wooden door first. Wait, but they just unlocked it. Maybe the door is locked again? Or maybe "open" and "unlock" are different actions here. Let me check the previous steps. The user unlocked the door, but maybe the game requires them to open it again. So the correct next step is to open the wooden door. But why would they need to open it after unlocking? Maybe in the game's context, unlocking is different from opening. So the user needs to first open the door, then it's unlocked. But that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the door is locked and needs to be opened, but the user already unlocked it. This is confusing. The game's message says "You have to open the wooden door first." So despite having unlocked it, the next action is to open it. So the correct command is "open wooden door".

The original plan after moving east from the bedroom was to double-check the screen door is open, then move east again, then go south, and recover the half bag of chips from the garden. But the current location is the kitchen. Wait, maybe the user needs to check the screen door first. The kitchen has a closed screen door leading east and an open wooden door west. The next step according to the original instructions was after moving east once, check the screen door is open. So perhaps the user needs to open the screen door. But the user's last action was "go east", which led them to the kitchen. Now, the next step is to check if the screen door is open. But the kitchen's description says the screen door is closed. So the user needs to open it. But the original instructions said after moving east, double-check the screen door is open. So the next action should be "open screen door".

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen.

You can see a refrigerator. You see a counter. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a stove. The stove is ordinary. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is usual. On the kitchen island you see a note.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

<think>
Okay, the user is back in the kitchen after going south from the bathroom. The original goal was to place the half bag of chips on the stove in the kitchen. The user has already taken the half bag of chips from the garden and is now in the kitchen. The next step is to place the chips on the stove. The kitchen has a stove, so the command should be "put half of a bag of chips on stove". Let me check the kitchen description again. The stove is ordinary but empty. So the correct action is to put the chips on it.
