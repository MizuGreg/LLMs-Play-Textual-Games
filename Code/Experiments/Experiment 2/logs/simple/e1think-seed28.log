Welcome to TextWorld! First of all, you could, like, doublecheck that the chest drawer is opened. And then, retrieve the old key from the chest drawer inside the bedroom. After that, check that the wooden door is unlocked with the old key. After that, open the wooden door. And then, travel east. Once you manage that, open the refrigerator within the kitchen. Then, recover the bell pepper from the refrigerator. If you have picked up the bell pepper, place the bell pepper on the stove inside the kitchen. Got that? Good!

-= Bedroom =-
You've just sauntered into a bedroom.

You make out a closed chest drawer nearby. You make out a closed antique trunk, which looks standard, nearby. You can make out a king-size bed. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. What's the point of an empty king-size bed?

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me see. The user is in a text-based game called TextWorld. Their goal is to follow a series of steps to reach the original goal. So far, they've opened the chest drawer in the bedroom and found an old key. The next step according to the initial instructions was to retrieve the old key from the chest drawer, which they did. Now, they need to check if the wooden door is unlocked with the old key.

Wait, the user just opened the chest drawer and got the key. The next step in the original plan was to check the wooden door with the key. So the next action should be to unlock the wooden door using the old key. But how is that done in the game? The user has to use the key on the door. So the command would be "unlock wooden door with old key" or something similar. But the game might require a specific syntax. Let me check the previous commands. The user first "open chest drawer", which worked. Then, the next step is to "check that the wooden door is unlocked with the old key". So maybe the correct command is "unlock wooden door" using the key. But the user has the key now, so they need to use it on the door. The game might accept "unlock wooden door" or "use old key on wooden door". But the user's previous action was "open chest drawer", so maybe the next step is to "unlock wooden door with old key". However, the game might require just "unlock wooden door" if the key is in hand. But the user has the key, so they can use it. The correct command here is likely "unlock wooden door". Let me make sure. The user has the old key, so they need to unlock the door. The next step in the instructions was to "check that the wooden door is unlocked with the old key. After that, open the wooden door." So the user needs to first unlock the door, then open it. So the next action is to unlock the door with the key. Therefore, the command should be "unlock wooden door with old key". But maybe the game expects "unlock wooden door" since the key is in hand. Alternatively, "use old key on wooden door". But the user's previous action was "open chest drawer", so the next logical step is to use the key to unlock the door. So the correct command is "unlock wooden door with old key".

Okay, let me figure out what to do next. The user is in the bedroom, tried to unlock the wooden door with the old key but got told they need to take the key first. So, the previous step was unlocking the door with the key, but the system said they need to take the key first. Wait, maybe the key is still in the chest drawer. The user opened the chest drawer and found the old key. Then they tried to unlock the door with it, but the game said they need to take the key first. Maybe the key isn't in their inventory yet. So the next step should be to pick up the old key from the chest drawer. Wait, but they already opened the chest drawer and the key was there. Did they take it? The initial action was opening the chest drawer, which revealed the key. Then the user tried to unlock the door with the key, but the game said they need to take the key first. So maybe the key is still in the chest drawer and hasn't been picked up yet. So the correct next step is to take the old key from the chest drawer. Then, after taking it, they can unlock the door. So the next action should be 'take old key' or 'take key from chest drawer'. But the game might have specific commands. Looking back, the user's previous action was 'unlock wooden door with old key', which was invalid because the key wasn't taken. So the correct next step is to take the key first. The chest drawer is already open, so the user needs to pick up the key from there. So the next command should be 'take old key' or 'take key from chest drawer'. The game might accept 'take old key' if it's in the inventory. But since the key was just revealed when opening the drawer, the user needs to take it. So the next action is 'take old key'.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they need to follow specific steps to reach the goal. So far, they've opened the chest drawer, found the old key, taken it, and now they're in the bedroom again.

The original goal mentioned was to open the wooden door with the old key, then go east, open the fridge, get the bell pepper, and put it on the stove. The user has already unlocked the door with the key, but maybe they need to proceed to the next area.

Wait, the previous action was taking the old key. The next logical step would be to unlock the wooden door. But the system message said "You need to take the old key first" earlier, so maybe after taking the key, the next step is to use it on the door. But the user just took the key, so now they should try to unlock the door. However, the current location is the bedroom, and the wooden door leads east. So the next action should be to unlock the door with the key. But the user might need to first be at the door's location. Since they're in the bedroom, they can try to unlock the door here. So the next command should be "unlock wooden door with old key". But the system might have already processed that. Wait, the user's last action was taking the key, so now they need to use it on the door. The correct next step is to unlock the door. Let me check the previous messages. The user tried "unlock wooden door with old key" but the system said they need to take the key first. Then they took the key, so now they can proceed to unlock the door. So the next action is to unlock the door. But the user is in the bedroom, so they can try that. So the answer should be "unlock wooden door with old key".

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps given in the initial instructions. They started by opening the chest drawer in the bedroom, retrieving the old key, unlocking the wooden door, and then opening it. Now they're in the next room, probably the kitchen since the next step mentioned was opening the refrigerator.

The next action according to the original plan was to open the refrigerator in the kitchen. Since the user has already passed the bedroom steps, the next logical step is to move to the kitchen. But wait, the user just opened the wooden door leading east, so they might have moved into the next room. The prompt now is asking for the next action, which should be moving east again or checking the kitchen. But the previous action was opening the wooden door, so the next step would be to enter that room. However, the user's score is at 4/6, so maybe the next step is to go to the kitchen. But the user hasn't mentioned the kitchen yet. Wait, the initial instructions said after opening the wooden door, travel east. So the next action should be "go east" again? Or maybe "enter wooden door"? But the game might require specific commands. Let me check the previous interactions. The user had to "open wooden door" and then the next step was to "travel east". Wait, the original instructions said after opening the wooden door, "travel east". So the next action should be "go east" or "travel east". But the user's last action was "open wooden door", so the next step is to go east. But the user is in the bedroom, and the wooden door leads east, so after opening it, they would move east into the next room, which is the kitchen. Therefore, the next command should be "go east" to move into the kitchen. Then, in the kitchen, they need to open the refrigerator. So the next action is "go east".

You find yourself in a kitchen. A standard one. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

You can make out a refrigerator. You see a counter. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a stove. The stove appears to be empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You scan the room, seeing a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Kitchen now. The original goal was to retrieve the bell pepper from the refrigerator, then place it on the stove. So far, they've opened the wooden door east, which led to the kitchen. Now, they need to open the refrigerator.

The kitchen has a refrigerator that's closed. The user's next step should be to open it. The previous actions were about unlocking the door and moving east, so now the focus is on the fridge. The user needs to interact with the refrigerator. The correct command here would be to open the refrigerator. Let me check the previous steps again to make sure. Yes, the user is in the kitchen, and the refrigerator is mentioned as closed. So the next action should be to open it. The user's score is increasing, so they're on the right track. The answer is to open the refrigerator.

Okay, let me figure out the next step here. The user has been following the instructions to open the refrigerator in the kitchen. The refrigerator had a half-bag of chips and a bell pepper. The original goal mentioned recovering the bell pepper from the refrigerator and then placing it on the stove.

So, the user needs to take the bell pepper first. Since the bell pepper is already in the refrigerator, the next logical step is to pick it up. The user's last action was opening the refrigerator, so the next command should be to take the bell pepper. That makes sense because the next step in the original plan was to retrieve the bell pepper. I need to make sure the command is correct and follows the previous actions. The user should say "take bell pepper" to pick it up. Then, after that, they can place it on the stove as per the instructions. But right now, the immediate next action is taking the bell pepper from the refrigerator.

The previous actions included opening the refrigerator and taking the bell pepper. The next logical step is to put the bell pepper on the stove. But the command needs to be in the correct format. The user has to go to the stove, but the available commands might be "go to stove" or "put bell pepper on stove". However, the game's commands might require moving to the stove first. Let me check the previous interactions. The user was told to "place the bell pepper on the stove inside the kitchen." So the correct command would be "put bell pepper on stove". But I need to make sure that the game accepts that command. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go to the stove first. But in the kitchen description, the stove is mentioned as being there. So the next action is to put the bell pepper on the stove. The user has already taken the bell pepper, so the next step is to place it on the stove.
