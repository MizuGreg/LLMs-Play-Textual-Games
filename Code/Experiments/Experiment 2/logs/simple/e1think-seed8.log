Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, doublecheck that the antique trunk in the bedroom is open. Then, pick up the old key from the antique trunk. Then, make it so that the wooden door within the bedroom is unlocked. Then, open the wooden door. After opening the wooden door, venture east. Then, open the screen door. Then, make an attempt to head east. That done, take a trip south. Then, pick up the milk from the floor of the garden. After getting the milk, try to head north. That done, attempt to take a trip west. Then, sit the milk on the stove in the kitchen. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

You find yourself in a bedroom. An usual one. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You can see a chest drawer. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's an antique trunk. Were you looking for a king-size bed? Because look over there, it's a king-size bed. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me see. The user has a list of tasks to complete in the TextWorld game. So far, they've opened the antique trunk in the bedroom and found an old key. The next steps according to the original instructions are to make the wooden door in the bedroom unlocked, then open it, venture east, open the screen door, try to go east again, then go south, pick up the milk from the garden, head north, go west, put the milk on the stove in the kitchen, and then stop.

Wait, the user just opened the trunk and got the key. Now they need to unlock the wooden door. The current location is the bedroom, and there's a closed wooden door leading east. The next action should be to unlock that door. But how? The key might be needed for that. So maybe the user needs to use the key to unlock the door. But the game's commands might require specific actions. Let me check the previous steps again.

The user's next step after getting the key is to make the wooden door unlocked. So the action would be to unlock the door. But in TextWorld, the command might be "unlock wooden door" or something similar. However, the user has to use the key. So maybe they need to use the key on the door. But the game might require the correct syntax. The previous action was "open antique trunk", which worked. So the next logical step is to unlock the door. But the door is closed, so maybe the command is "unlock wooden door". Alternatively, maybe the key is needed to unlock it, so the user has to use the key on the door. But the game might have specific commands. Let me think. The user has the key, so they need to use it to unlock the door. So the command would be "use key on wooden door" or "unlock wooden door with key". But the game's possible commands might be more straightforward. Since the user just got the key, the next step is to unlock the door. The current location is the bedroom, and the door is closed. So the correct command would be "unlock wooden door". Let me check the previous messages. The user was told to "make it so that the wooden door within the bedroom is unlocked". So the action is to unlock the door. Therefore, the next command should be "unlock wooden door".

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game where they have to follow a series of steps to complete a task. So far, they've opened the antique trunk in the bedroom and picked up the old key. Then they tried to unlock the wooden door leading east, but the door is fixed in place. Now, the next step according to the original instructions was to open the wooden door after making it unlocked. But since the door is locked, the user needs to find a way to unlock it.

Wait, the user has the old key. Maybe they need to use the key to unlock the door. But in the previous step, they tried to unlock the door, but the door was fixed. Maybe the key is needed to unlock it. So the next logical step would be to use the key on the door. Let me check the previous actions again.

The user was told to "make it so that the wooden door within the bedroom is unlocked" after picking up the key. So they need to use the key to unlock the door. The door is currently closed and fixed, so maybe using the key on it would unlock it. So the next action should be to use the key on the door. But in the game's context, the command might be "unlock wooden door" or "use key on door". However, the user's previous action was "unlock wooden door", which didn't work. Maybe the correct command is to use the key. But the game's interface might require specific commands. Since the user has the key, they need to use it on the door. So the next step is to use the key to unlock the door. Therefore, the correct command would be "use key on wooden door" or something similar. But the user's previous action was "unlock wooden door", which didn't work. So maybe the correct action is to try using the key on the door. Alternatively, maybe the door can be opened with the key. Let me think again.

The user has the key, so they need to use it to unlock the door. The door is closed and fixed, so the key is probably needed to unlock it. Therefore, the next action should be to use the key on the door. The command would be "use key on wooden door" or "unlock wooden door with key". But in the game's context, maybe the correct command is "unlock wooden door" again, but that didn't work before. Alternatively, maybe the key is in the inventory, and the user needs to use it. So the next step is to try using the key on the door. Therefore, the correct command is "use key on wooden door".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in the TextWorld game. So far, they've opened the antique trunk and picked up the old key. Then they tried to unlock the wooden door, but the system didn't recognize "unlock" as a valid command. Next, they tried "use key on wooden door", which also didn't work.

Hmm, the error message says "That's not a verb I recognise." So the game's parser isn't understanding the command. Maybe the correct verb is "unlock" instead of "use". But the user tried "unlock wooden door" earlier, and it was rejected. Wait, maybe the correct command is "unlock the wooden door" with "the" included? Or perhaps the key needs to be used in a different way.

Alternatively, maybe the key is meant to be used on the door by typing "use key on door" or something similar. But the game might expect a different phrasing. Since the user tried "use key on wooden door" and it didn't work, maybe the correct command is "open wooden door" instead? But the door is closed, so "open" might not be the right verb here.

Wait, the user's previous action was "unlock wooden door", which the game didn't recognize. Maybe the correct command is "unlock the wooden door" with "the" added. Let me check the game's possible commands. In TextWorld, sometimes you need to specify articles. So maybe "unlock the wooden door" is the correct command. Let me try that.

Then they tried to unlock the wooden door, but the system didn't recognize "unlock" as a valid verb. They tried "unlock the wooden door" again, but it still didn't work.

Hmm, maybe the correct command is just "unlock door" without specifying "wooden" since the context is already clear. Or perhaps the key needs to be used on the door. Wait, the user has the key, so maybe they need to use the key on the door to unlock it. The previous attempt was "use key on wooden door", but that was rejected. Maybe the correct syntax is "use key on door" or "unlock door with key". But the game might have specific verbs. Since the user tried "unlock" and it didn't work, maybe the correct verb is "open" instead of "unlock". But the door is locked, so "unlock" is needed. Alternatively, maybe the command is "unlock door" without any other words. Let me check the previous interactions. The user tried "unlock wooden door" and got an error. The system might expect "unlock door" or "use key on door". Since the key is in hand, perhaps "use key on door" is the right command. But the user tried "use key on wooden door" and it was rejected. Maybe the game expects "use key on door" without specifying "wooden". Alternatively, maybe the correct action is "open door" after unlocking. Wait, the user's next step after unlocking is to open the door. But the door is locked, so they need to unlock it first. The problem is that the user is getting errors for the commands. So perhaps the correct command is "unlock door" or "use key on door". Let me think again. The user has the key, so using the key on the door should unlock it. The previous attempt was "use key on wooden door", which was rejected. Maybe the game doesn't require "wooden" in the command. So the correct command would be "use key on door". Alternatively, maybe "unlock door" is the correct verb. But the system said "That's not a verb I recognise" when the user tried "unlock". So maybe the correct verb is "open" instead of "unlock". But the door is locked. Wait, the user's goal is to unlock the door. So maybe the correct action is "unlock door" but the game doesn't recognize that verb. Alternatively, the game might expect "use key on door". Let me check the possible commands. The user has the key, so using it on the door is logical. The previous attempt was "use key on wooden door", which was rejected. Maybe the game doesn't require "wooden" in that context. So the correct command is "use key on door". Alternatively, maybe "unlock door" is the correct command, but the game's parser doesn't recognize it. Since the user tried "unlock wooden door" and got an error, maybe the correct command is "unlock door". But the system said "That's not a verb I recognise" when the user tried "unlock". So perhaps the correct verb is "open" but that's for when the door is locked. Wait, no. The door is locked, so you need to unlock it. Maybe the correct command is "unlock door" but the game's parser is not recognizing it. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "use key on door". Let me try to think of possible valid commands. The user has the key, so "use key on door" is likely the correct action. The previous attempt was "use key on wooden door", which was rejected. Maybe the game doesn't require "wooden" in that case. So the correct command is "use key on door".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to unlock the wooden door in the bedroom using the key from the antique trunk. They've already opened the trunk and picked up the key. The previous attempts to unlock the door have failed because the correct verb isn't being used.

First, I need to figure out the correct action. The key is in the user's inventory, so the next step is to use the key on the door. The problem is that the user is using "unlock" instead of the correct verb. In many text adventures, the correct verb for using an object on a door is "use" or "open". But since the door is locked, maybe the correct command is "use key on door" or "open door with key".

Wait, the game might expect a specific verb. The user tried "unlock the wooden door" and "use key on wooden door", but both failed. The error messages indicate that "unlock" and "use" might not be the right verbs. Maybe the correct action is simply "open door" after using the key. Alternatively, the game might require "use key on door" without specifying "wooden".

But the user's last attempt was "use key on door", which resulted in an error. The game might not recognize "use" as the correct verb here. Maybe the correct verb is "open" or "try to open". Alternatively, the key is already in hand, so the correct action is to "open door" with the key. However, the game might require the player to first use the key on the door to unlock it before opening.

Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "unlock door with key". But the user's previous attempts didn't use that phrasing. Since the game is strict with verbs, perhaps the correct command is "open door" after using the key. But the user hasn't used the key yet. So the correct sequence is to use the key on the door to unlock it, then open the door.

But the user tried "use key on door" and got an error. Maybe the correct verb is "use key on door" but the game expects "use key on the door" with "the". Or perhaps the correct verb is "open door" after using the key. Alternatively, the game might require the player to "unlock door" with the key. However, the user's previous attempts didn't work.

Given that the user is stuck, the next step is to try the correct command. Since the key is in the inventory, the correct action is to "use key on door" or "unlock door with key". But the game might require "use key on door" without the "the". Alternatively, the game might accept "open door" after using the key. However, the user's last attempt was "use key on door", which failed. So maybe the correct command is "unlock door" with the key. But the user hasn't tried that yet.

Alternatively, the game might require the player to "open door" after using the key. But the user hasn't used the key yet. So the correct sequence is to use the key on the door to unlock it, then open the door. Since the user tried "use key on door" and it failed, maybe the correct command is "unlock door with key". But the game might not recognize that. Alternatively, the correct command is "use key on door" but the user needs to specify "the door".

Wait, the user's previous attempt was "use key on door" which resulted in an error. The game might require "use key on the door" with "the". Let me check the previous messages. The user was in the bedroom, and the door is "closed wooden door leading east". So the correct command might be "use key on the door". But the user tried "use key on door" without "the" and it failed. So the correct command is "use key on the door".

But the user's last attempt was "use key on door", which failed. So the next step is to try "use key on the door". However, the user is supposed to only output the command, not the explanation. So the correct next action is "use key on the door".

Okay, the user is trying to unlock the wooden door in the bedroom using the key from the antique trunk. They've tried several commands like "use key on door" and "unlock door", but the game isn't recognizing them. The error messages indicate that the commands are either not valid verbs or not properly formatted.

First, I need to recall the correct syntax for interacting with objects in TextWorld. Typically, commands follow the pattern "use [object] on [target]" or "unlock [object] with [key]". Since the user has the key, they need to use it on the door. The previous attempts might have failed because the command structure was incorrect, like missing "use" or not specifying the key properly.

The game's response after "use key on door" was "That's not a verb I recognise," which suggests that the command isn't in the expected format. The correct command should be "use key on door" but maybe the game expects "unlock door with key" instead. However, the user already has the key, so maybe the correct command is "unlock door" if the key is already in hand.

Wait, the user just opened the trunk and picked up the key. So the key is now in their inventory. The next step is to unlock the door with that key. The correct command might be "unlock door with key" or "use key on door". But the game might require a specific phrasing. Since the user tried "use key on door" and it didn't work, maybe the correct command is "unlock door" if the key is the correct tool. Alternatively, maybe "open door" if the key is the correct item.

But the game's previous response when the user tried "unlock door" was "The wooden door is fixed in place," which suggests that the door isn't unlocked yet. So the user needs to use the key to unlock it. The correct command is likely "use key on door" but the game might require "unlock door with key". However, the user's previous attempt was "use key on door" which didn't work. Maybe the game expects "unlock door" if the key is the correct item. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "open door" with the key.

Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "unlock the door with the key". But the user can't say "the" in some games. So perhaps "unlock door with key" is the correct command. But the user tried "use key on door" and it didn't work. The game might be expecting "unlock door" if the key is the correct item. However, the user has the key, so the correct command is probably "unlock door" since the key is in hand. But the game says the door is fixed, so maybe the user needs to use the key to unlock it. The correct command is "unlock door with key" or "use key on door". Since the user tried "use key on door" and it didn't work, maybe the correct command is "unlock door" without specifying the key, assuming the key is the correct item. Alternatively, maybe the game requires "open door" with the key. But the user's previous attempt was "unlock door" which didn't work. The game might be expecting "use key on door" but the user's input was "unlock door" which is why it's not working. Wait, the user's last attempt was "unlock door" which resulted in the door still being fixed. So the correct command is probably "use key on door" but the user might have missed the "use" part. But the user tried that and it didn't work. Maybe the game requires "unlock door with key". However, the user's previous command was "use key on door" which the game didn't recognize. So perhaps the correct command is "unlock door" if the key is the correct item. But the game says the door is fixed, so the user needs to use the key to unlock it. The correct command is likely "use key on door" but the game might not accept that. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "open door" with the key. But the user's previous attempts didn't work. The game might require "unlock door" if the key is the correct item. But the user has the key, so the correct command is "unlock door" to use the key. However, the game's response was "What do you want to unlock wooden door with?" which suggests that the user needs to specify the key. So the correct command is "unlock door with key". But the user can't say that. Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "use key on door". But the game didn't recognize it. Maybe the game expects "unlock door" and the key is already in hand. But the door is fixed, so the user needs to use the key. The correct command is "unlock door" but the game is prompting for the key. So the user needs to specify "unlock door with key". However, the user can't say that. The correct command is "use key on door" but the game doesn't recognize it. So maybe the correct command is "unlock door" and the key is the correct item. But the game is not accepting it. The user is stuck here, so the next step is to try "unlock door" again, but the game is prompting for the key. Therefore, the correct command is "unlock door with key".

The last interaction was when they tried to unlock the door with the key, but the game said they need to take the key first.

Wait, the user already picked up the key from the trunk. So maybe the issue is that they haven't picked it up yet? Let me check the previous steps again. The user first opened the trunk, which revealed the key. Then they tried to unlock the door. But the game said they need to take the key first. Oh, maybe the key is still in the trunk, so they need to pick it up before using it. 

So the correct sequence would be: open the trunk, pick up the key, then use the key to unlock the door. The user might have forgotten to pick up the key after taking it from the trunk. So the next action should be to pick up the key. But wait, in the game, when you open the trunk, the key is inside. So the user needs to take the key from the trunk. The previous step was opening the trunk, and the next step should be taking the key. But the user didn't do that yet. So the next action should be to pick up the key. Then, after that, they can use it to unlock the door. 

But looking at the user's last action, they tried to unlock the door with the key, but the game said they need to take the key first. That suggests that the key wasn't in their inventory yet. So the correct next step is to take the key from the trunk. Therefore, the next command should be "take old key" or "take key from trunk". But in the game's context, maybe the correct command is "take old key" since that's what's in the trunk. So the user needs to take the key first before using it to unlock the door.

Okay, let me try to figure out what to do next. The user has been following a series of steps in the TextWorld game. So far, they've opened the antique trunk, picked up the old key, and now they need to unlock the wooden door in the bedroom. 

The previous attempt to unlock the door failed because the key wasn't used properly. The game提示 said that the user needs to use the key on the door. But the user tried "unlock door" without specifying the key, which didn't work. Then they tried "unlock door with key", which was corrected by the game, indicating that they need to take the key first.

Wait, the user just took the old key from the trunk. So now, the next logical step is to use that key on the wooden door. The correct command should be something like "use key on door" or "unlock door with key". But the game might expect a specific phrasing. Let me check the previous interactions.

Earlier, when the user tried "use key on the door", the game said that's not a recognized verb. Then the user tried "unlock door with key", which was corrected by the game, indicating that the key needs to be used on the door. But the game might require the exact command structure. Maybe the correct command is "unlock door with key" but the game is expecting "use key on door". However, the user's last action was taking the key, so now they need to use it on the door.

Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "unlock door" after taking the key, as the key is now in the inventory. But the game might require specifying the key. Let me think about the possible commands. In TextWorld, the usual way to use an object is "use [object] on [target]" or "take [object]". Since the key is already taken, the next step is to use it on the door. So the correct command would be "use key on door". But the user tried that before and got an error. Wait, the user tried "use key on the door" and the game said it's not recognized. Maybe the game expects "use key on door" without the article. Let me check the previous error message: "That's not a verb I recognise." So maybe the correct command is "unlock door with key" but the game is expecting "use key on door". Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "unlock door" after taking the key, as the key is now in hand.

But the game's previous response when the user tried "unlock door with key" was that it's not recognized. So perhaps the correct command is "use key on door". Let me try that. The user has the key, so using it on the door should unlock it. Therefore, the next action should be "use key on door".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to unlock the door with the key. They have the key now, so the next step is to use it on the door. The previous attempt was "use key on door", but the system said that's not a recognized verb.

Hmm, maybe the correct command is "unlock door" instead of "use key on door". Or perhaps "open door with key". Wait, in some text adventures, the syntax is different. Maybe it's "unlock the door with the key". But the user has to follow the exact command format.

Looking back at the game's previous interactions, when they opened the trunk, they just said "open antique trunk". Then, after taking the key, they tried "use key on door", which didn't work. The system said "That's not a verb I recognise." So maybe the correct verb is "unlock" instead of "use". 

Alternatively, maybe the command is "unlock door with key". But the user might need to specify the key. Wait, the key is already in their inventory. So perhaps the correct command is "unlock door". Let me check the previous steps again.

The user has the key, so the next logical step is to unlock the door. The system might expect the command "unlock door" without specifying the key, since the key is already taken. But earlier, when they tried "unlock wooden door", it didn't work. Then they tried "use key on door", which was invalid. So maybe the correct command is "unlock door" again, or "open door".

Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "open door with key". But the system might not recognize that. Wait, the user is in the bedroom, and the door is closed. The key is in their inventory. So the correct action is to use the key to unlock the door. The correct command might be "unlock door with key". But the system might not accept that. Alternatively, maybe "use key on door" is the correct command, but the system is having issues with it.

Wait, the user tried "use key on door" and got an error. Maybe the correct command is "unlock door". Let me think. The game might have specific verbs. Since the user has the key, they need to unlock the door. The correct command is likely "unlock door". Let me try that.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps to open the wooden door in the bedroom. They first opened the antique trunk and found the old key. Then they tried to unlock the door but had some issues with the commands. After taking the key, they successfully unlocked the door. Now, the next step according to the original instructions was to open the wooden door, then venture east, open the screen door, and so on.

Since the door is now unlocked, the next logical step is to open it. The user has already unlocked it, so the next action should be to go through the door. The command would be "open wooden door" or "open door". But looking at the previous interactions, the game might expect a specific command. The user just unlocked the door, so maybe they need to "open" it again to proceed. Alternatively, since it's already unlocked, maybe "go east" is the next step after opening the door. But the instructions say after unlocking, open the door. So the correct command here is "open wooden door". Let me check the previous steps. The user said "unlock door" and then the game responded with "You unlock wooden door." So maybe the next step is to open it. But the user might need to use "open" as the command. Alternatively, since it's already unlocked, maybe they can just go through. But according to the original plan, after unlocking, they need to open the door. So the next action is "open wooden door".

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps given. They started by opening the antique trunk, picking up the key, then trying to unlock the door. After some trial and error, they successfully unlocked the door and opened it. Now they're in the next room, probably the hallway or something similar.

The next step in the original instructions was to venture east after opening the wooden door. So the user should go east. But the current prompt says "Do you think you're making the right actions..." so I need to check if the user is on the right track.

The user's last action was opening the wooden door, which was correct. Now they need to move east. The command should be "go east" or "venture east" as per the initial instructions. But the system might expect "go east" as the command. Let me check the previous interactions. The user was told to "venture east" after opening the door, so maybe the correct command is "go east". 

Wait, in the initial problem statement, the user was told to "venture east" after opening the door. But the system might have specific commands. Since the user has just opened the door, the next step is to move east. The correct command here would be "go east". The user has to input that. So the next action is "go east".

Okay, let me try to figure out what the next step should be. The user has been following the instructions to open the antique trunk, get the key, unlock the door, open the door, and then go east. They've already done that, and now they're in the kitchen.

The original goal was to pick up the milk from the garden, then go north, west, and sit it on the stove. But the current location is the kitchen. The user needs to proceed to the garden, pick up the milk, then go back north to the kitchen and put it on the stove.

In the kitchen, the screen door is leading east. The user's next step should be to open that screen door to go east into the garden. The previous action was going east from the bedroom, so maybe the screen door is the next obstacle. Once the screen door is open, they can proceed to the garden, find the milk, and continue with the rest of the steps.

So the correct command here would be to open the screen door. The user has to use the correct verb and object. The screen door is closed, so "open screen door" should be the next action.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the instructions step by step.

The next step in the original plan was to "attempt to head east" after opening the screen door. But the user's last action was opening the screen door, so the next logical step would be to try going east again.

Wait, but in the kitchen, the exits are north, south, east (screen door), and west (open wooden door). The user is in the kitchen now. The next instruction after opening the screen door was to "attempt to head east." So the command should be "go east." But the screen door is already open, so maybe they can just try to move east. The system might accept "go east" or "move east." But the user has been using "go" commands previously, like "go east" when they first moved from bedroom to kitchen. So the correct next action is "go east."

Okay, let me figure out the next step here. The user's goal is to pick up the milk from the garden and then proceed through the steps mentioned.

Currently, in the Garden, the user has found the milk on the floor. The next action according to the original plan is to "pick up the milk from the floor of the garden." So the immediate next step should be to pick up the milk. 

Looking at the available items in the Garden: there's lettuce, milk, half a bag of chips, and a shovel. The user needs to take the milk. The correct command would be "take milk" or "pick up milk." Since the user has been using commands like "take old key" and "open screen door," using "take milk" fits the pattern. 

I should check if there are any other steps needed. After picking up the milk, the user needs to "try to head north." But first, the milk must be picked up. So the next action is definitely taking the milk.
