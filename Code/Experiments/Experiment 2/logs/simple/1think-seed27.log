Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. Your first objective is to look and see that the antique trunk is open. After that, pick up the old key from the antique trunk in the bedroom. After that, insert the old key into the wooden door inside the bedroom's lock to unlock it. And then, ensure that the wooden door in the bedroom is open. After that, travel east. Okay, and then, doublecheck that the refrigerator is ajar. Then, take the milk from the refrigerator. Then, place the milk on the stove inside the kitchen. That's it!

-= Bedroom =-
You arrive in a bedroom. A standard kind of place.

You can make out a closed chest drawer. You can see an antique trunk. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a king-size bed. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Bedroom in TextWorld. Their goal is to open the antique trunk, get the old key, unlock the door, go east, check the fridge, take milk, and put it on the stove.

First, they tried to look at the antique trunk, but it's closed. The next step should be to open it. The trunk is described as strong and impossible to crack, so maybe there's a way to open it. The user might need to use the key from the trunk, but wait, the key is inside the trunk. Wait, the original instructions say to pick up the old key from the trunk. So first, open the trunk, then take the key.

But the trunk is closed. So the first action was looking at it, but it's still closed. The next logical step is to try to open it. The user might need to use a tool or find a way to open it. But in the game, maybe the action is simply to open it. So the next command should be to open the antique trunk.

Wait, the user's previous action was "look at antique trunk", which didn't work. Now, they need to try opening it. So the next action should be "open antique trunk". Then, after opening, they can pick up the key. Then proceed to the next steps.

GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

You open the antique trunk, revealing an old key.

Okay, the user has opened the antique trunk and found the old key. The next step according to the original plan is to pick up the key. So the next action should be to take the old key from the trunk. But wait, the trunk is already open, so maybe the key is inside. The command would be "take old key" or "pick up old key". But in TextWorld, the exact command might matter. Let me check the previous steps.

Earlier, the user was told to "pick up the old key from the antique trunk in the bedroom." So after opening the trunk, the key is inside. So the next action is to take the key. The correct command would be "take old key" or "pick up old key". But the game might require "take old key from antique trunk" but the user might just say "take old key". Let me see the previous interactions. The user first looked at the trunk, then opened it, and now the key is inside. So the next step is to pick it up. The command should be "take old key".

Okay, the user has taken the old key from the trunk. The next step in the original plan is to insert the key into the wooden door's lock to unlock it. So the next action should be to use the key on the door. The command would be "use old key on wooden door" or "insert old key into wooden door". But in TextWorld, the exact phrasing matters. The user was told to "insert the old key into the wooden door inside the bedroom's lock to unlock it." So the correct command is probably "unlock wooden door with old key" or "insert old key into wooden door". Let me check the previous commands. The user previously took the key, so now they need to unlock the door. The command should be "unlock wooden door" or "use old key on wooden door". The game might require "unlock wooden door with old key". But the user's previous actions were "open antique trunk" and "take old key", so the next step is to unlock the door. The correct command is "unlock wooden door".

Okay, the user has unlocked the wooden door. The next step according to the original plan is to ensure the door is open. So the action should be to open the door. But since they just unlocked it, maybe the door is already open. However, the user was instructed to "ensure that the wooden door in the bedroom is open." So perhaps the command is "open wooden door". Alternatively, since it's already unlocked, maybe just checking if it's open. But the game might require the action "open wooden door". Let me check the previous steps. The user unlocked the door, so the next step is to go east. Wait, the original plan said after unlocking, travel east. Wait, the original instructions said: "After that, travel east. Okay, and then, doublecheck that the refrigerator is ajar. Then, take the milk from the refrigerator. Then, place the milk on the stove inside the kitchen. That's it!"

Wait, the steps are: open trunk, take key, unlock door, then travel east. So after unlocking the door, the next action is to go east. The user is in the bedroom, and the door leads east. So the command is "go east". The previous steps were in the bedroom, so after unlocking the door, the next step is to go east. So the correct command is "go east".

Okay, the user tried to go east but the game said they have to open the wooden door first. So the next step is to open the door. But wait, they just unlocked it. Maybe the door is locked again? Or maybe "unlock" and "open" are different actions. The user was told to "ensure that the wooden door in the bedroom is open." So perhaps they need to open it again. The command would be "open wooden door". Let me check the previous interactions. The user unlocked the door, but the game says they need to open it. So the correct action is to open the door.

Okay, the user has opened the wooden door. Now, according to the original plan, they should travel east. The previous attempt to go east was blocked because the door wasn't open. Now that the door is open, the next step is to go east. So the command should be "go east". Let me check the game's current state. The user is in the bedroom, and the door leads east. After opening the door, the next action is to move east. So the correct command is "go east".

-= Kitchen =-
You've entered a kitchen.

You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a refrigerator. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can make out a counter. The counter is normal. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You see a stove. The stove is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You can see a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

Okay, the user is in the Kitchen now. The original goal was to check the refrigerator, take milk, put it on the stove. The current step is to double-check that the refrigerator is ajar. So the next action should be to look at the refrigerator. The command is "look at refrigerator" or "check refrigerator". But in the game, maybe "open refrigerator" if it's closed. The user was told to "doublecheck that the refrigerator is ajar", so maybe just checking its state. The correct command is "look at refrigerator" or "check refrigerator". Let me see the previous steps. The user is in the kitchen, and the refrigerator is mentioned as a gleam in the corner. So the next action is to check the refrigerator.
