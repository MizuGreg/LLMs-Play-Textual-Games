Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First, it would be good if you could open the chest drawer within the bedroom. And then, take the old key from the chest drawer within the bedroom. With the old key, unlock the wooden door. Then, ensure that the wooden door within the bedroom is open. After that, make an effort to head east. If you can accomplish that, open the refrigerator inside the kitchen. After that, recover the lettuce from the refrigerator in the kitchen. After that, rest the lettuce on the stove. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Bedroom =-
You're now in the bedroom. Let's see what's in here.

You can make out a closed chest drawer. You see an antique trunk. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You make out a king-size bed. The king-size bed is normal. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me see. The user is in the bedroom and just opened the chest drawer, finding an old key. The next step according to the task was to take the old key from the chest drawer. So after opening it, the key is now accessible. The next action should be to pick up the key.

Wait, the user's previous action was "open chest drawer", which worked. Now, the key is inside. So the next command should be "take old key". But I need to check the environment description again. The chest drawer was closed, and after opening, the key is revealed. So taking the key from the chest drawer is the next logical step. Then, after taking the key, the next step is to unlock the wooden door. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action is definitely taking the key. Then, use the key to unlock the door. But the user's next input should be the command to take the key. Let me make sure there's no other step in between. The task says "take the old key from the chest drawer within the bedroom." So after opening the drawer, the key is there. So the next action is "take old key".

Okay, let's see. The user has already opened the chest drawer and taken the old key. The next step according to the task was to use the old key to unlock the wooden door. So the next action should be to unlock the door. But wait, the current location is the bedroom, and there's a closed wooden door leading east. So the command would be to unlock the door with the old key. But in TextWorld, sometimes you need to use the correct verbs. Let me check the previous actions. The user opened the chest drawer, then took the key. Now, they need to unlock the door. The correct command here is probably "unlock wooden door" or "unlock door". But since the key is old, maybe "unlock" is the right verb. So the next action is to unlock the wooden door.

Okay, let's see. The user has to follow a series of steps in the TextWorld game. So far, they've opened the chest drawer, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door, and the score is up to 3/4. The next step according to the original task was to ensure the wooden door is open. Since they just unlocked it, maybe they need to check if it's open. But in the game, sometimes you have to explicitly open it. Wait, the task said "ensure that the wooden door within the bedroom is open." But they just unlocked it, so maybe they need to open it now. Or maybe the unlocking is enough. But the user's previous action was unlocking, so maybe the next step is to go east. The original instructions said after unlocking, make an effort to head east. So the next action should be going east. Let me check the previous messages. The user was in the bedroom, unlocked the door, and the next step is to head east. So the correct command here is "go east".

Okay, the user tried to go east but the wooden door is still closed. They have the old key, which they used to unlock it. Wait, the previous step said they unlocked the wooden door. Maybe the game's response is conflicting. Let me check the history.

Earlier, the user unlocked the wooden door, and the score increased. Then they tried to go east, but the game said they have to open the door first. That's confusing because they just unlocked it. Maybe there's a mistake in the game's feedback. But according to the game's message, the door needs to be opened. So the next step should be to open the door again. But they already unlocked it. Hmm. Maybe the game considers unlocking and opening different actions. So the user needs to open the door again. So the correct action here is to open the wooden door again. But the user already unlocked it. Wait, maybe the door is locked but not open. Unlocking makes it possible to open. So the user needs to open the door after unlocking. So the next action should be to open the door. But the user tried to go east and the game said they need to open the door. So the correct next step is to open the door. So the answer is open wooden door.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps to open the wooden door and now they've successfully opened it. The next step in the original task was to go east after opening the door. The user tried to go east but was told they need to open the wooden door first. Then they did open the door, and now they're at the bedroom again with the door open.

So, the next logical step would be to move east from the bedroom. The previous attempt to go east failed because the door was closed, but now the door is open. So the user should try going east again. The command would be "go east" to proceed to the next area, which should be the kitchen. Then, the next steps involve opening the refrigerator, taking the lettuce, putting it on the stove, and winning. So the immediate next action is to go east.

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. An usual one.

A closed refrigerator is here. You scan the room for a counter, and you find a counter. The counter is ordinary. But the thing is empty. You move on, clearly infuriated by your TextWorld experience. You see a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You see a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island, so there's that.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps to complete the game. They started in the bedroom, opened the chest drawer, took the old key, unlocked the wooden door, and then went east. After opening the door, they entered the kitchen. The current location is the kitchen, and the next step according to the original task was to open the refrigerator in the kitchen.

Looking at the kitchen description, there's a closed refrigerator mentioned. The user's next action should be to open it. The previous actions have been successful, and the score has increased each time. The user needs to continue following the steps: open the fridge, take the lettuce, put it on the stove, and then win. So the correct command here is to open the refrigerator.

Okay, the user has to follow a series of steps in the TextWorld game. Let me recap the current state.

First, they were in the bedroom, opened the chest drawer, took the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, then went east into the kitchen. Now, in the kitchen, they opened the refrigerator and found a lettuce and a half-bag of chips. The next step according to the original task was to take the lettuce from the refrigerator. So the next action should be to take the lettuce. The user's previous action was opening the refrigerator, so the next command should be "take lettuce". That makes sense because the goal was to recover the lettuce from the fridge. I need to make sure that's the correct next step. Also, the user's score has increased, so they're on track. The next step after taking the lettuce is to put it on the stove, but that's after taking it. So the immediate action is taking the lettuce.

Okay, the user has to rest the lettuce on the stove. They're in the kitchen now. The previous steps were opening the refrigerator, taking the lettuce. Now, the next logical step is to go to the stove. But wait, the user is currently in the kitchen. The stove is in the kitchen, so they need to go there. The command should be "go to stove" or "go to the stove". But in the game's context, maybe the exact command is "go to stove". Let me check the previous actions. The user was told to "rest the lettuce on the stove". So first, they need to be at the stove. The current location is the kitchen, and the stove is here. So the next action is to go to the stove. Then, put the lettuce there. But the user has the lettuce in hand. So the next command is "go to stove".

Okay, the user is trying to rest the lettuce on the stove. They tried "go to stove" but that didn't work. Let me check the current environment.

In the Kitchen, the user has the lettuce. The stove is mentioned as being empty. The possible actions here are probably interacting with the stove. Since "go to stove" didn't work, maybe the correct command is to "put lettuce on stove" or something similar. But the user needs to first be at the stove's location. Wait, maybe the user is already at the stove but needs to use the correct verb. Alternatively, maybe the stove is a noun that can be acted upon directly. Let me think about the previous commands. The user was told to "rest the lettuce on the stove," so the action would be putting it there. The correct command might be "put lettuce on stove" or "rest lettuce on stove." But the system might expect a specific phrasing. Since the user tried "go to stove" and it didn't work, perhaps the correct action is to use the "put" command directly. So the next step is to try "put lettuce on stove."
