It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First thing I need you to do is to make absolutely sure that the antique trunk is opened. And then, take the old key from the antique trunk within the bedroom. After that, check that the wooden door within the bedroom is unlocked with the old key. After that, look and see that the wooden door is open. After that, try to move east. After that, open the screen door in the kitchen. And then, venture east. Then, attempt to travel south. And then, lift the lettuce from the floor of the garden. If you have picked up the lettuce, travel north. And then, try to move west. Then, rest the lettuce on the stove. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Bedroom =-
I am excited to announce that you are now in the bedroom. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You make out a chest drawer. Hmm. You always thought you'd be more excited to see a chest drawer in a room. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to an antique trunk. You can make out a king-size bed. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me see. The user is in the bedroom and just opened the antique trunk, which gave them an old key. The next step according to the task was to take the old key from the trunk. So after opening the trunk, the next logical step is to pick up the key.

Wait, the user's previous action was "open antique trunk", and the response was that the trunk reveals an old key. Now the user is asking if they're on the right track and what the next action should be. The user's score is up to 1/2, so they need to continue following the steps.

The original task says after opening the trunk, take the old key. So the next command should be "take old key". Then, check if the wooden door is unlocked with the key. But the user hasn't done that yet. But the user's current prompt is asking for the next action after confirming the steps so far. So the immediate next step is to take the key. Then proceed to unlock the door. But the user's question is whether they're close. The user is in the bedroom, so after taking the key, they need to unlock the door. But the user's next action should be "take old key" here. Then, after that, check the door. But the user's current prompt is asking for the next action, so the answer should be "take old key".

Okay, let's see. The user has to open the antique trunk first, which they did. Then take the old key from it. They did that too. Next step was to check the wooden door in the bedroom is unlocked with the old key. So now, they need to unlock the door using the key they just picked up.

Wait, the current location is the bedroom. The wooden door leading east is closed. So the next action should be to unlock that door with the old key. The command would be "unlock wooden door" or something similar. But in the game's context, maybe it's "unlock door" since the door is described as "closed wooden door". The user has the key, so using the key to unlock it makes sense. Then after unlocking, they need to open the door. So first, unlock it, then open it. But the instructions say to check that it's unlocked and then look to see if it's open. So maybe the steps are: unlock the door with the key, then open it. But the user has to perform each action step by step. So the next action after taking the key is to unlock the door. So the command would be "unlock wooden door" or "unlock door". Let me check the previous steps. The user was in the bedroom, and the door is closed. So the correct command here is to unlock the door with the key. The user has the key, so they can use it to unlock the door. Therefore, the next action is "unlock wooden door".

Okay, let's see. The user has to follow a series of steps in the TextWorld game. So far, they've opened the antique trunk, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door in the bedroom. The next step according to the original task was to check that the wooden door is open. Wait, the user just unlocked it, but maybe they need to verify it's open. But in the game, after unlocking, the door should be open. But maybe the game requires explicitly opening it? Or maybe the user needs to check the state.

Looking back at the original instructions: After unlocking the wooden door, the next step is to "look and see that the wooden door is open." So the user needs to confirm that the door is open. But in the game, after unlocking, the door is open. However, maybe the game requires the player to open it again. Wait, the user just unlocked it. So perhaps the next action is to open the door. But the door was already unlocked. Hmm.

Wait, the original task says: "check that the wooden door within the bedroom is unlocked with the old key. After that, look and see that the wooden door is open." So first, unlock it (which the user did), then check that it's open. But maybe the door is unlocked but not open. So the user needs to open it. But how? Maybe the door is locked and needs to be opened. Wait, the user has the key, so after unlocking, they can open it. But maybe the game requires the player to open the door. So the next action would be to open the door. But the user is in the bedroom, and the door leads east. So the next step is to open the door. But the user has already unlocked it. Maybe the game requires the player to open it. So the next action is "open wooden door". But the user is in the bedroom, and the door is east. So maybe the command is "open wooden door" or "open door east".

Wait, the user is in the bedroom, and the wooden door is leading east. So after unlocking, the next step is to open it. But the user just unlocked it. So maybe the next action is to open the door. But the user has already unlocked it. Maybe the game requires the player to open it. So the next action is "open wooden door". But the user is in the bedroom, so the command would be "open wooden door". Alternatively, maybe the door is already open. But the user needs to check that it's open. So the next action is to look at the door. But the game might require the player to open it. So the next action is "open wooden door". Let me check the previous steps.

The user has unlocked the door. The next step is to check that it's open. But in the game, after unlocking, the door is open. So maybe the next action is to move east. But the original task says after unlocking, check that the door is open. So maybe the user needs to check the state. But how? The game might require the player to open the door. So the next action is "open wooden door". Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to move east. Wait, the original task says: after unlocking, look and see that the door is open. Then, try to move east. So the user needs to check that the door is open, then move east. So after unlocking, the user needs to check if the door is open. But how? The user can't check unless they open it. So perhaps the next action is to open the door. But the user has already unlocked it. Maybe the game requires the player to open it. So the next action is "open wooden door". But the user is in the bedroom, so the command would be "open wooden door". But the user has already unlocked it. Maybe the game is designed so that after unlocking, the door is open. So the next step is to move east. But the original task says after checking that the door is open, move east.

Looking back at the previous interactions, the user used "go north" as a command. However, in the current context, after opening the door, the correct action is to move east. So the next command should be "move east" or "go east". But the user's previous action was "open wooden door", which was correct. Now, the next step is to move east. The user's last message says "Do you think you're making the right actions..." and the assistant should respond with the next action. So the correct next command is "go east".

Now, the next step according to the original task was to "rest the lettuce on the stove." The user is in the kitchen now. The stove is mentioned in the kitchen description. So the next action should be to put the lettuce on the stove. But the command needs to be in the correct format. The previous actions were things like "take lettuce", "go north", etc. So the correct command here would be "put lettuce on stove". But I need to check if that's the exact phrasing the game expects. Since the user has the lettuce in hand, the action is to place it on the stove. So the answer should be "put lettuce on stove".
