Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, you could, like, ensure that the chest drawer is open. And then, take the old key from the chest drawer inside the bedroom. With the old key, doublecheck that the wooden door is unlocked. And then, open the wooden door within the bedroom. Then, attempt to go east. Then, make absolutely sure that the screen door inside the kitchen is opened. And then, attempt to venture east. Next, travel south. And then, lift the half of a bag of chips from the floor of the garden. Then, make an effort to move north. If you can finish that, venture west. And then, rest the half of a bag of chips on the stove. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Bedroom =-
You've just sauntered into a bedroom. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

You can see a chest drawer. You can see an antique trunk. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You see a king-size bed. The king-size bed is usual. The king-size bed appears to be empty.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me see. The user is in a text adventure game, and they've just opened the chest drawer in the bedroom, finding an old key. The task was to take the old key from the chest drawer, then check the wooden door, open it, go east, etc.

So the next step after opening the chest drawer and getting the key is to take the key. The user needs to pick up the old key. Then, they have to double-check that the wooden door is unlocked. Wait, the wooden door was closed before. So maybe the key is for the door. So after taking the key, they should unlock the door. Then open it. Then go east. 

But the user's current location is the bedroom. The wooden door leading east is closed. So the correct sequence is: take the old key, unlock the door, open it, then go east. The user has already opened the chest drawer, so the next action should be to take the key. The prompt says to only output the action, so the next command should be "take old key".
