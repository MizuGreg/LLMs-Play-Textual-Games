Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First, it would be great if you could make sure that the antique trunk is ajar. After that, recover the old key from the antique trunk. Then, make it so that the wooden door inside the bedroom is unlocked with the old key. Then, ensure that the wooden door inside the bedroom is open. Then, take a trip east. And then, ensure that the screen door is open. After that, attempt to travel east. Okay, and then, make an effort to head south. Then, pick up the half of a bag of chips from the floor of the garden. With the half of a bag of chips, attempt to go to the north. And then, try to travel west. Following that, sit the half of a bag of chips on the stove. That's it!

-= Bedroom =-
Well, here we are in a bedroom.

You see a closed chest drawer. You see an antique trunk. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a king-size bed. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me see. The user wants me to go through a series of steps in this text-based game. So far, I've opened the antique trunk and found the old key. The next steps mentioned were recovering the key, which I did, then using it to unlock the wooden door in the bedroom, opening it, then going east, and so on.

Wait, the user's initial instructions said after getting the key, I need to make sure the wooden door inside the bedroom is unlocked and then open it. So the next logical step after getting the key is to use it on the door. The current location is the bedroom, and there's a closed wooden door leading east. So I should try to unlock it with the key. The command would be to use the key on the door. But in the game's context, maybe the correct command is to unlock the door with the key. Let me check the previous steps again.

The user said: "recover the old key from the antique trunk. Then, make it so that the wooden door inside the bedroom is unlocked with the old key." So after getting the key, I need to unlock the door. The door is closed, so the action would be to unlock it. But how is that done in the game? Typically, you might use the key on the door. So the next action should be to unlock the wooden door with the key. The command would be "unlock wooden door" or "use key on wooden door". But the game might expect a specific syntax. Since the user previously said "open antique trunk", which worked, maybe the correct command here is "unlock wooden door". Alternatively, maybe "use key on wooden door". But the user's instruction says to make the door unlocked, so perhaps the correct action is to unlock it. Let me proceed with that.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in the TextWorld game. So far, they've opened the antique trunk and found an old key. Then they tried to unlock the wooden door east of the bedroom, but the door is fixed in place. Now they need to figure out the next step.

The original goal was to make sure the antique trunk is ajar, recover the key, unlock the wooden door, open it, go east, open the screen door, travel east again, then go south, pick up the half-bag of chips, use it to go north, travel west, and put the chips on the stove. 

But the current problem is that the wooden door is fixed. Maybe "unlock" isn't the right command here. Maybe the door is locked, and they need to use the key to unlock it. Wait, they already have the key. So perhaps the next step is to use the key on the door. But the previous action was "unlock wooden door", which didn't work. Maybe the correct command is "use old key on wooden door" or something similar. But the game's commands might be more straightforward. Let me check the previous interactions.

The user tried "unlock wooden door" but the door is fixed. So maybe the key is needed to unlock it. The key is in the trunk, which they already opened. So the next step should be to use the key on the door. The correct command would be "use old key on wooden door" or "unlock wooden door with old key". But the game might require a specific syntax. Since the user previously tried "unlock wooden door" and it didn't work, maybe they need to use the key first. Alternatively, maybe the door is locked, and the key is needed to unlock it. So the next action should be to unlock the door with the key. Let me think of the possible commands. The user has the key, so the next step is to use it on the door. So the correct command would be "unlock wooden door" again, but maybe the key is required. Alternatively, maybe the door is locked, and the key is needed. So the next action is to use the key on the door. But the user might need to pick up the key first. Wait, they already have the key from the trunk. So the next step is to unlock the door with the key. The correct command is probably "unlock wooden door" again, but maybe the game requires using the key. Alternatively, maybe the door is locked, and the key is needed. So the next action is to unlock the door with the key. The user's previous action was "unlock wooden door", which didn't work. So maybe the correct command is "use old key on wooden door". But the game might not accept that. Alternatively, maybe the door is locked, and the key is in the player's inventory. So the correct command is "unlock wooden door" again. But the system message says to only output the action. So the next action should be "unlock wooden door" again. Wait, but the user tried that already. Maybe the door is locked, and the key is needed. So the next step is to use the key on the door. The correct command would be "use old key on wooden door". But the user might need to first pick up the key. Wait, they already have the key from the trunk. So the next step is to use the key to unlock the door. Therefore, the next action is "use old key on wooden door".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in the TextWorld game. So far, they've opened the antique trunk and found an old key. Then they tried to unlock the wooden door, but that wasn't the right command. The error message says "That's not a verb I recognise," so the previous action was incorrect.

The next step in the original instructions was to "make it so that the wooden door inside the bedroom is unlocked with the old key." The user tried "unlock wooden door," which didn't work. Maybe the correct command is to use the key on the door. Since the key is in the trunk, they need to pick it up first. Wait, in the previous step, they opened the trunk and found the key, but did they pick it up? The game might require picking up the key before using it.

So the correct sequence would be: pick up the old key, then use it on the wooden door. The user might have forgotten to pick up the key first. Let me check the previous messages. The user said "use old key on wooden door," but maybe the key isn't in their inventory yet. So the correct action is to pick up the key first. Then, use it on the door. But the user's last action was "use old key on wooden door," which failed. So the next step should be to pick up the key. Wait, but the key was already retrieved from the trunk. Wait, in the game, when you open the trunk, you find the key, but you have to pick it up. Maybe the user didn't pick it up yet. So the correct action is to pick up the key first. Then, use it on the door. So the next command should be "pick up old key," then "use old key on wooden door." But the user's last action was "use old key on wooden door," which didn't work. So the error is because the key wasn't picked up. Therefore, the next action should be to pick up the key. But in the game, maybe the key is already in the inventory. Wait, the user's previous action was "open antique trunk," which revealed the key. Then, the next step was "unlock wooden door," which was incorrect. Then "use old key on wooden door," which failed. So perhaps the correct command is to "use old key on wooden door," but maybe the door is locked, and the key is needed. Alternatively, maybe the correct command is to "unlock wooden door with old key." But the game might have specific verbs. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to pick up the key first. So the next action should be "pick up old key," then "unlock wooden door." But the user's last action was "use old key on wooden door," which failed. So the correct next step is to pick up the key. Wait, but the key was already in the trunk. Maybe the user didn't pick it up yet. So the correct action is to pick up the key. Then, use it on the door. So the next command should be "pick up old key." Then, "unlock wooden door." But the user's previous action was "use old key on wooden door," which didn't work. Therefore, the next action should be to pick up the key. But in the game, maybe the key is already in the inventory. Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "use old key on wooden door," but the game requires the key to be in hand. So the user needs to pick it up first. Therefore, the next action is "pick up old key."

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in the TextWorld game. So far, they've opened the antique trunk, found the old key, and picked it up. The next step in their original plan was to "make it so that the wooden door inside the bedroom is unlocked with the old key." But when they tried to use the key on the door, the game didn't recognize "use old key on wooden door" as a valid command. Instead, they tried "unlock wooden door," which didn't work either.

Wait, maybe the correct command is to "unlock the wooden door with the old key." But the game might expect a specific phrasing. Let me check the previous interactions. The user tried "unlock wooden door" and got a response that it's fixed. Then they tried "use old key on wooden door," which was invalid. Then they picked up the key, and now the score is 2/4.

So, perhaps the correct action is to "unlock the wooden door" using the key. But since the game didn't recognize "use old key on wooden door," maybe the correct command is just "unlock wooden door" after having the key. Alternatively, maybe the key is already in hand, so the next step is to "unlock the door" with the key. But the game might require the exact phrasing. Let me think about the possible commands. The user has the key, so maybe the correct action is "unlock wooden door" again, but the game says it's fixed. Wait, the wooden door was closed, but after trying to unlock it, the game says it's fixed. Maybe the door is locked, and the key is needed to unlock it. So the correct command would be to "unlock the wooden door" using the key. But since the game didn't accept "use old key on wooden door," maybe the correct command is "unlock wooden door" again. Alternatively, maybe the key is in the inventory, so the correct action is to "unlock the door" with the key. But the game might require the exact syntax. The user has the key, so the next step is to use it on the door. The correct command might be "unlock wooden door" since the key is already picked up. Let me check the previous steps again. The user tried "unlock wooden door" and got a response that the door is fixed. Then tried "use old key on wooden door" which was invalid. Then picked up the key. Now, the next action should be to unlock the door with the key. The correct command is probably "unlock wooden door" again. But the game might require the key to be used. Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "use key on wooden door." But the key is called "old key," so maybe "use old key on wooden door." But the game didn't accept that. Wait, the user tried "use old key on wooden door" and got an error. So maybe the correct command is "unlock wooden door" again. But the door is locked, so maybe the key is needed. Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "open wooden door." But the door is a wooden door, so "unlock" is the right verb. Since the user has the key, the next step is to unlock the door. The correct command is "unlock wooden door." Let's try that.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following a series of steps in the TextWorld game. The goal was to open the antique trunk, get the old key, unlock the wooden door in the bedroom, open it, then go east, open the screen door, travel east again, go south, pick up the half-bag of chips, use it to go north, travel west, and finally put the chips on the stove.

So far, the user has successfully opened the antique trunk, retrieved the old key, unlocked the wooden door, and opened it. The next step mentioned was to take a trip east. The user's last action was unlocking the wooden door, which was part of the sequence. Now, after the door is unlocked and opened, the next logical step would be to go through the door east. The user's next action should be "go east" to proceed. The assistant needs to make sure that the command is correct and matches the game's expected input. Since the user is in the bedroom and the door is open, "go east" is the right command here. The score is increasing, so the user is on the right track. The next steps after that would involve the screen door, but currently, the focus is on moving east from the bedroom. So the correct next action is "go east".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in the TextWorld game. So far, they've opened the antique trunk, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door, but couldn't go east because the door wasn't open. Now they need to open the door.

Wait, the previous action was "go east", but the game responded that the door needs to be open first. The user had already unlocked the door, but maybe they didn't open it yet. The command "unlock wooden door" might have just unlocked it, but opening it is different. So the next step should be to open the door. But how? Maybe the correct command is "open wooden door" instead of "unlock". Let me check the previous interactions.

Earlier, the user tried "unlock wooden door" and it worked, but the door was still closed. So maybe "unlock" is for the lock, but opening the door requires a different command. Alternatively, maybe the door is locked and needs to be unlocked, then opened. But the user already unlocked it. Hmm. The game might require "open" after unlocking. So the next action should be "open wooden door" to make it open, then go east. But the user's last action was "go east" which failed because the door wasn't open. So the correct next step is to open the door. The user needs to use "open wooden door" command.

The next step in their original plan was to "ensure that the screen door is open. After that, attempt to travel east." Wait, but after opening the wooden door, they might have moved east into a new area.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the room where they just opened the wooden door. The next action they need to take is to open the screen door. But the game's response after opening the wooden door says "You open wooden door." So maybe the screen door is in the same room or the next room. But the user's next step was to open the screen door, then go east. However, the user's last action was opening the wooden door, so now they need to check if the screen door is there.

Wait, the original instructions said after unlocking the wooden door, they need to ensure it's open, then go east. But the user tried to go east before opening the door, which was blocked. Now that the door is open, they can go east. But the next step in their plan was to open the screen door. However, maybe the screen door is part of the current room. Alternatively, maybe after going east, they'll encounter the screen door.

But the user's last action was opening the wooden door, and the current room is now the east room. So the next step would be to go east.

So the next action should be "go east" again. But the user's next step in their plan was to open the screen door. However, maybe the screen door is in the east room.

Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The kitchen island is standard. On the kitchen island you see a note.

So far, they've opened the antique trunk, retrieved the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door leading east, and moved into the kitchen. The current location is the kitchen, and the user is at step 5/8.

The next step in the original plan was to "ensure that the screen door is open." In the kitchen description, there's a closed screen door leading east. The user hasn't interacted with it yet. So the logical next action would be to open the screen door. However, the user's last action was "go east," which led them to the kitchen. Now, they need to address the screen door.

But wait, the user's next instruction after getting to the kitchen is to "ensure that the screen door is open." So the correct action here is to open the screen door. The user has to check if the screen door is closed and then open it. The game's feedback after moving to the kitchen mentions the screen door is closed, so the next step is to open it. Then, after that, the user is supposed to "attempt to travel east" again. But first, the screen door needs to be open. So the immediate next action is to open the screen door.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following a series of steps in the TextWorld game. Their goal is to perform several actions in a specific order. Let me recap the current state to make sure I don't miss anything.

First, they started in the Bedroom. They opened the antique trunk, found an old key, unlocked the wooden door, and then went east into the Kitchen. Then they opened the screen door. Now, the next step according to the original instructions was to "attempt to travel east" after opening the screen door. But the user just opened the screen door, and the next prompt is asking for the next action.

Looking at the current location, they're in the Kitchen. The Kitchen has a screen door leading east (which they just opened), a wooden door west (open), and exits north and south. The user's next action should be to go east through the screen door they just opened. But the previous attempt to go east might have been blocked because the screen door was closed, but now it's open. So the correct next step is to go east again.

Wait, but in the last interaction, after opening the screen door, the user's next action was to go east. However, the system message says that the user is in the Kitchen, and the screen door is now open. So the next logical step is to go east through that door. The user's last action was opening the screen door, so the next command should be "go east" again. Let me check if there are any other steps required. The original plan after opening the screen door was to attempt to travel east, then try to go north, then west, etc. But according to the current state, after opening the screen door, the next step is to go east. So the correct command here is "go east".

You arrive in a backyard. A standard one.

You make out a set of chairs. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a bbq. The bbq is ordinary. However, the bbq, like an empty bbq, has nothing on it. Hm. Oh well You see a patio table. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is an open screen door leading west. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following a series of steps in the TextWorld game. Their goal is to perform several actions in a specific order. So far, they've opened the antique trunk, retrieved the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door in the bedroom, then moved east to the kitchen, opened the screen door, went east again to the backyard. Now, the current location is the backyard, and the next step according to the original instructions was to "try to travel east" after opening the screen door. But in the backyard, the user is at the backyard, and the next action suggested was going south. However, the user's next move after the backyard was to go south, but the original plan was to go east again.

Wait, the user's original plan after the backyard was to "try to travel east" but the backyard's east is the screen door leading west. So maybe the user is confused. But according to the game's current state, the backyard has an open screen door west and an unguarded exit south. The user's next action was to go south, which is allowed. But according to the original goal, after the backyard, the next step was to "try to travel east" but that might not be possible. Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go south from the backyard. Let me check the original instructions again.

Original instructions: After opening the screen door, attempt to travel east. Then, try to travel west. Then, sit the half of a bag of chips on the stove. Wait, but the user hasn't picked up the half of a bag of chips yet. So perhaps the user is at the backyard, and the next step is to go south. But the original plan was to go east after opening the screen door. However, in the backyard, east is the screen door leading west. So maybe the user is supposed to go south from the backyard. The user's last action was going east from the kitchen to the backyard. Now, in the backyard, the next step is to go south. But according to the original plan, after the backyard, the user was supposed to go east again, but that's not possible. So maybe the user is at the backyard, and the next action is to go south. The user's next action is to go south. But according to the original plan, after the backyard, the user was supposed to go east, but that's not possible. So the user might have to go south. The user's next action is to go south. Then, after that, the user would be in the garden or another area. But the original plan was to pick up the half of a bag of chips from the garden. So maybe the user is in the garden now. Then, with the chips, go north, then west. Then sit the chips on the stove. So the user's current location is the backyard, and the next step is to go south to the garden. So the correct action here is to go south. The user's last action was go east to the backyard, and now the next step is to go south. So the answer should be go south.

Okay, the user has been following a series of steps in the TextWorld game. Let me recap the current state to make sure I understand where they are.

Starting from the bedroom, they opened the antique trunk, found the old key, unlocked the wooden door, opened it, and went east to the kitchen. Then they opened the screen door, went east to the backyard, and then south to the garden. Now, in the garden, they see a tomato plant, an apple, a half of a bag of chips, and a shovel on the floor.

The original goal was to pick up the half of a bag of chips from the garden and then try to go north with it. The user's last action was "go south", which led them to the garden. Now, the next step should be to pick up the half of the bag of chips. The user's instruction mentioned picking it up and then attempting to go north. So the immediate action here is to pick up the chips. Once that's done, they can try going north. Let me check if there's any other step needed. The user also had to sit the chips on the stove later, but that's after getting to the north. So currently, the priority is to pick up the chips. The correct command here would be "take half of a bag of chips" or simply "pick up half of a bag of chips". But in the game's context, the exact phrasing might matter. Looking back, the user saw "a half of a bag of chips on the floor", so the correct action is to take it. Therefore, the next command should be "take half of a bag of chips".

Okay, let's see. The user has been following a series of steps in this text-based game. Their goal was to open the antique trunk, get the key, unlock and open the bedroom door, go east, open the screen door, then go east again, and eventually reach the garden where they need to pick up the half-bag of chips and use it to go north. 

So far, they've managed to open the antique trunk, get the key, unlock the bedroom door, open it, go through to the kitchen, open the screen door, go east to the backyard, then south to the garden. In the garden, they picked up the half-bag of chips. Now, the next step according to the original plan was to "attempt to go to the north" with the chips. But the user's last action was taking the chips, so the next command should be to go north.

But wait, in the garden description, it says "You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked." So going north is possible. The user has the half-bag of chips, so maybe using it to go north is the next step. However, the game might require the action to be "go north" without specifying the item, since the instruction was to "attempt to go to the north" with the chips. But in the game's context, maybe the chips are just a item picked up, and the next step is to go north. The user's last action was taking the chips, so the next command should be "go north".

Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they have to follow a series of steps to achieve the goal. So far, they've opened the antique trunk, retrieved the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door in the bedroom, then went east to the kitchen, opened the screen door, went east again to the backyard, and then south to the garden. In the garden, they picked up the half-bag of chips and tried to go north back to the backyard.

Now, the next step in the original plan was to "attempt to go to the north" with the half of a bag of chips. But when they tried going north from the garden, they ended up back in the backyard. The current location is the backyard again, and the user is prompted to decide the next action.

Looking at the current environment in the backyard, there's an open screen door leading west and an unguarded exit to the south. The user's next action should probably be to go south again, as that's the unguarded exit mentioned. But wait, the original goal also included sitting the half of a bag of chips on the stove. However, the user is currently in the backyard, not the kitchen where the stove is. So maybe they need to go back to the kitchen first.

But the user's last action was going north from the garden, which brought them back to the backyard. The next step in the original instructions was to "try to travel west" after going north. Wait, the original plan said: "With the half of a bag of chips, attempt to go to the north. And then, try to travel west." So after going north, they should try west. But in the current state, they are in the backyard, and the screen door is open to the west. So maybe the next action is to go west from the backyard.

But the user is at the backyard, and the screen door is open west. So "go west" would be the next step. However, the user's last action was going north, which led them back to the backyard. The current location is the backyard, and the next step is to try traveling west. So the correct command would be "go west".

But wait, the user has the half of a bag of chips. The original plan said to sit it on the stove, but the stove is in the kitchen. So maybe the user needs to go back to the kitchen, but the current location is the backyard. So the steps would be: go west from the backyard (through the screen door) to the kitchen, then maybe sit the chips on the stove. But the user's next action is to "try to travel west" as per the original plan. So the answer should be "go west".

Their goal was to open the antique trunk, get the key, unlock and open the bedroom door, go east, open the screen door, then proceed to the garden, pick up the half-bag of chips, and eventually use it to go north and west.

However, the user's last action was going west from the backyard, which brought them back to the kitchen. 

Looking at the current location (Kitchen), the possible directions are north, east, west, south. The user's next step would likely be to go north, as that's the unguarded entrance mentioned. But the user's previous action was going west, so maybe they need to check if there's anything else to do here. However, the original plan after the garden was to go north, then west.

Okay, let's see. The user has been navigating through different rooms in the TextWorld game. Their goal was to open the antique trunk, get the key, unlock and open the bedroom door, go east, open the screen door, then proceed to the garden to pick up the half-bag of chips and use it to go north, then west, and finally sit the chips on the stove.

So far, they've managed to open the antique trunk, get the key, unlock the bedroom door, open it, go east to the kitchen, open the screen door, go east to the backyard, then south to the garden where they picked up the chips. Then they went north back to the backyard, west to the kitchen, and then north again to the bathroom. 

Now, the current location is the bathroom. The next step in the original plan was to sit the half-bag of chips on the stove. But the stove is in the kitchen, not the bathroom. The user is in the bathroom now. So they need to go back to the kitchen to reach the stove. 

But the user has the half-bag of chips, so they need to go from the bathroom back to the kitchen. The bathroom has an exit to the south, which leads back to the kitchen. So the next action should be to go south from the bathroom to the kitchen, then proceed to the stove. However, the user's last action was going north to the bathroom, so the next step is to go south back to the kitchen. 

Wait, but the user's goal was to sit the chips on the stove. The stove is in the kitchen. So after getting the chips in the garden, they went through various rooms. Now, they are in the bathroom. The correct path is to go south from the bathroom to the kitchen, then go to the stove. But the user hasn't mentioned being in the kitchen yet. So the next action should be to go south from the bathroom to the kitchen. Then, once in the kitchen, they can go to the stove. 

But the user's last command was "go north" leading them to the bathroom. So the next action is to go south back to the kitchen. That makes sense. So the answer should be "go south".

So far, they've managed to open the antique trunk, get the key, unlock the bedroom door, open it, go east to the kitchen, open the screen door, go east to the backyard, then south to the garden where they picked up the chips. Then they went north back to the backyard, west to the kitchen, north to the bathroom, and south back to the kitchen.

Now, the current location is the kitchen again, with the score at 9/16. The next step according to the original plan was to sit the half-bag of chips on the stove. But in the kitchen, there's a stove mentioned. So the user needs to go to the stove, put the chips there. But the previous action was going north to the bathroom, then south back to the kitchen. So they're back in the kitchen.

The user has the half-bag of chips in their inventory. The next logical step is to go to the stove and put the chips on it. The command would be "put half of a bag of chips on stove". But the system might require the exact phrasing. Alternatively, maybe "put half of a bag of chips on the stove" or "put half of a bag of chips on stove". Since the game's previous actions used "put stuff on or in it later on", maybe the correct command is "put half of a bag of chips on stove".

But the user's last action was "go south", which brought them back to the kitchen. Now, they need to interact with the stove. So the next command should be to put the chips on the stove. Let me check the previous interactions. In the garden, they had the chips, then went back to the kitchen. So yes, now in the kitchen, they can go to the stove and put the chips there. The correct command would be "put half of a bag of chips on stove".
