Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First step, look and see that the chest drawer within the bedroom is opened. And then, recover the old key from the chest drawer inside the bedroom. And then, unlock the wooden door. Then, open the wooden door within the bedroom. And then, go east. That done, open the refrigerator within the kitchen. After that, recover the apple from the refrigerator. Then, put the apple on the stove. Got that? Good!

-= Bedroom =-
You are in a bedroom. A normal kind of place.

You can make out a closed chest drawer in the corner. Oh, great. Here's an antique trunk. You can see a king-size bed. However, the king-size bed, like an empty king-size bed, has nothing on it.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me see. The user wants me to follow the steps they outlined. So far, I've opened the chest drawer in the bedroom and found the old key. The next step was to unlock the wooden door, then open it, go east, open the fridge, get the apple, and put it on the stove.

Wait, the user mentioned unlocking the wooden door. But how do I unlock it? The key might be used here. Since I have the old key, maybe I need to use it on the door. Let me check the current location. I'm still in the bedroom, right? The wooden door leading east is closed. So the next action should be to unlock it with the key. But the game might require using the key on the door. So the command would be "unlock wooden door" or "use key on wooden door". But the user's instructions said "unlock the wooden door" as a step. So maybe the correct command is "unlock wooden door". Let me make sure. The key is in my inventory now, so using it to unlock the door makes sense. Then after unlocking, I need to open the door. So the next step is to unlock the door. Let me confirm the available actions. The door is closed, so unlocking it should be the next step. Then open it. So the next action is to unlock the wooden door.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me figure out what to do next. The user has already opened the chest drawer and found the old key. Then they tried to unlock the wooden door, but the door is fixed in place. Hmm, maybe the key doesn't work on the door? Or maybe I need to use the key on something else first.

Wait, the original goal was to unlock the wooden door. If the door is fixed, maybe I need to find another way. But the key is the only thing found so far. Maybe the key is for a different lock. Let me check the environment again. The bedroom has a closed chest drawer, a bed, and the wooden door. The key was in the chest drawer. Maybe the door has a lock that needs the key. But when I tried to unlock it, it said the door is fixed. Maybe I need to open the door first? But how?

Alternatively, maybe the key is for the chest drawer, but it's already open. Wait, the user said to recover the old key from the chest drawer. So the key is already obtained. Maybe the door is locked, and the key is needed to unlock it. But the game says the door is fixed. Maybe the key isn't working here. Or maybe there's another step I missed.

Wait, the user's original steps were: open the chest drawer, get the key, unlock the wooden door, open it, go east, then proceed to the kitchen. So after getting the key, the next step is to unlock the door. But the door is fixed. Maybe the key is for the door. Maybe I need to use the key on the door. But the game says the door is fixed. Maybe the action is to use the key on the door. Let me try that. The previous action was unlocking the door, but maybe the correct command is "use key on wooden door" or "unlock wooden door with key". But the game might require a different phrasing. Alternatively, maybe the door is locked, and the key is needed to unlock it. So the next step is to use the key on the door. Let me try that.

Okay, let me think. The user tried to use the key on the wooden door, but the game didn't recognize that as a valid command. So maybe the correct way to unlock the door is to use the "unlock" verb directly. The previous attempt was "unlock wooden door", which might have been incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the door is locked, and the key is needed to unlock it. The correct command might be "unlock wooden door" again, but the game said it's fixed. Wait, maybe the door is locked, and the key is for a different lock. Or perhaps the key is already in the inventory, so the next step is to use it on the door. But the game didn't accept "use key on wooden door". Maybe the correct command is "unlock door" without specifying "wooden", but the door is in the bedroom. Alternatively, maybe the door is locked, and the key is needed to unlock it. The user needs to try a different command. Let me check the possible actions again. The door is closed and fixed. The key is in the inventory. So the correct action is to unlock the door with the key. Maybe the command is "unlock door" or "unlock wooden door". Since the previous attempt failed, maybe the correct command is "unlock door".

Okay, let me figure this out. The user is trying to unlock the wooden door in the bedroom. They have the old key from the chest drawer. The previous attempts were "unlock wooden door" and "use key on wooden door", but the game didn't recognize those. Now the game is asking "What do you want to unlock wooden door with?" which suggests that the command is missing the object. Maybe the correct syntax is to specify the key as the tool. So instead of just "unlock wooden door", it should be "unlock wooden door with key". Let me check if that's the right format. The game might require using the key as the item to unlock the door. So the next action should be to unlock the door using the key. That makes sense because the key is the item needed to unlock it. So the command would be "unlock wooden door with key".

Okay, let me retrace the steps. The user found the old key in the chest drawer. Then tried to unlock the wooden door, but the game said they need to take the key first. Wait, but they already took the key from the chest drawer. Maybe the key isn't in their inventory yet? Or maybe the command structure is different. The previous attempt was "unlock wooden door with key", but the game said "You need to take the old key first." So perhaps the key isn't in the inventory. Wait, the user opened the chest drawer and found the key. So maybe the correct command is to take the key first, but they already did that. Or maybe the key is in the chest drawer, and they need to pick it up. Wait, the initial action was "open chest drawer", which revealed the key. So maybe the key is now in the inventory. But the game is saying they need to take it first. Maybe the command is "take old key" to pick it up. But they already did that. Hmm, maybe the key is not in the inventory. Let me check the previous steps again. The user opened the chest drawer, and the key was there. So the correct action would be to take the key. But maybe the game requires using "take" instead of "pick up". So the next step is to take the old key. But they already did that. Wait, maybe the key is still in the chest drawer, and they need to take it. So the command would be "take old key from chest drawer". But the user already opened the chest drawer. Maybe the key is now in the inventory, so the next step is to use it on the door. But the game is saying they need to take the key first. Maybe the key isn't in the inventory. So the correct action is to take the key. So the next command is "take old key".

Okay, let's see. The user has taken the old key from the chest drawer. The next step was to unlock the wooden door. But earlier attempts to unlock the door failed because the game didn't recognize the command. Now that the key is in the inventory, maybe the correct command is to use the key on the door. The previous error was trying to "unlock wooden door with key", but the game said to take the key first. Now that the key is taken, the next step is to unlock the door using the key. So the command should be "unlock wooden door with key". Let me check if that's the correct syntax. Alternatively, maybe it's "use key on wooden door". But the game might require the "unlock" verb. So the next action is to unlock the door with the key.

Okay, the user has opened the wooden door. The next step in the original plan was to go east. So after opening the door, they need to move east. The command would be "go east".

Then they need to open the refrigerator, get the apple, put it on the stove. So the next command is "go east".

You've stumbled into a normal room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be normal. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the kitchen. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You can make out a closed refrigerator. You can make out a counter. You shudder, but continue examining the counter. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. You can make out a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? The stove appears to be empty. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a kitchen island. The kitchen island is usual. On the kitchen island you make out a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the south.
