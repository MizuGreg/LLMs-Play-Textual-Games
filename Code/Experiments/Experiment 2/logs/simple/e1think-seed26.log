I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First off, open the antique trunk. After that, take the old key from the antique trunk inside the bedroom. Once you have picked up the old key, make it so that the wooden door is unlocked. After unlocking the wooden door, assure that the wooden door is opened. And then, make an attempt to go to the east. After that, look and see that the refrigerator is opened. After that, recover the lettuce from the refrigerator. If you can get your hands on the lettuce, put the lettuce on the stove. Got that? Good!

-= Bedroom =-
You arrive in a bedroom. A typical one.

You can make out a closed chest drawer. You scan the room for an antique trunk, and you find an antique trunk. You check the price tag that's still affixed to the antique trunk. Eighty bucks?! That's ridiculous! Do you know my good friend, they work for the government? I'm sure my friend could get you one of those for 45 bucks! You can see a king-size bed. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me see. The user has already opened the antique trunk and found the old key. The next step according to the task was to take the old key from the trunk. So, after opening the trunk, the immediate next action should be to take the key. The user's score increased by one, so they're on the right track.

Looking at the current room description, the wooden door leading east is closed. The next steps after taking the key are to unlock the door. But wait, the task says to unlock the wooden door first, then open it. So after taking the key, the user needs to use it to unlock the door. But how? Maybe the key is for the door. So after taking the key, the user should try to unlock the door with the key. Then, once unlocked, open the door. Then go east. Then check the refrigerator, open it, get the lettuce, put it on the stove.

But the current prompt is asking for the next action. The user has just opened the trunk and got the key. So the next step is to take the key. The user's last action was opening the trunk, so the next command should be "take old key". Then, after taking it, they need to unlock the door. But the door is closed, so maybe the key is needed to unlock it. So the next action after taking the key is to unlock the door. But the user hasn't done that yet. Wait, the task says: "make it so that the wooden door is unlocked. After unlocking the wooden door, assure that the wooden door is opened." So first unlock, then open. So after taking the key, the user should use it to unlock the door. So the next action is "take old key" from the trunk. Then, use the key to unlock the door. But the current state is that the user has the key. So the next step is to unlock the door. But how? The user needs to use the key on the door. So the command would be "unlock wooden door with old key". But maybe the game expects "unlock wooden door" and the key is in the inventory. Alternatively, maybe the key is needed to unlock the door, so after taking the key, the user can unlock the door. So the next action is to take the key, then unlock the door. But the user just took the key, so the next step is to unlock the door. Wait, the user's last action was opening the trunk, which gave them the key. Now, they need to take the key. So the next command is "take old key". Then, after that, they can unlock the door. But the user's next action is to take the key. So the answer should be "take old key".

Okay, let's see. The user has to unlock the wooden door. They already took the old key from the trunk. So the next step is to use the key to unlock the door. The instruction says to make the wooden door unlocked. So the action should be to unlock the door with the key. But in the game's context, maybe the command is just "unlock wooden door" or "use key on door". Wait, the previous actions were "open antique trunk" and "take old key". Now, the next step is to unlock the door. The key is in hand, so the next command should be to unlock the door. The user's task is to unlock it, so the correct command here is "unlock wooden door". Let me check the previous steps again. The user has the key, so using it on the door makes sense. The game's commands usually require specific actions. So the next action is to unlock the door.

Okay, let's see. The user has to follow a series of steps in the TextWorld game. So far, they've opened the antique trunk, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door. The next step according to the original task was to "assure that the wooden door is opened." Wait, the door was already unlocked. Maybe they need to open it now.

Wait, the user's last action was unlocking the door. The next step in the task was to "assure that the wooden door is opened." So maybe after unlocking, they need to open it. So the next action should be "open wooden door".

But let me check the previous steps again. The original instructions said: after unlocking, "assure that the wooden door is opened." So even though it's unlocked, maybe it's still closed, so they need to open it. So the next command should be "open wooden door".

Then, after that, they need to "make an attempt to go to the east." So after opening the door, they can go east. Then check the refrigerator, open it, get lettuce, put it on the stove.

So the next action is indeed "open wooden door".

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a typical kind of place. That is to say, you're in a kitchen.

If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a refrigerator. You can make out a counter. The counter is standard. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. This always happens, here in TextWorld! What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. Look over there! a kitchen island. On the kitchen island you can see a note. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

Okay, the user has to open the refrigerator and get the lettuce. So far, they've unlocked and opened the wooden door, then went east to the kitchen. Now, the next step is to open the refrigerator. The current location is the kitchen, and the refrigerator is mentioned as being there. So the next action should be to open the refrigerator. Let me check the previous steps again to make sure. The user was told to "look and see that the refrigerator is opened" after attempting to go east. Wait, maybe the refrigerator is already open? But the user needs to open it. Wait, the task says: after unlocking the door and opening it, go east, then look and see that the refrigerator is opened. So maybe the refrigerator is already open. But the user needs to recover the lettuce from it. So perhaps the next step is to check the refrigerator. But the user's last action was going east, so now they are in the kitchen. The description says the refrigerator is there. So the next action is to open the refrigerator. But the user's task says to "look and see that the refrigerator is opened" after going east. Maybe the refrigerator is already open, but the user needs to confirm. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to open it if it's closed. The current state in the kitchen description says the refrigerator is closed? Wait, the kitchen description says: "You can make out a refrigerator. You can make out a counter..." but doesn't specify if it's open or closed. Wait, the user's task says after going east, "look and see that the refrigerator is opened." So maybe the user needs to open it. But the game might have the refrigerator closed. So the next action is to open the refrigerator. So the answer should be "open refrigerator".

Okay, let's see. The user has to put the lettuce on the stove. So far, they've opened the antique trunk, taken the key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, gone east to the kitchen, opened the refrigerator, took the lettuce. Now they need to put the lettuce on the stove.

The current location is the kitchen. The stove is mentioned as being there. The next step should be to go to the stove. But how? The user is in the kitchen, and the stove is in the kitchen. Wait, the description says there's a stove in the kitchen. So the user needs to go to the stove and put the lettuce there.

But the available commands are to go in certain directions. The kitchen has a closed screen door east, open wooden door west, unblocked exit north, and south is unguarded. But the stove is in the kitchen, so maybe the user is already near it. Wait, the user just took the lettuce from the refrigerator. The stove is in the same room. So the next action should be to go to the stove. But the user hasn't interacted with the stove yet. So the correct command is to go to the stove. But the user can't directly go to the stove; they have to go to the location where the stove is. Wait, the stove is in the kitchen, so maybe the user is already there. Wait, the user is in the kitchen, and the stove is in the kitchen. So the user needs to put the lettuce on the stove. The command would be to put the lettuce on the stove. But in TextWorld, the command would be "put lettuce on stove". But the user has to check if the stove is accessible. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go to the stove first. But the user is already in the kitchen. So the next step is to put the lettuce on the stove. Let me check the previous steps. The user has the lettuce in hand. So the correct action is to put the lettuce on the stove. So the command is "put lettuce on stove".
