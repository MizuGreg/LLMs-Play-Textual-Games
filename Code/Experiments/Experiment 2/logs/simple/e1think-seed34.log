It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First step, open the chest drawer within the bedroom. And then, take the old key from the chest drawer in the bedroom. If you can get your hands on the old key, insert the old key into the wooden door's lock to unlock it. Then, ensure that the wooden door is open. After that, travel east. Then, open the screen door. Then, go to the east. Then, attempt to travel south. If you can manage that, lift the lettuce from the floor of the garden. And then, head north. Then, try to travel west. Following that, rest the lettuce on the stove. That's it!

-= Bedroom =-
Okay, so you're in a bedroom, cool, but is it standard? You better believe it is.

Hey, want to see a chest drawer? Look over there, a chest drawer. Oh, great. Here's an antique trunk. You see a king-size bed. The king-size bed is typical. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me see. The user is in the bedroom and just opened the chest drawer, which gave them an old key. The next step according to the instructions was to take the old key from the chest drawer. So after opening it, they need to pick it up.

Wait, the previous action was "open chest drawer", and the response was that the chest drawer reveals an old key. So the next logical step is to take the key. The user's score increased by one, so they're on track. The original goal was to get the key, unlock the door, go through, open the screen door, etc. So taking the key is the next necessary step. The user should say "take old key" now. Let me check the environment again. The chest drawer is open, and the key is inside. So the correct command is to take the key. Then, after that, insert it into the door's lock. But the next action should be taking the key. The user's last input was the action, and the system responded with the key being revealed. So the next step is to take it. The user's next command should be "take old key".

Okay, the user has been following the steps correctly. They started by opening the chest drawer in the bedroom, took the old key, and now they need to use the key to unlock the wooden door. The next step in the instructions was to insert the old key into the wooden door's lock to unlock it. So the correct action here is to use the key on the door. The user has already gathered the key, so the next logical step is to unlock the door. The response should be "use old key on wooden door" to proceed.

Okay, the user tried to use the old key on the wooden door but got an error because "use" isn't a recognized verb here. Let me think about the correct action. In text adventures, usually, you have to open something with a key. The key is a tool, so maybe the correct command is "open wooden door" after inserting the key. But the user already has the key, so perhaps the next step is to try opening the door with the key.

Wait, the previous action was taking the key. Now, the user needs to use the key to unlock the door. The correct verb here might be "unlock" instead of "use". Let me check the game's possible commands. Since the user is in the bedroom, and there's a wooden door leading east, the action should be to unlock the door with the key. So the next command should be "unlock wooden door".

Alternatively, maybe the game expects "open" as the verb. But the user tried "use" and it didn't work. So maybe "unlock" is the right term. Let me confirm. The game's previous interactions show that the user needs to insert the key into the lock to unlock it. So the correct action is "unlock wooden door".

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps to unlock the door with the old key. They took the key from the chest drawer, used it on the wooden door, and successfully unlocked it. Now, the next step according to the initial instructions was to ensure the wooden door is open. Since they just unlocked it, the door should now be open. The next action mentioned was to travel east. So the next command should be "go east" to move into the next area. The user needs to follow the sequence of actions step by step. The previous mistake was using "use old key on wooden door" which wasn't recognized, but after unlocking, the correct action is to go east. So the next command is "go east".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the steps in the TextWorld game. They started by opening the chest drawer in the bedroom, taking the old key, unlocking the wooden door, and then trying to go east. But the game responded that they need to open the wooden door first.

Wait, the user already unlocked the door with the key. Maybe "unlock" is different from "open"? In some games, you have to use a specific verb. The user tried "use old key on wooden door" which worked, but maybe "open" is the correct verb here. Or perhaps after unlocking, the door is automatically open. But the game says they have to open it first. Hmm.

The user's next action was "go east", but the game says they need to open the door first. So maybe the door is locked even after unlocking? Or maybe "unlock" and "open" are different actions. Wait, the user used "unlock wooden door" and the game said "You unlock wooden door." So the door is now unlocked. But maybe the game requires them to "open" it instead of "unlock". Let me check the previous steps.

Original instructions said: "insert the old key into the wooden door's lock to unlock it. Then, ensure that the wooden door is open." So after unlocking, they need to open it. Maybe the door is unlocked but not open yet. So the correct action here is to "open wooden door" instead of "unlock". But the user already unlocked it. Maybe the game is expecting the "open" command now. So the user's next step should be to open the door. But the user tried to go east and the game said they need to open the door first. So the correct action is to open the door. Therefore, the next command should be "open wooden door".

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps to unlock the door and open the wooden door. Now they're in the next area. The next step according to the initial instructions was to "open the screen door. Then, go to the east. Then, attempt to travel south." So after opening the wooden door and moving east, they need to open the screen door.

Wait, the current location after opening the wooden door (which was east of the bedroom) would be the next room. The user just opened the wooden door, so the next action should be to go east, but maybe there's a screen door to open first. The user's last action was opening the wooden door, so the next step is to check if there's a screen door in the new room. The prompt says to open the screen door first, then go east. But the user's last action was moving east after opening the door. Hmm, maybe the screen door is in the current room. So the next action should be to open the screen door. But the user's last action was "go east", which was incorrect because they needed to open the screen door first. Wait, the user tried to go east before opening the screen door, which was blocked. So now that the wooden door is open, they are in the next room. The next step is to open the screen door here. So the correct next action is "open screen door".

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Kitchen now. The previous steps involved opening the wooden door east from the bedroom, which led to the kitchen. The current room is the kitchen, and the user has to follow the instructions to eventually get the lettuce in the garden and then rest it on the stove.

The user's next action should be to go north, as per the instructions. The kitchen has an unblocked entranceway north.

Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game called TextWorld. The goal seems to be to follow a series of steps to reach the original goal, which is probably to collect items and navigate through the house.

So far, the player has been in the bedroom, opened the chest drawer, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door, opened the screen door, and then went east to the kitchen. Then they went north to the bathroom. Now, the current location is the bathroom, and the next step according to the initial instructions was to go east again, but the user might have taken a different path.

Looking at the current room description, the bathroom has a sink, a toilet, a bath, and a toothbrush. The player is told to try going south, but the previous action was going north. The user's last action was "go north" from the kitchen to the bathroom. Now, the next step in the original plan was to travel east, but in the bathroom, the available directions are south (from the bathroom's perspective). However, the user might need to check if there's another way to proceed.

Wait, the bathroom's description says "You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked." So the player is in the bathroom, and the only unblocked direction is south. But the original plan after the bathroom was to go east, then attempt to travel south, etc. Maybe the user is getting confused with the directions. Alternatively, maybe the player needs to go back west to the kitchen, then proceed further east.

But according to the game's current state, the player is in the bathroom. The next step should be to go south back to the kitchen. However, the original plan after the kitchen was to go north, then east, then south. But the user might have taken a wrong turn. Alternatively, maybe the player needs to go back to the kitchen and then proceed east again.

But the user's last action was "go north" to the bathroom. The next action should be to go south back to the kitchen. However, the original instructions said after the kitchen, go north, then east, then south. But perhaps the player is getting lost. Alternatively, maybe the player needs to go east from the kitchen again, but the kitchen's description says there's a closed screen door leading east and an open wooden door leading west. So from the kitchen, going east would be the next step. But the user was in the bathroom, so they need to go back to the kitchen and then proceed east again.

But the user's last action was "go north" to the bathroom. Now, the next action should be to go south back to the kitchen. But the user might not be following the original plan correctly. However, the user is supposed to follow the steps given in the initial instructions. The original plan after the kitchen was to go north, then east, then south. But the user is in the bathroom, so perhaps they need to go back to the kitchen and then proceed east again.

Alternatively, maybe the player is supposed to go east from the kitchen again. But the user is in the bathroom, so they need to go south to the kitchen. Then, from the kitchen, go east again. But the user's next action should be to go south from the bathroom to the kitchen. However, the user might not be aware of that. But according to the game's current state, the player is in the bathroom, and the only direction available is south. So the next action should be "go south" to return to the kitchen. But the user's previous action was "go north" to the bathroom, so the next step is to go back south.

But the user's next action should be "go south" to return to the kitchen. However, the user might have made a mistake in the path. But according to the game's current state, the player is in the bathroom, and the only unblocked direction is south. Therefore, the correct next action is to go south back to the kitchen.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps to explore the house. They started in the bedroom, opened the chest drawer, took the old key, unlocked the door, and moved east to the kitchen. Then they went through the screen door, ended up in the backyard, and now they're at the backyard.

The original goal was to lift the lettuce from the garden and then rest it on the stove. So far, the user has moved through several rooms but hasn't reached the garden yet. The current location is the backyard, which has a patio table, chairs, and a bbq. The next step mentioned in the original instructions was to "attempt to travel south" from the garden to lift the lettuce. However, the user is in the backyard, not the garden. 

Looking at the backyard description, there's no mention of a garden here. The user might need to go south from the backyard to reach the garden. The backyard's south entrance is unblocked, so "go south" would be the next logical step. Once in the garden, they can then lift the lettuce. 

The user's previous action was "go east" from the kitchen to the backyard. Now, from the backyard, going south would take them to the garden. After that, they can lift the lettuce and proceed as per the plan. So the correct next action is to go south.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps to explore the house. They started in the bedroom, opened the chest drawer, took the old key, unlocked the door, and moved through the kitchen, bathroom, backyard, and now the garden. The current location is the garden, where they need to lift the lettuce from the floor.

The original goal mentioned was to lift the lettuce from the floor of the garden and then rest it on the stove. So far, the user has reached the garden, which is the next step. The next action should be to pick up the lettuce. The command here would be "take lettuce" or "lift lettuce". Since the game's previous actions used "take" for the key, it's likely that "take" is the correct verb here. However, the user's previous action in the garden wasn't specified, but the prompt says to lift the lettuce. So the correct command would be "take lettuce" or "lift lettuce". Checking the game's previous interactions, when they took the key, they used "take old key". So following that pattern, "take lettuce" would be the right command. But the user's last action was "go south" leading to the garden. Now, the next step is to take the lettuce. So the answer should be "take lettuce".

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps to solve this text-based game. They started in the bedroom, opened the chest drawer, took the old key, unlocked the door, and moved through the kitchen, bathroom, backyard, and now the garden. The goal was to lift the lettuce from the garden and then rest it on the stove.

So far, the user has taken the lettuce from the floor in the garden. The next step according to the original instructions was to head north and then try to travel west. But after taking the lettuce, the next logical step would be to go north to reach the stove, which is mentioned in the kitchen. Wait, but the current location is the garden. The user needs to go back to the kitchen where the stove is. 

Looking at the previous moves, after the garden, the user was told to head north. The garden's description mentions an unguarded exit to the north, which probably leads back to the kitchen. So the next action should be to go north. Once there, they can rest the lettuce on the stove. But the user hasn't moved north yet. The last action was taking the lettuce, so the next command should be 'go north' to reach the kitchen again. Then, once in the kitchen, they can rest the lettuce on the stove. But the user's next input after taking the lettuce is to go north. Let me check the previous steps again.

Yes, the user is in the garden. The instruction after taking the lettuce was to head north. So the correct next action is 'go north' to reach the kitchen, then rest the lettuce on the stove. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next command should be 'go north'.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Backyard again after going north from the Garden. The original goal was to lift the lettuce from the garden, rest it on the stove, and then proceed. But the user just took the lettuce from the Garden and went north back to the Backyard.

Now, the next step according to the original plan was to head north after taking the lettuce. But in the Backyard, there's no stove mentioned. The stove was in the Kitchen. So maybe the user needs to go back to the Kitchen to rest the lettuce on the stove. But the current location is the Backyard. The available exits are west (screen door) and south (unguarded exit). 

Wait, the user's last action was "go north", which brought them back to the Backyard. The next step would be to find a way back to the Kitchen. The Backyard has a screen door leading west, which might lead back to the Kitchen. But in the Kitchen, there's a note on the kitchen island. However, the user needs to rest the lettuce on the stove. The stove is in the Kitchen. So the user needs to go west from the Backyard through the screen door to the Kitchen, then go to the stove.

But the current prompt says "You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked." So maybe the user needs to go south from the Backyard to the Garden again. But the user already took the lettuce from the Garden. Wait, the original plan was after taking the lettuce, go north to the Garden, then try to travel west. But maybe the user is getting confused between the Garden and Backyard.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go back to the Kitchen. But in the Backyard, the screen door is west, leading to the Kitchen. So the correct next step would be to go west through the screen door to the Kitchen. Then, in the Kitchen, rest the lettuce on the stove. But the user is currently in the Backyard. So the next action should be "go west" to reach the Kitchen. But the user's last action was "go north", which brought them back to the Backyard. The available exits are west (screen door) and south. So the user should go west to the Kitchen. But the user's previous action was "go north", and now they're in the Backyard. The next step is to go west to the Kitchen. Then, in the Kitchen, rest the lettuce on the stove. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the correct next action is to go west to the Kitchen. However, the user's last action was "go north", and the current location is the Backyard. The available exits are west (screen door) and south. So the next action should be "go west" to the Kitchen. But the user might not have considered that yet. So the answer should be "go west".

Look at that placard! What does it say? It says Welcome to the kitchen? Well that's cool. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You can see a closed refrigerator close by. You can make out a counter. The counter is typical. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You see a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well Were you looking for a kitchen island? Because look over there, it's a kitchen island. On the kitchen island you can see a note.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps to complete the game. They started in the bedroom, opened the chest drawer, took the old key, unlocked the door, and moved through various rooms. Now they're in the kitchen again.

The current goal mentioned in the instructions was to lift the lettuce from the garden and then rest it on the stove. The user just came back from the garden, took the lettuce, and is now in the kitchen. The next step according to the original plan was to head north, then travel west, and then rest the lettuce on the stove.

Wait, the user's last action was "go west" from the backyard, which brought them back to the kitchen. Now, in the kitchen, they need to place the lettuce on the stove. The stove is mentioned as being in the kitchen, but it's described as having nothing on it. So the correct action here would be to put the lettuce on the stove.

But the user has the lettuce in hand, so the next command should be to put it on the stove. Let me check the previous steps again. Yes, after taking the lettuce from the garden, they went north to the backyard, then west to the kitchen. Now, in the kitchen, the stove is present. So the next action is to rest the lettuce on the stove.
