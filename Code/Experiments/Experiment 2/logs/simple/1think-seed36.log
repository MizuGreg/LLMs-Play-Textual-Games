Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to ensure that the chest drawer is open. And then, take the old key from the chest drawer within the bedroom. And then, unlock the wooden door with the old key. Then, make it so that the wooden door is ajar. And then, attempt to go to the east. Then, open the screen door. And then, travel east. With that done, make an effort to travel south. And then, retrieve the half of a bag of chips from the floor of the garden. Then, make an attempt to move north. With that accomplished, head west. With that done, place the half of a bag of chips on the stove. Alright, thanks!

-= Bedroom =-
You've seen better bedrooms, but at least this one seems pretty normal.

You see a chest drawer. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. A closed antique trunk is nearby. You can make out a king-size bed. The king-size bed is normal. But the thing is empty.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me see. The user wants me to follow a series of steps in the TextWorld game. So far, I've opened the chest drawer and found the old key. The next step was to unlock the wooden door with the key. Since the door is closed, using the key to unlock it makes sense. I should try that. Let me check the current location again. The wooden door is leading east, and the key should be able to unlock it. So the next action should be to unlock the door with the key. Wait, but in the game, maybe the command is "use key on door" or "unlock door with key". The exact phrasing might matter. The user mentioned "unlock the wooden door with the old key", so the correct command would be "unlock wooden door with old key". But I need to make sure that's the right syntax. Alternatively, maybe "use old key on wooden door". But the previous action was "open chest drawer", which was successful. So following the user's instructions, the next step is to unlock the door. Let me proceed with that.

Okay, the user tried to unlock the door with the old key but got an error saying they need to take the key first. So the next step is to pick up the key from the chest drawer. The key was in the chest drawer, which was opened earlier. So the command should be "take old key". Then, after taking the key, they can try unlocking the door again. Let me check the previous steps again. The user opened the chest drawer, found the key, but didn't take it yet. So the correct action now is to take the key. Then proceed to unlock the door. So the next command is "take old key".

Okay, the user has taken the old key from the chest drawer. Now they need to unlock the wooden door. The previous attempt to unlock the door failed because the key wasn't taken yet, but now the key is in hand. So the next step is to unlock the door with the key. The command should be "unlock wooden door with old key". Let me make sure that's the correct syntax. Alternatively, maybe "use old key on wooden door". But according to the game's feedback, the user was told to "unlock the wooden door with the old key", so the correct command is "unlock wooden door with old key". Let's proceed with that.

Okay, the user has successfully unlocked the wooden door. The next step according to the original instructions was to make the door ajar. Since unlocking it would probably open it, maybe the door is now open. The next action mentioned was to attempt to go to the east. So the command should be "go east". Let me check if the door is open. The previous action was unlocking, so the door is likely open. So the next step is to move east. The user is in the bedroom, and the door leads east. So "go east" is the next command.

Okay, the user tried to go east but the system said they have to open the wooden door first. Wait, but they just unlocked it. Maybe "unlock" doesn't mean "open" in the game's terminology. So perhaps the correct action is "open wooden door" instead of "unlock". Let me check the previous steps. The user was told to "unlock the wooden door with the old key", but the game might require "open" instead. So maybe after unlocking, they need to open it. But the user already unlocked it, so maybe the door is unlocked but not open. So the next step is to open it. But the system's message says they have to open it first. So the correct command here is "open wooden door". Let me try that.

Okay, the user has opened the wooden door. The next step according to the original instructions was to attempt to go to the east. Since the door is now open, they should be able to go east. The previous attempt to go east was blocked because the door wasn't open, but now it's open. So the next command should be "go east". Let me make sure that's the correct action. The user is in the bedroom, and the door leads east, so moving east would take them to the next room. That's the next step.
