I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! First off, assure that the antique trunk within the bedroom is open. And then, take the old key from the antique trunk inside the bedroom. Once you have got the old key, doublecheck that the wooden door is unlocked. And then, open the wooden door. Once you have pulled open the wooden door, attempt to venture east. That done, make sure that the refrigerator is open. Then, recover the lettuce from the refrigerator in the kitchen. If you can get your hands on the lettuce, place the lettuce on the stove in the kitchen. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Bedroom =-
You've just walked into a bedroom.

You can see a chest drawer. You can see a closed antique trunk. What's that over there? It looks like it's a king-size bed. The king-size bed is ordinary. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me see. The user is in a text-based game called TextWorld. Their goal is to follow a series of steps to win. So far, they've opened the antique trunk in the bedroom and found an old key. The next step according to the instructions was to take the old key from the trunk. Then check if the wooden door is unlocked, and if so, open it. After that, go east, open the refrigerator, get the lettuce, put it on the stove, and win.

Wait, the user just opened the trunk and got the key. The next action should be to take the key. But the system message says to only output the action, like "go north". So the next step is to take the key. Let me check the current room description again. In the bedroom, after opening the trunk, the key is inside. So the next command should be "take old key". But maybe the game uses different verbs. Wait, in TextWorld, the correct command would be "take old key" or "get old key". But the user's previous action was "open antique trunk", which worked. So probably, the next step is to take the key. Then check the door. But the user's next input should be the command to take the key. So the answer is "take old key".

Okay, the user has taken the old key from the trunk. The next step according to the original instructions was to double-check that the wooden door is unlocked. But wait, the key might unlock the door. So after taking the key, the user needs to unlock the door. But how? Maybe use the key on the door. But the original steps said to "doublecheck that the wooden door is unlocked" before opening it. But if the door is locked, they need to unlock it with the key. So maybe the next action is to unlock the door with the key. But the game's commands might require "unlock wooden door" or "use old key on wooden door". Alternatively, maybe the key is for the door, so after taking it, they need to unlock the door. Let me check the previous steps again.

Original steps: After taking the key, double-check the door is unlocked. Then open it. So maybe the user needs to check if the door is unlocked. But if the door is locked, they need to use the key to unlock it. But the user has the key now. So the next action should be to unlock the door. But the correct command might be "unlock wooden door" or "use old key on wooden door". However, in TextWorld, the correct command might be "unlock wooden door" if the key is the required item. Alternatively, maybe the door is locked, and the key is needed to unlock it. So the next step is to unlock the door with the key. Therefore, the next action is "unlock wooden door".

Okay, the user has unlocked the wooden door. The next step according to the original plan was to open the door. So after unlocking, they need to open it. But wait, if the door is already unlocked, maybe they just need to push it open. The command would be "open wooden door" or "pull wooden door". But in the previous steps, the user was told to "open the wooden door" after unlocking. So the next action is to open the door. Let me check the previous messages. The user had to open the door after taking the key and unlocking it. So the next command should be "open wooden door".

Okay, the user has opened the wooden door. Now they need to venture east, as per the original instructions. So the next step is to move east. The command would be "go east" or "move east". Since the previous actions used "open" and "unlock", maybe "go east" is the correct command here. The user is now in the next room, which should be the kitchen or another area. The next steps after entering the east room are to check the refrigerator, open it, get the lettuce, put it on the stove. But the current prompt says to venture east first. So the next action is "go east".

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. A typical one. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

You see a refrigerator. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. The counter is usual. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.
