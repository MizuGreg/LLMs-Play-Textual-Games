Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to ensure that the chest drawer is open. And then, take the old key from the chest drawer within the bedroom. And then, unlock the wooden door with the old key. Then, make it so that the wooden door is ajar. And then, attempt to go to the east. Then, open the screen door. And then, travel east. With that done, make an effort to travel south. And then, retrieve the half of a bag of chips from the floor of the garden. Then, make an attempt to move north. With that accomplished, head west. With that done, place the half of a bag of chips on the stove. Alright, thanks!

-= Bedroom =-
You've seen better bedrooms, but at least this one seems pretty normal.

You see a chest drawer. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. A closed antique trunk is nearby. You can make out a king-size bed. The king-size bed is normal. But the thing is empty.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me see. The user wants me to follow a series of steps in the TextWorld game. So far, I've opened the chest drawer and found the old key. The next step was to unlock the wooden door with the key. Since the door is closed, using the key to unlock it makes sense. I should try that. Let me check the current location again. The wooden door is leading east, and the key should be able to unlock it. So the next action should be to unlock the door with the key. Wait, but in the game, maybe the command is "use key on door" or "unlock door with key". The exact phrasing might matter. The user mentioned "unlock the wooden door with the old key", so the correct command would be "unlock wooden door with old key". But I need to make sure that's the right syntax. Alternatively, maybe "use old key on wooden door". But the previous action was "open chest drawer", which was successful. So following the user's instructions, the next step is to unlock the door. Let me proceed with that.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing a text adventure game. Their goal is to follow a series of steps: open the chest drawer, take the old key from the chest, unlock the wooden door with the key, make the door ajar, go east, open the screen door, travel east again, then go south, retrieve the half-bag of chips from the garden, move north, head west, and place the chips on the stove.

So far, the user tried to unlock the wooden door with the old key, but the game responded that they need to take the key first. That makes sense because the key is in the chest drawer, which they already opened. So the next logical step is to take the old key from the chest drawer. Then, they can use it to unlock the door.

Looking at the current state: the chest drawer is open, and the old key is inside. The user's last action was trying to unlock the door before taking the key. The game's message indicates that the key hasn't been taken yet. So the correct next action is to take the key from the chest drawer. Once that's done, they can proceed to unlock the door. The user might be confused because they thought the key was already retrieved, but the game requires them to take it explicitly. So the next step is to take the key.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing a text-based game where they need to follow a series of steps to achieve a goal. So far, they've opened the chest drawer, taken the old key, and now they need to unlock the wooden door with that key.

The previous action was taking the old key from the chest drawer. The next logical step would be to use that key to unlock the wooden door. The user's instruction mentioned unlocking the wooden door with the old key. Since the key is now in the player's inventory, the next command should be to unlock the door. But the system message says to only output the action, like "go north". So the correct command here is "unlock wooden door with old key". Wait, but the user just took the key, so they need to unlock the door. The game might require the exact phrasing. Let me check the previous interactions. The user was told to "unlock the wooden door with the old key", so the correct action is to use the key on the door. The system message says to only output the action, so the answer should be "unlock wooden door with old key".

The next step according to the original instructions was to make the wooden door ajar. But since they just unlocked it, maybe that's already done. Then they need to attempt to go east. So the next action should be "go east" to move into the next room. Let me check the previous steps again.

The user was in the bedroom, unlocked the door east, and now the next step is to go east. The game's current state shows the wooden door is unlocked.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in the TextWorld game. So far, they've opened the chest drawer, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door, but then tried to go east before the door was fully open. The game responded that they need to open the wooden door first.

Wait, the previous action was unlocking the wooden door, but maybe the door isn't fully open yet. The user tried to go east, but the game says they have to open the door first. So the next logical step is to open the door. But how? The door was already unlocked. Maybe the door is locked but not open. So the correct action would be to open the wooden door. Let me check the previous messages.

Yes, the user unlocked the door, but the game says they need to open it. So the command should be "open wooden door". That makes sense. The user might have confused unlocking with opening. So the next action is to open the door. Then they can proceed east.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps to open the chest drawer, take the key, unlock the door, and now they've opened the wooden door. The next step in the original instructions was to "attempt to go to the east." But after opening the door, the user tried to go east, and the system said they need to open the wooden door first. Wait, but they just did open it. Maybe the door is now open, so going east should be possible.

Wait, the previous action was "go east" which was denied because the door wasn't open. Then the user tried to open the door, which they successfully did. Now the door is open, so going east should be allowed. The next step in the original plan was to "open the screen door" after going east. But maybe after opening the wooden door, the user is now in the next room, which might have a screen door. So the next action should be to go east to access the screen door. Alternatively, maybe the screen door is in the same room, but the user needs to go east first.

Looking back at the original instructions: after unlocking the wooden door and making it ajar, the user should "attempt to go to the east. Then, open the screen door. And then, travel east." So after opening the wooden door, the user should go east to reach the screen door. So the next action is "go east".

Looking at the kitchen description, there's a closed screen door leading east. The user needs to open that before proceeding east. So the correct next action would be to open the screen door. Then, after opening it, they can go east again. The user's previous action was "go east" which might have been incorrect because the door was closed, but after opening it, they can proceed.

The score is at 7/10, so they're doing well. The goal was to retrieve the half bag of chips from the garden, so moving south from the backyard would likely lead to the garden.

Okay, let's see. The user's goal is to complete a series of tasks in the text-based game. So far, they've opened the chest drawer, taken the old key, unlocked the door, opened the screen door, went east to the kitchen, then back to the backyard, and now they're in the garden.

The current step in the original instructions was to retrieve the half of a bag of chips from the floor of the garden. The user just arrived in the garden, and the description mentions that there's a half of a bag of chips on the floor. So the next logical action is to pick it up. 

But wait, the user's last action was "go south", which led them to the garden. Now, the prompt says to retrieve the half of a bag of chips. So the next command should be "take half of a bag of chips from floor" or something similar. However, in the game's context, the command might need to be more concise. The user has to use the exact command format the game expects. 

Looking at previous interactions, the user has been using commands like "open chest drawer", "take old key from chest drawer", "unlock wooden door with old key", etc. So for this step, the correct command would be "take half of a bag of chips from floor" or maybe just "take half of a bag of chips". But the game might require specifying the location, like "take half of a bag of chips from floor of garden". However, the current location is the garden, so maybe just "take half of a bag of chips".

But the user's instruction says to "retrieve the half of a bag of chips from the floor of the garden". Since they're already in the garden, the command would be to take it from the floor. So the next action should be "take half of a bag of chips from floor".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in this text-based game. So far, they've opened the chest drawer, taken the old key, unlocked the door, opened the screen door, went east to the backyard, then south to the garden. Now, in the garden, they need to retrieve the half of a bag of chips from the floor.

The user tried "take half of a bag of chips from floor" but got a response that says "You can't see any such thing." Hmm, that's confusing because the game description mentioned that there is a half of a bag of chips on the floor. Maybe the command isn't phrased correctly. Let me check the game's current state again.

In the Garden description, it says: "There is a half of a bag of chips, a tomato plant, a milk and a shovel on the floor." So the item is present. The user's command was to take it, but the game says it's not visible. Maybe the correct command is just "take half of a bag of chips" without specifying "from floor" since the game already indicates it's on the floor. Alternatively, maybe the game expects a different verb or structure.

Wait, in text adventures, sometimes you have to use the correct syntax. The user might need to use "take half of a bag of chips" instead of specifying the location. Let me think. The previous actions were like "take old key from chest drawer," so maybe here it's "take half of a bag of chips from floor." But the game said that's not possible. Maybe the item is already on the floor, so just taking it without specifying the location. Or maybe the game is expecting "get" instead of "take"? But the user used "take."

Alternatively, maybe the game is case-sensitive or has specific verbs. The user's last action was "take half of a bag of chips from floor," which the game rejected. So perhaps the correct command is just "take half of a bag of chips" since the game already states it's on the floor. Let me try that. The next step would be to take the item, so the correct command is "take half of a bag of chips."

Okay, let's see. The user has been following a series of steps in the text adventure game. Their goal was to open the chest drawer, get the key, unlock the door, go east, open the screen door, travel east again, then go south to the garden, pick up the half bag of chips, and then head west to the backyard, and finally place the chips on the stove.

So far, the user has successfully opened the chest drawer, taken the key, unlocked the door, gone east to the kitchen, opened the screen door, went east again to the backyard, then went south to the garden, picked up the half bag of chips, and went north back to the backyard. Now, the next step according to the original plan was to place the chips on the stove. But in the current scenario, the user is in the backyard again, and the previous action was going north from the garden to the backyard. 

Looking at the current location, the backyard has the screen door west, and the user needs to go south to get back to the garden. But the user's next action should be to go south to return to the garden where the stove is located. However, the user might have forgotten that the stove is in the kitchen or the garden. Wait, in the garden, there's a mention of a stove? Let me check the previous steps.

Wait, in the Garden scene, the user picked up the half bag of chips. The original plan was to place the chips on the stove. But where is the stove? In the Kitchen scene, there's a stove mentioned. But the user hasn't been there since they went east to the kitchen, then back to the backyard. So maybe the user needs to go back to the kitchen to place the chips on the stove. But the current location is the backyard. So the user needs to go south from the backyard to the garden, then go north to the kitchen, then place the chips on the stove. But the user's last action was going north from the garden to the backyard. So now, they need to go south back to the garden, then proceed to the kitchen.

But the user's next action is to go south from the backyard. However, the user's last action was going north from the garden to the backyard. So the current location is the backyard. The user needs to go south to return to the garden. Then, from the garden, go north to the kitchen. Then, in the kitchen, place the chips on the stove. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the correct next step is to go south from the backyard to the garden. But the user is in the backyard, so the command should be "go south". However, the user might have made a mistake in the previous steps. Alternatively, maybe the stove is in the garden. Wait, in the Garden scene, the user picked up the chips, but the stove wasn't mentioned there. The stove was in the kitchen. So the user needs to go back to the kitchen. Therefore, the correct next action is to go south from the backyard to the garden, then go north to the kitchen, then place the chips on the stove. But the user is currently in the backyard, so the next step is to go south. However, the user's last action was "go north" from the garden to the backyard, so now they need to go south back to the garden. Therefore, the next command should be "go south".

Okay, let me try to figure out what the user needs here. The original goal was to complete a series of tasks in the TextWorld game. The user has already done most of the steps: opened the chest drawer, took the key, unlocked the door, went through the doors, opened the screen door, moved east, south, retrieved the half bag of chips, and tried to move north again. Now, the current location is the Garden, and the user has to place the half bag of chips on the stove.

Wait, the last action was going north from the Backyard to the Garden again. In the Garden, the items mentioned are tomato plant, milk, and shovel. The half bag of chips was previously taken from the floor, but now it's not listed here. Maybe the user has the chip in their inventory. The next step is to place it on the stove. But the stove is in the Kitchen, right? Wait, the user is in the Garden now. How do they get to the stove?

Wait, the user's last action was going north from the Backyard to the Garden. The Garden's description says there's a tomato plant, milk, and shovel. The half bag of chips was taken earlier, so the user should have it. The stove is in the Kitchen, which is connected via the screen door (east) from the Kitchen, but the user is in the Garden now. So maybe they need to go back through the screen door to the Kitchen, then to the stove. But the user's current location is the Garden. The previous steps had them go from Garden to Backyard to Kitchen to Backyard again. So perhaps the user needs to go back to the Kitchen, then to the stove.

But the user's next action should be to place the half bag of chips on the stove. However, the stove is in the Kitchen. So the user needs to go back to the Kitchen. The current location is the Garden. The user needs to go south to the Backyard, then west through the screen door to the Kitchen. Then, in the Kitchen, there's a stove. So the correct sequence would be: go south to Backyard, then west to Kitchen, then go to the stove. But the user is in the Garden now. The user's next action should be to go south to the Backyard, then west to the Kitchen, then interact with the stove.

But the user's last action was going north to the Garden. The current prompt says that in the Garden, the items are tomato plant, milk, and shovel. The half bag of chips was taken earlier, so the user has it. The next step is to go back to the Kitchen, then place the chip on the stove. So the user needs to go south to the Backyard, then west to the Kitchen. Then, in the Kitchen, go to the stove. But the user is in the Garden now. So the next action should be to go south to the Backyard. Then, from there, go west to the Kitchen. Then, in the Kitchen, go to the stove. But the user's current location is the Garden, so the immediate next action is to go south to the Backyard. Then, from there, go west to the Kitchen. Then, in the Kitchen, place the chip on the stove.

But the user's last action was going north to the Garden. The current prompt says that in the Garden, the items are tomato plant, milk, and shovel.

But the user is in the Garden, so the first step is to go south to the Backyard. Therefore, the next action is "go south".

Okay, the user is trying to follow a series of steps in the TextWorld game. Let me recap the current situation. They've been moving through different rooms: Bedroom, Kitchen, Backyard, and now Garden. The goal was to retrieve the half bag of chips from the garden, but when they tried to take it, the game said they couldn't see it. Then they picked it up, and now they're back in the Garden.

The user's last action was "go south," but they can't go that way. So they need to find another direction. The Garden room mentions that you should try going north. The user is currently in the Garden, and the previous steps had them pick up the half bag of chips. Now, they need to move north again. The next logical step would be to go north from the Garden. The user might have gotten confused by the previous attempts, but following the hints in the environment, going north is the correct direction. So the next action should be "go north."

You arrive in a backyard. An usual kind of place.

Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a set of chairs. The set of chairs is ordinary. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You see a bbq. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. You can see a patio table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The patio table is normal. However, the patio table, like an empty patio table, has nothing on it.

There is an open screen door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in this text-based game. Their goal is to complete several tasks: open the chest drawer, take the key, unlock the door, open the screen door, go east, then south, retrieve the half-bag of chips, and place it on the stove.

So far, the user has successfully opened the chest drawer, taken the key, unlocked the door, opened the screen door, gone east to the backyard, then south back to the garden. They picked up the half-bag of chips. Now they're in the backyard again, and the next step was to go north, but that led them back to the garden. Wait, the user tried to go north from the garden, but the garden's description says to try going north, but when they did, they ended up in the backyard again. Now they're stuck in a loop between the garden and backyard.

The current location is the backyard again. The user's next action was to go north, which brought them back to the garden. But the garden's north exit is blocked? Or maybe the user is confused about the directions. The garden's description says "You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north." But when they tried to go north from the garden, they ended up in the backyard. So perhaps the correct path is to go south from the garden to the backyard, but the user is trying to go north again, which isn't working. 

Wait, the user's last action was going north from the garden, which led them back to the backyard. Now they're in the backyard again. The task was to place the half-bag of chips on the stove. The stove is in the kitchen, which they've already been to. But the user is currently in the backyard. So maybe they need to go back to the kitchen, but how?

Looking at the current location: backyard. The exits are west (screen door) and south. The user tried going south, but that's where they came from. The kitchen is east of the backyard? Wait, earlier steps: from the kitchen, they went east to the backyard. So the kitchen is west of the backyard. So to get back to the kitchen, they need to go west from the backyard. But the user is in the backyard, and the screen door is open west. So the user should go west back to the kitchen, then proceed to the stove.

But the user's last action was going north from the garden, which brought them back to the backyard. Now they're in the backyard again. The next step should be to go west to the kitchen, then go north to the stove. But the user's last action was going north, which didn't work. So maybe the correct next step is to go west from the backyard to the kitchen, then proceed to the stove. However, the user is in the backyard, so the next command should be "go west" to return to the kitchen. Then, from the kitchen, they can go north to the stove. But the user hasn't done that yet.

Wait, the user's current location is the backyard. The previous steps were: garden -> backyard (after going south from garden). Now, the user is in the backyard again. The task is to place the half-bag of chips on the stove. The stove is in the kitchen. So the user needs to go back to the kitchen, then go north to the stove. But how?

So, from the backyard, the user should go west through the screen door back to the kitchen. Then, from the kitchen, go north to the stove. But the user is in the backyard, so the next command should be "go west" to return to the kitchen. Then, once in the kitchen, they can go north to the stove. However, the user hasn't done that yet. The user's last action was going north from the garden, which led them back to the backyard. Now, they need to go west to the kitchen. So the correct next action is "go west".

But the thing is empty. You make out a stove. But the thing is empty. Look over there! a kitchen island. On the kitchen island you make out a note.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

So far, they've managed to open the chest drawer, take the key, unlock the door, open the screen door, go east to the backyard, then back to the garden where they picked up the half-bag of chips. Now they're in the kitchen again after going west from the backyard.

The current location is the kitchen. The next step in their original plan was to "make an effort to travel south" after retrieving the chips. But in the garden, when they tried to go south, they couldn't. Then they went back to the kitchen. Now, in the kitchen, they need to go south. The kitchen has an exit to the south, which is unguarded. So the next logical step is to go south from the kitchen. That would take them back to the garden, where they can then place the chips on the stove. 

Wait, but the user's last action was going west from the backyard to the kitchen. Now, in the kitchen, the available exits are east (screen door), west (wooden door), north, and south. The user needs to go south from the kitchen to reach the garden again. So the correct command here is "go south".

So far, they've managed to get to the Living Room. The current location is the Living Room, and there's a couch with a lettuce, a remote on a low table, and a TV. The exit to the north is unguarded. The user's next action should be to go north, as that's the only exit mentioned here. But wait, the original goal mentioned placing the half-bag of chips on the stove. The user had previously retrieved the chips in the Garden, but they were in the Backyard and then Garden, and now they're in the Living Room. The stove is in the Kitchen, so maybe they need to go back to the Kitchen to place the chips on the stove. However, the current available exit is north, which leads back to the Living Room's north. Wait, the Living Room's exit is north, but where does that lead? The previous locations were Bedroom, Kitchen, Backyard, Garden. Maybe the Living Room is connected to another room, but the user needs to get back to the Kitchen to place the chips on the stove. However, the user's last action was going south from the Kitchen to the Living Room. So, to get back to the Kitchen, they would need to go west from the Living Room. But the Living Room's description says there's an unguarded exit to the north. Wait, maybe the Living Room is connected to the Kitchen via the north exit? Or perhaps the north exit leads to another room. But the user's goal is to place the chips on the stove, which is in the Kitchen. So the user needs to go back to the Kitchen. However, the current location is the Living Room, and the only exit mentioned is north. Wait, the Living Room's description says "There is an unguarded exit to the north." So going north from the Living Room would take them to another room. But what's that room? The previous rooms were Bedroom, Kitchen, Backyard, Garden. Maybe the Living Room is connected to the Kitchen via the north exit? Or perhaps the north exit leads to the Bedroom? But the user was in the Living Room after going south from the Kitchen. So maybe the north exit from the Living Room leads back to the Kitchen. If that's the case, then going north would take them back to the Kitchen. Then, from the Kitchen, they can go to the stove and place the chips. But the user's current location is the Living Room, and the next action should be to go north to return to the Kitchen. However, the user's last action was going south to the Living Room, so going north would take them back to the Kitchen. Then, from the Kitchen, they can go to the stove and place the chips. But the user's score is at 9/18, and they need to complete the task of placing the chips on the stove. So the next step is to go north from the Living Room to the Kitchen, then go to the stove and place the chips. But the user's next action is to go north. However, the current prompt says "Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?" The user is at the Living Room, and the next action should be to go north to return to the Kitchen. Therefore, the correct next command is "go north".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in this text-based game. Their goal seems to be to complete a set of tasks, like opening drawers, finding keys, unlocking doors, and eventually retrieving the half-bag of chips and placing it on the stove.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Kitchen again after moving around. The previous steps involved going through the Bedroom, Kitchen, Backyard, Garden, and back to the Kitchen. The user has already taken the half-bag of chips from the Garden and is now in the Kitchen. The next step in the original instructions was to "place the half of a bag of chips on the stove." 

But in the current scene, the user is in the Kitchen, which has a stove mentioned. The user has the half-bag of chips, so the next logical step would be to place it on the stove. However, the user hasn't done that yet. The last action was "go north," which brought them back to the Kitchen. Now, they need to interact with the stove. 

The game's current state in the Kitchen mentions a stove, but it's described as "empty." The user needs to put the half-bag of chips on it. So the correct action here would be to "put half of a bag of chips on stove." But the game might require using the correct command structure. Since the user has the item, they should use the "put" command. 

Wait, but in previous steps, the user took the half-bag of chips from the floor. Now, they need to place it on the stove. The command should be "put half of a bag of chips on stove." However, the game might expect the exact phrasing. Let me check the previous interactions. 

In the Garden, the user took the half of a bag of chips from the floor. Then, they went back to the Backyard, then to the Kitchen. Now, in the Kitchen, the stove is present. So the next action is to place the item on the stove. The correct command would be "put half of a bag of chips on stove." But the user might need to use the exact wording. Alternatively, maybe "put half of a bag of chips on the stove." However, the game's previous responses have used "put" with the object and location. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to first go to the stove's location. But in the Kitchen scene, the stove is mentioned as being present. So the user can directly interact with it. Therefore, the next action should be to put the half-bag on the stove.
