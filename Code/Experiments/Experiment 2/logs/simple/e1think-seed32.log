Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, you could, like, ensure that the chest drawer inside the bedroom is open. After that, take the old key from the chest drawer inside the bedroom. After picking up the old key, unlock the wooden door. If you have unlocked the wooden door, doublecheck that the wooden door is opened. And then, head east. After that, attempt to travel south. Then, retrieve the apple from the couch within the living room. And then, take a trip north. After that, place the apple on the stove within the kitchen. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Bedroom =-
Look around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a bedroom.

You can see a chest drawer. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You make out a closed antique trunk. You can make out a king-size bed. Now why would someone leave that there? The king-size bed is ordinary. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens, here in TextWorld!

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me see. The user is in a TextWorld game and has to follow a series of steps to win. So far, they've opened the chest drawer in the bedroom and found an old key. The next step according to the instructions is to unlock the wooden door with that key.

Wait, the current location is the bedroom, and there's a closed wooden door leading east. The user has the key, so they need to use it to unlock the door. The next action should be to unlock the door. But in TextWorld, the command might be "unlock wooden door" or "use old key on wooden door". But the user has the key, so maybe just "unlock wooden door" is sufficient. Let me check the previous steps again.

The user was told to "take the old key from the chest drawer" and then "unlock the wooden door". So after getting the key, the next step is to unlock the door. The user has already opened the chest drawer and found the key. Now they need to use the key to unlock the door. The correct command here would be "unlock wooden door". But I need to make sure that the game expects that command. Since the user is in the bedroom and the door is east, maybe the command is just "unlock door" or "unlock wooden door". The previous action was "open chest drawer", so the next logical step is to use the key to unlock the door. So the next action should be "unlock wooden door".

Okay, let me figure out what to do next. The user has already opened the chest drawer and took the old key. Then they tried to unlock the wooden door, but it's fixed. Wait, the instruction said after picking up the key, unlock the wooden door. But the door is fixed. Maybe I need to use the key to unlock it. But the user tried to unlock it directly and it didn't work. So maybe the key is needed to unlock the door. Let me check the previous steps again.

The user was in the bedroom. They opened the chest drawer, found the key, took it. Then tried to unlock the wooden door, but the door is fixed. So maybe the key is required to unlock the door. But the user tried to unlock the door without using the key. So the next step should be to use the key on the door. But how? The command might be "unlock wooden door with old key" or something similar. But in the game's context, maybe the correct command is "unlock wooden door" and the key is already in inventory. Wait, the user has the key, so maybe the door can be unlocked now. But the game says the door is fixed. Maybe the key is needed to unlock it. So the next action should be to unlock the door with the key. But the user tried to unlock the door and it didn't work. So perhaps the correct command is to use the key on the door. Let me check the possible commands. The user has the key, so maybe the correct action is to unlock the door. But the door is fixed. Maybe the key is required. So the next step is to unlock the wooden door using the key. The previous action was "unlock wooden door", which didn't work. So maybe the correct command is "unlock wooden door with old key". But the game might require just "unlock wooden door" if the key is in hand. Alternatively, maybe the key is needed to unlock the door, so the user needs to use it. So the next action should be to unlock the door with the key. But the user hasn't used the key yet. So the correct command is "unlock wooden door" again, but the game might require using the key. Alternatively, maybe the key is in the chest drawer, but the user already took it. So the next step is to unlock the door with the key. Therefore, the next action should be "unlock wooden door".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in the TextWorld game. They started by opening the chest drawer in the bedroom, which they did successfully. Then they tried to unlock the wooden door, but it's fixed in place. The user has already tried unlocking it again, but it didn't work.

Hmm, the next step according to the original instructions was to unlock the wooden door after taking the old key from the chest drawer. But since the door isn't opening, maybe there's a mistake here. Wait, the user took the key from the chest drawer, so they should have the key. But the door is fixed. Maybe the key isn't the right one, or maybe they need to use it in a different way. Or perhaps the door is locked and requires the key to unlock. But the user tried to unlock it and it didn't work. Maybe they need to check if the key is in their inventory. Or maybe the door is locked from the outside, so they need to use the key to unlock it. But the game says the door is fixed, so maybe they need to try using the key again. Wait, the user tried "unlock wooden door" twice, but it didn't work. Maybe the correct action is to "use old key on wooden door" or something like that. But the game's response says the door is fixed, so maybe the key isn't the right one. Alternatively, maybe the door is locked and the key is the right one, but the user needs to try using it again. Or maybe the door is locked from the inside, so they need to find another way. Wait, the original instructions said to unlock the wooden door after taking the key. So perhaps the user needs to try using the key again. But the game's response says the door is fixed, so maybe the key is the right one, but the action is different. Maybe the correct action is to "unlock wooden door" again, but the game is not responding to it. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check if the key is in their inventory. But the user hasn't mentioned that. Wait, the user took the key from the chest drawer, so they should have it. Maybe the next step is to try using the key on the door. But the game's response says the door is fixed, so maybe the key isn't working. Alternatively, maybe the door is locked, and the key is the right one, but the user needs to try using it again. So the next action should be to try unlocking the door again, or maybe use the key on the door. But the game's response says the door is fixed, so maybe the user needs to try a different action. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check the door's state again. But according to the instructions, after unlocking the door, they need to check if it's open. But since it's not opening, maybe the user is stuck. But the original plan was to head east after unlocking the door. So perhaps the user needs to find another way. Wait, maybe the key is the right one, but the user needs to use the "use" command instead of "unlock". So the next action should be "use old key on wooden door". But the user hasn't tried that yet. So the correct next step is to try using the key on the door. But the game's response says the door is fixed, so maybe that's the correct action. So the user should try using the key on the door.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to unlock the wooden door using the old key. They tried "use old key on wooden door" but got an error. So, I need to figure out the correct command.

In TextWorld games, actions are usually verbs that match the objects. The key is in the chest drawer, and the door is closed. The previous attempt was "unlock wooden door", which didn't work. Then they tried "use old key on wooden door", which the system didn't recognize.

Maybe the correct command is "unlock door" after picking up the key. Wait, the user had to first open the chest drawer, get the key, then unlock the door. But the door was closed, so maybe the key is needed to unlock it. Alternatively, maybe the correct action is "open wooden door" but that's already tried. Or perhaps "use key on door".

Wait, the error message says "That's not a verb I recognise." So the system doesn't recognize "use old key on wooden door" as a valid action. Maybe the correct verb is "unlock" without specifying the key. But the key is necessary. Alternatively, maybe the key is in the inventory, and the action is "unlock door" with the key in hand.

Wait, the user had to first open the chest drawer, take the key. Then, they tried to unlock the door. The first attempt was "unlock wooden door", which didn't work. Then they tried "use old key on wooden door", which failed. So maybe the correct action is "unlock door" without specifying the key, but the key is already in hand. Or maybe the correct command is "open door" but that's not the case.

Alternatively, maybe the key is not the right object. Wait, the key is "old key", so maybe the correct action is "use old key on door". But the system didn't recognize that. Maybe the correct command is "unlock door" with the key in hand. Or perhaps the key is not the right object to use here. Maybe the door can be unlocked with the key, so the correct action is "unlock door" after taking the key.

Wait, the user had already taken the key from the chest drawer. So the next step is to unlock the door. The correct command might be "unlock door" without specifying the key, as the key is already in the inventory. But the system might require specifying the key. Alternatively, maybe the correct action is "open door" but that's not the case.

Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "use key on door". But the key is "old key", so maybe "use old key on door". But the system didn't recognize that. Hmm. Maybe the system expects "unlock door" with the key in hand. Let me check the previous steps again.

The user had to open the chest drawer, take the old key. Then, they tried to unlock the wooden door. The first attempt was "unlock wooden door", which didn't work. Then they tried "use old key on wooden door", which failed. So maybe the correct action is "unlock door" without the "wooden" part. Or maybe "use key on door".

Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "open door" but that's not the case. The door is closed, so unlocking is needed. Maybe the correct action is "unlock door" with the key in hand. Since the key is in the inventory, the system might accept "unlock door" as the command. Let me try that.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to unlock the wooden door in the bedroom. They already have the old key from the chest drawer. The problem is that the previous attempt to "unlock wooden door" didn't work, and the game prompted for a verb that's not recognized.

Wait, the correct action here would be to use the key on the door. But in the game's context, the command might need to be more specific. The user tried "unlock wooden door" but got an error. Then they tried "use old key on wooden door", which was rejected because the game didn't recognize "use". The next attempt was "unlock door", but the game asked what they want to unlock it with.

So the correct action is to use the key on the door. The game might expect the command "use old key on wooden door" but since that wasn't accepted, maybe the correct verb is "unlock" with the key as the object. Alternatively, maybe the game expects "unlock door with old key".

But the user tried "unlock door" and the game said "What do you want to unlock wooden door with?" So the game is expecting the user to specify the key. Therefore, the correct next action is to use the key to unlock the door. The correct command would be "unlock wooden door with old key" or similar. But since the game didn't accept "use", maybe the correct verb is "unlock" with the key as the object.

Alternatively, maybe the game expects "open wooden door" but that's not the case. The user has the key, so the correct action is to use the key to unlock the door. The correct command is probably "unlock wooden door with old key". But since the game didn't accept "use", maybe the correct verb is "unlock" with the key as the object. However, the game's response was asking what to unlock it with, so the user needs to specify the key. Therefore, the next action should be "unlock wooden door with old key".

Now, after unlocking the door, they tried to go east, but the game said they need to open the door first.

Wait, the user just unlocked the door, so maybe the door is now open. But the game says they have to open it first. Maybe the door was locked before they unlocked it.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in this text-based game. They started by opening the chest drawer in the bedroom, which they did successfully. Then they tried to unlock the wooden door, but it wasn't working at first. They realized they needed the old key, took it, and then unlocked the door. Now they've opened the door and moved east.

The next step according to the original instructions was to attempt to travel south after heading east. But the user is at the bedroom door now. Wait, after opening the door, they should be able to go east into the next room. But the game prompt says "You open wooden door." So maybe they are now in the next room. But the user's last action was "go east", which was blocked because the door wasn't open. Then they opened the door, so now they can go east.

So the next step is to go east, which would take them into the next room, perhaps the living room. Then, according to the instructions, after heading east, they need to travel south. But the user hasn't done that yet. However, the current location after opening the door is probably the living room. Wait, the original plan was: after unlocking the door and heading east, then travel south. But the user is now in the room beyond the door (probably the living room), so the next step would be to go south. But the user's last action was opening the door, so the next command should be "go east" to move into the next room. Wait, maybe the user is in the bedroom, and after opening the door, they can go east into the living room. Then, from there, they need to go south. But the user hasn't done that yet. However, the user's next action should be "go east" to move into the living room. Then, after that, they can go south. But the user's last action was opening the door, so the next step is to go east. But the user tried "go east" earlier and was told to open the door first. Now that the door is open, they can go east. So the correct next action is "go east".

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. A typical kind of place.

You can see a closed refrigerator, which looks usual, in the room. You can see a counter. The counter is ordinary. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You can make out a stove. The stove is standard. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You make out a kitchen island. The kitchen island is normal. On the kitchen island you make out a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Kitchen now. The original goal was to go through the bedroom's door, then east, then south, get the apple from the living room, take it to the kitchen stove, and place it there to win.

So far, they've opened the chest drawer, taken the old key, unlocked the door, went east into the kitchen. Now they need to go south from the kitchen. The current location is the kitchen, and the user needs to go south. The kitchen has a screen door east, open wooden door west, and unguarded north and south. The user's next step should be to go south. But the previous action was going east, so maybe they need to check the directions again. Wait, the user is in the kitchen, and the available directions are north, south, east, west. The user needs to go south from the kitchen. So the next action should be 'go south'. But the user's last action was 'go east', which led them to the kitchen. Now they need to go south. Let me check the current room description again. The kitchen has an unguarded south entrance. So the correct next step is to go south. The user's next action should be 'go south'.

-= Living Room =-
You are in a living room. An ordinary kind of place.

You can make out a couch. The couch is typical. On the couch you see an apple. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a low table. The low table is normal. On the low table you make out a remote, so there's that. You can see a tv. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a tv, go to TextWorld. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps to complete the game. They started in the bedroom, opened the chest drawer, took the old key, unlocked the door, and then went east to the kitchen. From the kitchen, they went south to the living room. Now, in the living room, they need to retrieve the apple from the couch as part of the goal.

The current location is the Living Room. The user's next step should be to pick up the apple from the couch. The instructions mention retrieving the apple from the couch within the living room. So the correct command here would be "take apple from couch" or something similar. But looking at the previous actions, the user has been using commands like "go east" and "open door", so they might be using a more direct command. However, in TextWorld, the exact phrasing is important. The apple is on the couch, so the correct action is to take the apple from the couch. The user has to make sure they use the right syntax. The previous steps showed that taking items requires specifying the item and the location. So the next action should be "take apple from couch".

Okay, the user has been following the steps correctly so far. They opened the chest drawer, took the old key, unlocked the door, and moved east to the kitchen. Then they went south to the living room, took the apple from the couch. The next step according to the original instructions was to take a trip north from the living room. Wait, the user just took the apple, so the next action should be to go north. But the living room's description says "You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north." So the correct next step is to go north. The user's last action was taking the apple, so the next command should be "go north". Then, after that, they need to place the apple on the stove in the kitchen. But first, they have to move to the kitchen. Wait, the user is currently in the living room. So after taking the apple, they need to go north to the kitchen. Wait, no, the kitchen was previously visited when they went east from the bedroom. Wait, the path is: bedroom -> east (kitchen) -> south (living room). So to get back to the kitchen, they might need to go west from the living room. But the living room's exit is north, which is unblocked. Wait, the living room's description says "You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north." So going north from the living room would take them to the kitchen? Or maybe another room? Wait, the kitchen was accessed by going east from the bedroom. Then, when in the kitchen, the user could go south back to the bedroom, but the living room is south of the kitchen? Wait, maybe the layout is:

Bedroom (start) has a door east to kitchen. Kitchen has a door west to bedroom and possibly east to another area. But when the user was in the kitchen, they went south to the living room. Wait, no, the user went from bedroom east to kitchen, then from kitchen south to living room. So the living room is south of the kitchen. Therefore, to get back to the kitchen from the living room, they would go north. So after taking the apple in the living room, the next step is to go north to the kitchen. Then, place the apple on the stove. So the next command after taking the apple is "go north". The user just took the apple, so the next action is "go north".

Okay, the user has to place the apple on the stove in the kitchen. They've already taken the apple from the couch and went north, ending up back in the kitchen. The next step is to go to the stove. But wait, the current description mentions the stove is standard and empty. The user needs to interact with the stove to place the apple there.

Looking at the previous actions, the user has been moving between rooms and interacting with objects. The key here is to find the stove and then put the apple on it. The kitchen description says the stove is present, so the command should be to go to the stove. However, the available commands might be limited. Since the user is in the kitchen, they might need to use a command like 'go to stove' or 'approach stove'. But in TextWorld, the exact phrasing matters. The correct command would be 'go to stove' to reach it, then 'put apple on stove' once there. But the user's last action was 'go north', which brought them back to the kitchen. So the next step is to go to the stove. The response should be 'go to stove'.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the instructions to place the apple on the stove in the kitchen. They took the apple from the living room and went north back to the kitchen. Now they're trying to go to the stove, but the game says they can't see any such thing.

Wait, the kitchen description mentions a stove, but maybe it's closed or not accessible. The user needs to interact with the stove. The previous steps involved opening the door and moving around. Maybe the stove is closed, so they need to open it first. Alternatively, maybe the stove is just there, and the user can place the apple on it directly. But the game's response says they can't see the stove, so perhaps they need to check the kitchen island or the note there. Or maybe the stove is part of the kitchen island. Let me check the kitchen description again.

The kitchen has a stove, but the user is at the kitchen again after going north. The stove is described as standard but empty. The user has the apple. The next step should be to place the apple on the stove. But the game says they can't see the stove. Maybe the stove is closed, so they need to open it first. But the user hasn't interacted with the stove yet. Alternatively, maybe the stove is already open, and the user just needs to put the apple on it. But the game's response says they can't see the stove. Maybe the correct action is to put the apple on the stove directly, even if it's not explicitly mentioned. Or perhaps the user needs to check the kitchen island for the stove. Wait, the kitchen island has a note. Maybe the stove is on the kitchen island. The user is at the kitchen, so they can try putting the apple on the stove. But the game says they can't see it. Maybe the correct action is to use the apple on the stove. Let me think. The user has the apple, so the next step is to place it on the stove. The correct command would be "put apple on stove" or something similar. But the game might require a different phrasing. Alternatively, maybe the stove is closed, so they need to open it first. But the user hasn't opened the stove. The previous steps involved opening the door, but not the stove. So the user needs to open the stove, then place the apple. But the game's response says they can't see the stove. Maybe the correct action is to try putting the apple on the stove regardless. Alternatively, maybe the stove is part of the kitchen island. The user is in the kitchen, so they can try "put apple on stove" even if it's not visible. The game might accept that. So the next action should be to place the apple on the stove.
