Welcome to TextWorld! Here is how to play! First thing I need you to do is to doublecheck that the antique trunk is opened. Then, recover the old key from the antique trunk inside the bedroom. Having taken the old key, insert the old key into the wooden door inside the bedroom's lock to unlock it. After that, look and see that the wooden door is ajar. And then, travel east. With that over with, ensure that the screen door is open. And then, attempt to move east. After that, make an attempt to go south. With that accomplished, lift the apple from the floor of the garden. After that, make an attempt to take a trip north. Then, go to the west. With that over with, put the apple on the stove. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Bedroom =-
You find yourself in a bedroom. An ordinary one.

Oh, great. Here's a chest drawer. You make out an antique trunk. Huh, weird. You make out a king-size bed. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me see. The user is playing this text-based game, and they've already opened the antique trunk in the bedroom, finding an old key. The next steps according to the initial instructions were to use the key to unlock the wooden door, then go east, check the screen door, move east again, then go south. After that, they needed to get an apple from the garden, take it north, go west, put it on the stove, and then stop.

So, after opening the trunk and getting the key, the next logical step is to use the key on the locked door. The user mentioned that the wooden door inside the bedroom's lock is supposed to be unlocked with the key. So the next action should be to insert the key into the door's lock. The command would be "use old key on wooden door" or something similar. But in the game's context, maybe the exact phrasing is "unlock wooden door with old key" or just "insert old key into wooden door". 

Looking back at the initial instructions, the user was told to "insert the old key into the wooden door inside the bedroom's lock to unlock it." So the correct command here is to insert the key into the door. The game's previous response was "open antique trunk", and now the next step is to use the key on the door. The user's current location is the bedroom, and the wooden door is leading east. So the next action should be to use the key on the door. The exact command might be "use old key on wooden door" or "unlock wooden door with old key". But since the game might expect a specific format, maybe "insert old key into wooden door". However, in the initial prompt, the user was told to "insert the old key into the wooden door inside the bedroom's lock to unlock it." So the correct action is to insert the key into the door. The game's previous interaction had the user open the trunk, so now they need to use the key on the door. Therefore, the next command should be "use old key on wooden door" or "insert old key into wooden door". But the game's commands might be more specific. Let me check the initial instructions again.

The user's initial instructions said: "Having taken the old key, insert the old key into the wooden door inside the bedroom's lock to unlock it." So the action is to insert the key into the door. The correct command here would be "insert old key into wooden door". However, in some text games, the command might be "use old key on wooden door". But since the user is following the exact steps given, the next action is to insert the key into the door. So the answer should be "insert old key into wooden door".

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game, and they've been following the instructions step by step. The current situation is in the bedroom, where they've opened the antique trunk and found an old key. But the game feedback says they need to take the old key first before inserting it into the wooden door.

Wait, the user just tried to insert the key into the door without taking it. So the correct action would be to first take the key from the trunk. Then, once it's in hand, they can insert it into the door's lock. The next step after taking the key would be to use it on the door. But according to the previous steps, after taking the key, they should insert it into the wooden door's lock to unlock it. Then, after unlocking, they can move east. 

So the immediate next action here is to take the old key from the trunk. The user hasn't done that yet. The game's message is a reminder that they need to take the key first. So the correct command here is to take the old key. Then, once it's in their inventory, they can proceed to insert it into the door. 

The user's previous action was trying to insert the key without taking it, which is why the game is prompting them to take it first. So the next logical step is to take the key. Then, after that, insert it into the door. So the next command should be "take old key".

Okay, let's see. The user is playing a text-based game called TextWorld. The goal is to follow a series of steps to complete tasks. So far, they've opened the antique trunk, found an old key, taken the key, and now they need to use it to unlock the wooden door in the bedroom.

The current step mentioned in the instructions was to insert the old key into the wooden door's lock to unlock it. The user just took the key, so the next logical step is to use it on the door. The game's feedback after taking the key says the score increased, so they're on the right track.

The user's next action should be to insert the key into the door. The previous attempt was to insert the key, but the game responded that the key needs to be taken first. But since the user already took the key, the correct action now is to use it on the door. So the next command should be "insert old key into wooden door" again, but maybe the game expects a different phrasing. Alternatively, maybe "use old key on wooden door" or "unlock wooden door with old key". However, based on the previous interaction where the user was told to insert the key into the door, the correct command would be "insert old key into wooden door".

Wait, in the previous step, the user tried "insert old key into wooden door" but the game said they need to take the key first. But the user already took the key, so maybe the correct action is to insert it again. The game might have a delay or require the action to be repeated. So the next action is indeed inserting the key into the door.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the steps in the TextWorld game. They started by opening the antique trunk, which they did. Then they took the old key from it. Next, they tried to insert the key into the wooden door, but the game said that can't contain things. Hmm, maybe the key isn't in the right place.

Wait, the original instructions said to insert the old key into the wooden door inside the bedroom's lock to unlock it. But maybe the key isn't in the player's inventory yet? Let me check the previous steps. The user took the old key from the trunk, so it should be in their inventory. Then, the next step was to insert it into the door. But the game responded that the door can't contain things. Maybe the action is incorrect. Maybe the key needs to be placed in the lock, not just inserted into the door. Or perhaps the door is a separate object. Let me think about the game's structure.

The user is in the bedroom, and there's a wooden door leading east. The key is taken, so the next logical step is to use it on the door. But the game's response says "That can't contain things." Maybe the key isn't in the right location. Wait, maybe the key needs to be inserted into the lock of the door, not just the door itself. The user might need to find the lock first. But the description says the wooden door is inside the bedroom's lock. So perhaps the correct action is to use the key on the door's lock. But the game's previous action was "insert old key into wooden door," which was invalid. So maybe the correct action is to use the key on the lock. But how is the lock represented? Maybe the player needs to use the key on the door's lock. Alternatively, maybe the door is a separate object. The user might need to try a different command, like "unlock wooden door" or "use old key on wooden door." But the game's previous response said that inserting the key into the door isn't possible. So maybe the correct action is to try to unlock the door with the key. Alternatively, maybe the key is supposed to be placed in the lock, which is part of the door. The user might need to try a different command, like "unlock wooden door" or "use key on door." But the game's previous action was "insert old key into wooden door," which was invalid. So the next step should be to try a different action, perhaps "unlock wooden door" or "use old key on wooden door." But the user's last action was "insert old key into wooden door," which was invalid. So the correct next step is to try using the key on the door's lock. But how is that done? Maybe the correct command is "use old key on wooden door." Alternatively, maybe the player needs to first find the lock. But according to the initial instructions, the key is inserted into the wooden door's lock. So the correct action is to try using the key on the door. But the game's response said that can't contain things. Maybe the key is not in the right place. Wait, the user took the key from the trunk, so it's in their inventory. The next step is to use it on the door. So the correct command would be "use old key on wooden door" or "unlock wooden door." But the game's previous action was "insert old key into wooden door," which was invalid. So the user needs to try a different command. The next action should be to try to unlock the door with the key. So the correct command is "unlock wooden door." But the game might require using the key on the door. Alternatively, maybe the key is supposed to be placed in the lock. So the correct action is to "use old key on wooden door." But the game's response said that can't contain things. Maybe the key is not in the right place. Alternatively, maybe the player needs to first open the door. But the user is supposed to insert the key into the lock to unlock it. So the correct action is to use the key on the door's lock. Therefore, the next action should be "use old key on wooden door." But the game might not accept that. Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "unlock wooden door" with the key. But the user has to use the key. So the next action is to try to unlock the door with the key. Therefore, the correct command is "unlock wooden door." But the game might require using the key on the door. So the user should try "use old key on wooden door." But the previous action was invalid. So the user needs to try a different command. The next action is to try to unlock the door. So the correct command is "unlock wooden door."

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game, and they've been following a set of instructions to open the antique trunk, get the old key, unlock the door, and then proceed through various steps.

So far, they've managed to open the trunk, take the key, unlock the wooden door. The next step in the original instructions was to check if the door is ajar, then travel east. But in the current state, after unlocking the door, the next logical step would be to check if the door is open. However, the user might need to move through the door first.

Wait, the game's current location is the bedroom. After unlocking the door, the user should probably try to open it or pass through. The previous action was unlocking the door, so maybe the next step is to go through the door east. But the user's next action was "go east" as per the initial instructions. However, the user might need to first confirm the door is open. But in the game's context, after unlocking, the door might automatically be open. So the next step would be to go east. But the user's last action was unlocking the door, and the score increased. Now, the next step according to the initial instructions was to "travel east" after the door is ajar. So the correct next action would be "go east".

Then they took the old key and tried to insert it into the wooden door, but the game said they needed to unlock it first. They tried unlocking the door, which worked, and then tried to go east. But the game said they had to open the wooden door first.

Wait, the wooden door was already unlocked, right? Because they used the key to unlock it. Maybe the door is locked, and after unlocking, they need to open it. Or maybe the door is just unlocked but not open. The user tried to go east, but the door is still closed. So the next step should be to open the door. But how? The key was used to unlock it, so maybe the door is now unlocked and can be opened by moving towards it. Or maybe there's another action needed. The user is at the bedroom, and the wooden door leads east. So after unlocking, they need to open the door to proceed. The game might be expecting them to open the door now. So the correct action would be to open the wooden door. But the user tried to go east directly, which was incorrect. So the next step is to open the door first.

Now they're in the kitchen, and the next step according to the original instructions was to lift the apple from the garden. But wait, the current location is the kitchen. The user mentioned moving east after opening the screen door, then trying to go south. But in the kitchen, there's a note on the kitchen island. The user needs to proceed with the tasks mentioned.

The original plan was: after unlocking the door and going east, ensure the screen door is open, then move east again. Then go south, lift the apple from the garden, take a trip north, go west, put the apple on the stove. But in the current state, the user is in the kitchen. The next step might be to check the kitchen island for the note, but the main task is to lift the apple from the garden. However, the garden isn't mentioned here. Maybe the apple is in the kitchen? Or perhaps the user needs to go to the garden via the screen door east. The screen door is closed, so they need to open it. The user's last action was going east into the kitchen, and now they need to check the screen door. Wait, the kitchen has a closed screen door leading east. So the next step would be to open that screen door, then go east to the garden where the apple is. But the user's next action should be to open the screen door. However, the user's previous action was going east, which led them to the kitchen. The current location is the kitchen, and the screen door is closed. So the next action should be to open the screen door. Then go east to the garden. Then lift the apple. Then proceed with the rest of the steps. But the user's last input was "go east" which led to the kitchen. Now, the user is in the kitchen, and the next step is to open the screen door. So the correct next action is to open the screen door.

However, in the current location (Kitchen), the user might need to check if moving east is possible. But the screen door is already open, so maybe the next step is to go east from the kitchen. Alternatively, the user might need to check other directions. Wait, the initial instructions said after opening the screen door, attempt to move east. So the next command should be "go east" again. But the user is in the kitchen now. Let me check the current room description. The kitchen has a closed screen door east, which was just opened. The other exits are west (open wooden door), south, and north. The user's last action was opening the screen door, so the next logical step is to go east into the next room.

The user needs to move south to the garden, pick up the apple, then go north, west, etc., as per the original instructions. So the next action should be to go south.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps in the game as instructed. They started in the bedroom, opened the antique trunk, took the old key, unlocked the door, and then moved east to the kitchen. Then they opened the screen door, went east to the backyard, and now they're in the garden.

The current location is the garden. The user's next step was to go south, which led them here. The garden has a tomato plant, milk, an apple, and a shovel on the floor. The original goal mentioned lifting the apple from the floor of the garden. The user hasn't done that yet.

Looking at the previous actions, the user was supposed to "lift the apple from the floor of the garden" after moving east and then going south. So the next logical step would be to pick up the apple. The command should be "take apple" or "lift apple". Since the game might use "take" as the verb, but the user's previous action was "go south", which worked. However, in the garden, the apple is on the floor, so the correct command would be to take it. The user needs to pick up the apple to proceed further. The next action should be "take apple".

Okay, let me see. The user has been following the steps in the game as described. They started in the bedroom, opened the antique trunk, took the old key, unlocked the door, and then moved east to the kitchen. Then they opened the screen door, went east to the backyard, and then south to the garden. In the garden, they took the apple.

Now, the next step according to the original instructions was to "attempt to move east" after taking the apple. But the user's last action was taking the apple, so the next action should be moving east. However, the current location is the garden. Let me check the environment again.

In the garden, the description mentions that there's an unguarded exit to the north. The user's next step was to "attempt to take a trip north" as per the original plan. Wait, the original goal mentioned after taking the apple was to "attempt to take a trip north. Then, go to the west. With that over with, put the apple on the stove."

So after taking the apple in the garden, the next step is to go north. But the user's last action was taking the apple, so the next command should be "go north". However, the user might have confused the directions. Let me check the current location again.

The garden has an unguarded exit to the north. So the correct next step is to go north. Then, after that, go west, and then put the apple on the stove. But the user's last action was taking the apple, so the immediate next action is "go north".

You find yourself in a backyard. A normal kind of place.

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a set of chairs. The set of chairs is usual. But the thing is empty. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a bbq. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You can make out a patio table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The patio table is typical. The patio table appears to be empty.

Then they opened the screen door, went east to the backyard, and now they're in the garden where they took the apple. They then went north back to the backyard.

The next step according to the original plan was to put the apple on the stove. But the current location is the backyard. The stove is in the kitchen. So the user needs to go back to the kitchen. From the backyard, they can go west through the screen door to return to the kitchen. Once there, they can go to the stove and place the apple on it. But the user hasn't mentioned going back to the kitchen yet. The last action was going north from the garden to the backyard. So the next logical step is to go west through the screen door to get back to the kitchen. Then, they can proceed to the stove. But the user's next action should be to go west from the backyard to the kitchen. Let me check the current location again. The user is in the backyard, and the screen door is open leading west. So the correct next command is "go west".

-= Kitchen =-
You've just sauntered into a kitchen.

Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a refrigerator. You make out a counter. The counter is ordinary. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You make out a stove. The stove appears to be empty. Sometimes, just sometimes, TextWorld can just be the worst. You can see a kitchen island. On the kitchen island you can see a note.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

They started in the bedroom, opened the antique trunk, took the old key, unlocked the door, and then moved east to the kitchen. Then they opened the screen door, went east to the backyard, moved south to the garden, took the apple, went north back to the backyard, west to the kitchen again.

Now, they're in the kitchen again, and the next step according to the original instructions was to put the apple on the stove. The user has the apple in their inventory since they picked it up in the garden. The stove is in the kitchen, so the next logical step is to go to the stove and place the apple there. The command should be "put apple on stove". Let me check if that's the correct action here. The kitchen has a stove mentioned, and the apple is in the player's inventory. So yes, that's the right move.
