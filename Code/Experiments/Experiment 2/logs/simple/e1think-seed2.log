You are now playing a exciting game of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First stop, assure that the chest drawer in the bedroom is wide open. And then, pick up the old key from the chest drawer inside the bedroom. Then, check that the wooden door is unlocked with the old key. After unlocking the wooden door, assure that the wooden door is wide open. After that, head east. Then, ensure that the screen door in the kitchen is open. Then, make an attempt to move east. With that accomplished, make an attempt to head south. Then, pick-up the lettuce from the floor of the garden. Then, travel north. Then, try to take a trip west. Then, rest the lettuce on the stove inside the kitchen. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Bedroom =-
You arrive in a bedroom. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You make out a chest drawer. What's that over there? It looks like it's an antique trunk. Were you looking for a king-size bed? Because look over there, it's a king-size bed. The king-size bed is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me see. The user has already opened the chest drawer in the bedroom and found the old key. The next step according to the task was to check that the wooden door is unlocked with the old key. So now, I need to use the key to unlock the door.

Wait, the current location is the bedroom, and the wooden door leading east is closed. The user has the old key, so the next action should be to unlock the door. But how do you do that in the game? The command would probably be something like "unlock door" or "use key on door". But the game might require specific syntax. Let me check the previous actions. The user first opened the chest drawer, which was the first step. Now, the next step is to use the key on the door. So the correct command here is to unlock the wooden door with the old key. The user has the key, so they need to attempt to unlock the door. The next action should be "unlock wooden door" or "use old key on wooden door". But the game might expect "unlock door" if it's the only door. Wait, the description says "closed wooden door leading east". So maybe the command is "unlock door east" or just "unlock door". But the user is in the bedroom, and the door is east. So maybe the correct command is "unlock door" since it's the only door mentioned. But the user has the key, so they need to use it. Alternatively, the game might require "use old key on wooden door". But the previous action was "open chest drawer", so the next step is to use the key on the door. Let me think. The task says "check that the wooden door is unlocked with the old key". So the action is to unlock the door with the key. Therefore, the correct command is "unlock wooden door" or "use old key on wooden door". But the game might have specific commands. Since the user has the key, they need to attempt to unlock the door. So the next action is "unlock door" or "unlock wooden door". Let me check the previous interaction. The user was in the bedroom, and the door is closed. The correct action here is to unlock the door with the key. So the next command should be "unlock door" or "use old key on wooden door". But the game might expect "unlock door" as the command. However, since the user has the key, maybe the correct command is "unlock door" because the key is in hand. So the next action is "unlock door".

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game, and they've followed the steps given. The current situation is in the bedroom. They opened the chest drawer and found an old key. Then they tried to unlock the wooden door east of the bedroom. But the door is fixed in place, meaning it's locked or somehow not unlockable. The user is now asking if they're on the right track and what their next move should be.

First, I need to recall the original task. The goal was to open the chest drawer, get the key, unlock the wooden door, open it, go east, check the kitchen screen door, etc. So far, they've done the first three steps: opened the chest, got the key, tried to unlock the door. But the door isn't unlocking. Maybe the key isn't the right one, or maybe they need to use it correctly.

Wait, the user tried to unlock the door with the key, but the door is fixed. Maybe the key is for a different lock, or maybe the door is locked from the outside. Alternatively, maybe the key is needed to open the door from the inside. But the user is in the bedroom, so the door is on the east side. If the door is locked, they might need to use the key to unlock it. But the game says the door is fixed, so perhaps it's locked. So the next step would be to try using the key on the door. But the user already tried to unlock it. Maybe they need to try opening it instead?

Alternatively, maybe the door is locked, and the key is required to unlock it. But the user tried to unlock it and it didn't work. Maybe the key isn't in the right place. Wait, the user has the key, so they need to use it on the door. The game might require the command "unlock wooden door with old key" or something similar. But the previous action was "unlock wooden door", which didn't work. So maybe the correct command is to use the key on the door. But the system might require a different phrasing.

Alternatively, maybe the door is locked, and the user needs to open it. But the key is needed to unlock it. So the next step would be to try using the key on the door. The user might need to say "use old key on wooden door" or "unlock wooden door with old key". But the previous action was "unlock wooden door", which didn't work. So perhaps the correct action is to try using the key again, but with the correct command.

Looking at the game's previous responses, when the user tried to unlock the door, the game said the door is fixed. So maybe the key isn't working. But the key was taken from the chest drawer, so it should be the right key. Maybe the door is locked from the outside, and the key is for the outside lock. But the user is inside the bedroom, so maybe they need to open the door from the inside. Wait, but the door is fixed, so maybe it's locked. The user needs to unlock it. So the next step is to try using the key to unlock the door. The correct command would be "unlock wooden door with old key" or "use old key on wooden door". But the game might require the exact command. Since the user previously tried "unlock wooden door" and it didn't work, perhaps the correct command is to use the key on the door. So the next action should be "unlock wooden door with old key".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in the TextWorld game. So far, they've opened the chest drawer and found the old key. Then they tried to unlock the wooden door, but the door was closed. Then they tried to unlock the door with the old key, but the system said they need to take the key first.

Wait, maybe they didn't pick up the key yet. Let me check the steps again. The original task was to open the chest drawer, pick up the old key from the chest, then unlock the wooden door with that key. So after opening the chest drawer and finding the key, the next step should be to pick up the key. But in the previous action, the user tried to unlock the door without picking up the key. So the mistake was trying to unlock the door before taking the key. Therefore, the correct next step is to take the old key from the chest drawer. Then, after having the key, they can try unlocking the door again. So the next action should be "take old key".

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game, and they've been following a set of steps. The current task is to unlock the wooden door with the old key. Earlier, they tried to unlock the door but forgot to take the key first. Now, they've taken the key, so the next logical step is to use it to unlock the door.

The previous action was taking the old key, so the next command should be to unlock the wooden door with the key. The system message mentioned that after unlocking, they need to ensure the door is wide open, then go east. So the immediate next step is to unlock the door. The correct command here is "unlock wooden door with old key".

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps in the game. They started by opening the chest drawer in the bedroom, which they did. Then they tried to unlock the wooden door, but there was an error because they didn't have the key. Then they picked up the old key, unlocked the door, and now the door is unlocked.

The next step in the original task was to assure that the wooden door is wide open. So after unlocking it, they need to open it. The user's last action was unlocking the door, so the next logical step is to open it. The command would be "open wooden door". Let me check if that's the correct action here. Since the door was locked and now unlocked, opening it would make it wide open as required. Then, after that, they need to head east. So after opening the door, the next step is to go east. But according to the user's previous actions, after unlocking the door, they need to open it first. So the next command should be "open wooden door".

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps in the game. They started by opening the chest drawer in the bedroom, which they did correctly. Then they tried to unlock the wooden door, but initially forgot to use the old key. After picking up the key, they unlocked the door and opened it. Now, the next step according to the original task was to head east after opening the door.

So, the current location is the bedroom, and the wooden door leading east is now open. The next action should be to move east. The user has already opened the door, so the next command should be "go east" or "move east". Since the game's previous commands used "go" for movement, like "go north", it's likely that "go east" is the correct command here. The user needs to proceed east from the bedroom. The assistant should respond with "go east" as the next action.

You arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.

You see a closed refrigerator. What's that over there? It looks like it's a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is ordinary. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. What's the point of an empty counter? You can see a stove. The stove is usual. The stove appears to be empty. You see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is standard. On the kitchen island you make out a note. Hmmm... what else, what else?

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

Wait, after picking up the lettuce, the user went north, which brought them back to the backyard. The next step in the original plan was to "try to take a trip west". So from the backyard, going west would lead back to the kitchen? Or maybe the screen door is west, so going west from the backyard would go back to the kitchen. Then, after that, the next step was to rest the lettuce on the stove in the kitchen. So the next action should be "go west" to reach the kitchen, then put the lettuce on the stove. But the user is currently in the backyard, so the next command should be "go west". But the user's last action was "go north", which brought them back to the backyard. The current location is the backyard, and the open screen door is west. So the next action is "go west". Then, once in the kitchen, they can put the lettuce on the stove. So the correct next command is "go west".

GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.

You see a closed refrigerator. What's that over there? It looks like it's a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is ordinary. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. What's the point of an empty counter? You can see a stove. The stove is usual. The stove appears to be empty. You see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is standard. On the kitchen island you make out a note. Hmmm... what else, what else?

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps in the game. They started in the bedroom, opened the chest drawer, got the old key, unlocked the door, opened it, and then went east to the kitchen. Then they opened the screen door, went east to the backyard, south to the garden, picked up the lettuce, went north back to the backyard, then west back to the kitchen.

Now, the current location is the kitchen again. The next step in the original task was to rest the lettuce on the stove inside the kitchen. So the user has the lettuce in their inventory, right? They were at the garden, picked it up, went back to the kitchen. Now they need to put it on the stove.

But in the kitchen description, the stove is mentioned as "The stove is usual. The stove appears to be empty." So the user needs to place the lettuce there. The command would be to "put lettuce on stove" or something similar. But in TextWorld, the exact command might be "put lettuce on stove" or "put lettuce on the stove". Since the user has the lettuce, they can try that action now. The previous steps have them in the kitchen, so the next action should be to put the lettuce on the stove. Let me check if there's any other step needed. The original goal was to rest the lettuce on the stove, so that's the next step. The user has already done all the prior steps, so this should be the next command.
