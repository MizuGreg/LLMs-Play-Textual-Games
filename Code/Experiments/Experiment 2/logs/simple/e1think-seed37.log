Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an exciting round of TextWorld? You do! First, it would be fantastic if you could ensure that the chest drawer is open. After that, recover the old key from the chest drawer. Then, check that the wooden door is unlocked with the old key. And then, ensure that the wooden door within the bedroom is open. And then, head east. And then, make absolutely sure that the screen door within the kitchen is wide open. After that, make an effort to go to the east. With that accomplished, make an attempt to go south. With that accomplished, lift the milk from the floor of the garden. After that, try to venture north. Then, make an attempt to travel west. With that done, rest the milk on the stove within the kitchen. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Bedroom =-
I am excited to announce that you are now in the bedroom.

You see a closed chest drawer. You can make out an antique trunk. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You can make out a king-size bed! But the thing is empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the king-size bed.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me see. The user is playing this TextWorld game, and they've already opened the chest drawer and found the old key. The next steps they needed to do were unlock the wooden door with the key, then open the door, go east, make sure the screen door in the kitchen is open, and so on.

So, the current location is the bedroom. The wooden door leading east is closed. The user has the old key, so the next logical step is to use the key to unlock the door. The prompt says to check that the wooden door is unlocked with the old key. So the action here should be to unlock the door. The command would be "unlock wooden door with old key". But in the game's context, maybe the correct command is just "unlock wooden door" since the key is already in hand. Wait, the user has the key, so they can use it to unlock the door. The game might require the exact command. Let me check the previous steps. The user was told to "check that the wooden door is unlocked with the old key." So the action is to unlock it. The correct command here is likely "unlock wooden door". The user has the key, so that should work. So the next action is to unlock the wooden door.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this TextWorld game, and they've followed a series of steps. Let me recap what's happened so far.

First, they were in the bedroom. The initial goal was to open the chest drawer, find the old key, unlock the wooden door, open it, go east, make sure the screen door in the kitchen is open, then go east again, south, pick up the milk in the garden, venture north, travel west, put the milk on the stove, and then stop. 

So far, the user has opened the chest drawer and found the old key. Then they tried to unlock the wooden door, but the door is fixed in place. The next step would be to check if the door is unlocked with the key. But since the door is fixed, maybe they need to use the key to unlock it. Wait, the user just tried to unlock the door, but the door is fixed. Maybe the key is needed to unlock it. But the key was recovered from the chest drawer. So the next logical step would be to use the key on the door. But the game's response says the door is fixed. Maybe the user needs to unlock it first. Wait, the user's previous action was "unlock wooden door", but the door is fixed. So perhaps the key is required to unlock it. So maybe the next step is to try to unlock the door with the key. But how is that done? In TextWorld, usually, you'd use the key to unlock the door. So maybe the correct action is "unlock wooden door with old key". But the user might not have specified that. Alternatively, maybe the door is locked, and the key is needed to unlock it. So the next step is to try to unlock the door with the key. But the user's last action was "unlock wooden door", which didn't work. So maybe the next action is to use the key on the door. Let me check the game's responses. The user tried to unlock the door, but the door is fixed. So perhaps the key is needed. So the next action should be to try to unlock the door with the key. But the user might have to use the correct command. The correct command would be "unlock wooden door with old key". But the user might have to use the key to unlock it. Alternatively, maybe the door is locked, and the key is needed. So the next step is to unlock the door with the key. Therefore, the next action is "unlock wooden door with old key".

So the next logical step would be to take the old key from the chest drawer. Because the key is in the chest drawer, they need to pick it up before using it to unlock the door. The user tried to unlock the door without taking the key, which is why the game prompted them to take the key first. 

Therefore, the correct action now is to take the old key. That makes sense because you can't use something unless you have it in your inventory. So the next command should be "take old key".

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text adventure game. The goal is to follow a series of steps to complete tasks. So far, they've opened the chest drawer, found the old key, and taken it. The next step mentioned in the original instructions was to check that the wooden door is unlocked with the old key. But when they tried to unlock it, the game said they needed to take the key first, which they did. Now, after taking the key, the next logical step would be to unlock the door.

Wait, the user just took the key, so the next action should be to unlock the wooden door. The game might have a command like "unlock wooden door with old key" or something similar. But in the previous attempt, the user tried "unlock wooden door" without the key, which didn't work. Now that the key is in hand, they should use it. So the correct command here is to unlock the door using the old key. Let me check the previous interactions. Yes, the user tried "unlock wooden door" before, but then realized they needed to take the key. Now that the key is taken, the next step is to unlock the door. So the next action should be "unlock wooden door with old key".

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps to open the chest drawer, get the old key, unlock the wooden door, and now the door is unlocked. The next step in the original instructions was to ensure the wooden door within the bedroom is open. Wait, but the door was already unlocked. Maybe they need to open it? But the previous action was unlocking it. Maybe the door is locked, so unlocking is the next step. Wait, the user just unlocked the door, so now the door is open. Then the next step was to head east. So after unlocking the door, the next action should be going east. Let me check the history.

The user's previous action was unlocking the wooden door, which was successful. The next step in the original plan was to "ensure that the wooden door within the bedroom is open." Since the door was just unlocked, it's probably open now. Then the next step was to "head east." So the next command should be "go east." But the user's last action was unlocking the door, and the current location is the bedroom. So after unlocking the door, the user should go east. The next action should be "go east." But the user might have to check if the door is open. However, since the door was just unlocked, it's open. So the next step is to go east. The user's next action should be "go east."

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in a text adventure game. They started by opening the chest drawer, finding an old key, unlocking the wooden door, and then trying to go east. But the game told them they need to open the wooden door first.

Wait, the user just tried to go east without opening the door. The error message says they have to open the wooden door first. So the next logical step is to open the door. But the user already tried to unlock it with the old key. Let me check the previous steps.

Earlier, the user took the old key and used it to unlock the wooden door. The game responded with "You unlock wooden door." So the door should now be open. But the user tried to go east again, and the game said they need to open the door first. That's conflicting. Maybe there's a misunderstanding. Wait, maybe the door was locked, and after unlocking, it's still closed? Or maybe the game's message is misleading.

Wait, the initial description said the wooden door was closed. Then the user tried to unlock it, which worked. So the door should be open now. But the user tried to go east, and the game said they need to open the door first. That doesn't make sense. Maybe the game's message is a trick, or perhaps there's a typo. Alternatively, maybe the door is unlocked but not open. So the correct action would be to open the door again. But why would that be necessary?

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to open the door before going east. But if the door was already unlocked, maybe it's still closed and needs to be opened. So the next step should be to open the door again. But the user already unlocked it. Hmm. Maybe the game considers unlocking and opening as different actions. So even though the user unlocked the door, it's still closed, and they need to open it. So the correct next action is to open the wooden door.

But the user's last action was trying to go east, which failed because the door wasn't open. So the next step is to open the door. But how? The user has the old key. Maybe the correct command is to open the door with the key, but since it's already unlocked, perhaps just opening it. Alternatively, maybe the door is locked and needs to be unlocked again. But the user already did that. This is confusing. The game's message says "You have to open the wooden door first." So the user needs to open it, even though they just unlocked it. Maybe the game considers unlocking and opening as separate steps. So the next action should be to open the door.

You see a closed refrigerator nearby. You can see a counter. The counter is typical. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What's the point of an empty counter?

You make out a kitchen island. The kitchen island is normal. On the kitchen island you can make out a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following a series of steps in the TextWorld game. The original goal was to perform a sequence of actions starting from the bedroom, opening the chest drawer, getting the key, unlocking the door, moving east, then handling the kitchen elements, and so on.

So far, the user has successfully opened the chest drawer, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door, opened it, and moved east into the kitchen. The current location is the kitchen, and the user's next step was to go east again. But the kitchen has a closed screen door leading east, an open wooden door west, and an exit to the north. The user was instructed to make sure the screen door is open, then go east, then south, etc.

Wait, the user's last action was "go east" from the bedroom, which led them to the kitchen. Now, in the kitchen, the screen door east is closed. The original instructions mentioned making sure the screen door within the kitchen is wide open. So the next logical step would be to open the screen door. But the user's last action was "go east", which might have been incorrect because the screen door is closed. The system responded by allowing them to proceed, but perhaps the user needs to open the screen door first before going east again.

Looking at the current state in the kitchen, the user needs to open the screen door east. The user's next action should be to open the screen door. However, the user's previous action was "go east", which might have been incorrect. The system's response after that was to show the kitchen's description, including the closed screen door. So the correct next step is to open the screen door. Then, after that, proceed east. But the user's last action was "go east", which might have been invalid because the door was closed. However, the system allowed them to proceed, perhaps because the user is supposed to open it first.

Wait, the user's last action was "go east" from the kitchen, but the screen door is closed. The system's response after that was to show the kitchen's description again. So the user needs to open the screen door first. Therefore, the correct next action is to open the screen door. Then, after it's open, go east. But the user's next action should be "open screen door" to make it open, then proceed east. However, the user's last action was "go east", which might have been incorrect. The system's response didn't mention an error, so maybe the user can proceed east even if the door is closed, but that's unlikely. The game might require the door to be open first.

So, the correct next action is to open the screen door. Then, after that, go east. But the user's last action was "go east", which might have been invalid. However, the system's response didn't indicate an error, so maybe the user is supposed to proceed. But according to the original instructions, the user needs to make sure the screen door is open. Therefore, the next action should be to open the screen door. Then, go east. So the answer here is "open screen door".

So far, the user has opened the chest drawer, found the old key, unlocked the wooden door, opened it, and moved east to the kitchen. They then opened the screen door. The current location is the kitchen, and the next step according to the initial instructions was to "make an effort to go to the east" after opening the screen door. But in the kitchen, there's a screen door leading east and an exit to the north. The user just opened the screen door, so the next logical step would be to go through it. However, the game's feedback after opening the screen door mentions an exit to the north and suggests trying to go south. But the user's next action should align with the original plan.

Wait, the original plan after opening the screen door was to "make an effort to go to the east." So after opening the screen door, the user should try to go east. But in the kitchen, the screen door is already open, so maybe the next step is to go east through that door. However, the game's current description says there's a screen door leading east and an exit to the north. So the user might need to check if going east is possible. Alternatively, the user might need to go north as per the game's hint, but the original plan says to go east after opening the screen door. The user's last action was opening the screen door, so the next action should be "go east" to follow the original instructions. But the game might have a different layout. Let me check the current room description again.

In the kitchen, the description says there's a closed refrigerator, a counter, a stove, a kitchen island, a note, a closed screen door east, an open wooden door west, and an exit to the north. The user just opened the screen door, so now the screen door is open. The next step according to the original plan was to "make an effort to go to the east." So the user should try to go east through the screen door. Therefore, the next command should be "go east."

Okay, let's see. The user has been following a series of steps to complete the game. They started in the bedroom, opened the chest drawer, found the old key, unlocked the door, and moved east to the kitchen. Then they opened the screen door and went east again to the backyard.

Now, the current location is the backyard. The next step in the original plan was to "make an effort to go to the east" after opening the screen door. But in the backyard, the user is already east of the kitchen. The backyard has an open screen door leading west back to the kitchen and an unblocked exit to the south. 

The next action according to the original instructions was to "try to venture north" after going east. But in the backyard, the possible directions are west and south. There's no north mentioned here. Wait, maybe the user is supposed to go south from the backyard. The original plan said after opening the screen door in the kitchen, go east (which they did to get to the backyard), then try to go south. But the backyard's exit to the south would lead to where? Maybe the garden or another area. 

The next step in the original instructions was to "lift the milk from the floor of the garden." So perhaps after going south from the backyard, the user would reach the garden where the milk is. So the next action should be to go south from the backyard. The user is currently in the backyard, so "go south" is the next command.

There is a milk, a half of a bag of chips, a tomato plant and a shovel on the floor.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following a series of steps in the TextWorld game. Their goal is to complete a series of tasks: open the chest drawer, get the old key, unlock the wooden door, open it, go east, make sure the screen door is open, then go east again, then south, lift the milk from the garden, and so on.

So far, they've successfully opened the chest drawer, taken the key, unlocked the door, opened the wooden door, went east to the kitchen, opened the screen door, went east again to the backyard, then went south to the garden. Now, in the garden, they need to lift the milk from the floor. The current prompt mentions that there's a milk on the floor along with other items.

The next step according to the original plan was to "lift the milk from the floor of the garden." So the correct action here is to pick up the milk. The user's last action was going south to the garden, and now they need to pick up the milk. The command should be "take milk" or "lift milk," but in the game's context, "take" is usually the command for picking up items. However, the original instruction said "lift the milk," so maybe "lift" is the correct verb here. But I need to check the game's possible commands. Since the user has been using "open," "unlock," "go," etc., perhaps "take" is the right command. Wait, in the garden, the milk is on the floor. So the correct action would be "take milk" or "lift milk." But the game might require "take" for picking up items. However, the user's previous action was "go south," and the next step is to lift the milk. The prompt says "lift the milk from the floor of the garden." So the command should be "lift milk." But I need to make sure. Alternatively, maybe "take milk." But the user's previous actions included "take old key," so "take" is possible. However, the instruction specifically says "lift," so maybe "lift" is the correct command here. But I need to check the game's possible commands. Since the user is following the exact steps given in the original problem, the next step is to lift the milk. So the correct command is "lift milk." But in the game, maybe it's "take milk." Wait, in the garden description, the milk is on the floor. So the correct action is to take it. But the original instruction says "lift the milk," so perhaps "lift" is the correct verb. However, in TextWorld, the command might be "take." But the user has been using "open," "unlock," "go," "take," etc. So in the previous step, they took the old key. So "take milk" would be the command here. But the original instruction says "lift," so maybe "lift milk." However, the game might require "take." But since the user is following the exact steps, the next action is to lift the milk. So the answer should be "lift milk." But I need to confirm. Alternatively, maybe "take milk." But the user's previous action was "take old key," so "take" is the correct command. Therefore, the next action is "take milk."

That's not a verb I recognise.

Okay, the user tried to "lift milk" but the system said that's not a recognized verb. Let me check the possible actions here. In the Garden scene, there's a milk on the floor. The correct action should be "take milk" or "pick up milk". Since "lift" isn't working, maybe "take" is the right verb. The user's previous actions involved using verbs like "open", "unlock", "take", "go", etc. So the correct command here would be "take milk" to pick up the milk from the floor. Let me make sure that's the right action. Yes, "take" is commonly used in text adventures for picking up items. So the next action should be "take milk".

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game, and they've been following a series of steps to progress. The current location is the Garden, where they picked up the milk. The next step in the original plan was to "try to venture north" after lifting the milk. 

Looking at the game's environment, the Garden has an exit to the north that's unblocked. The user's last action was taking the milk, so the next logical step would be to go north. The game's feedback after picking up the milk indicates that the score increased, so the user is on the right track.

The user's previous actions have been methodical: opening the chest drawer, finding the key, unlocking the door, moving east, opening the screen door, going east again to the backyard, then south to the garden. Now, after picking up the milk, the next step as per the original instructions was to go north. The game's current state allows movement north, so the correct command here is "go north." There's no indication of any obstacles or errors in the current setup, so the user should proceed with that action.

-= Backyard =-
You've entered a backyard. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."

You can make out a set of chairs. The set of chairs is usual. However, the set of chairs, like an empty set of chairs, has nothing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You can see a bbq. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You see a patio table. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a patio table? The patio table is standard. However, the patio table, like an empty patio table, has nothing on it.

There is an open screen door leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game, and they've been following a series of steps to complete tasks. The current location is the Backyard again after going north from the Garden. The user just picked up the milk in the Garden and now is back in the Backyard.

The original goal mentioned in the beginning was to lift the milk from the garden, rest it on the stove in the kitchen, and then do various other actions like opening doors, unlocking, etc. So far, the user has successfully opened the chest drawer, retrieved the key, unlocked the door, moved east, opened the screen door, went east to the backyard, then south to the garden, lifted the milk, and now is back in the backyard.

The next step in the original plan was to "rest the milk on the stove within the kitchen." But the user is currently in the Backyard. So the next logical step would be to go back west to the Kitchen, then rest the milk on the stove. However, the user's last action was "go north," which brought them back to the Backyard. So the next action should be to go west to return to the Kitchen.

But wait, in the Backyard description, there's an open screen door leading west. So the user can go west back to the Kitchen. Once there, they can rest the milk on the stove. The user's next action should be "go west" to reach the Kitchen again. Then, once in the Kitchen, they can rest the milk on the stove. But according to the instructions, the user should only output the next command, so the answer here is "go west."

-= Kitchen =-
You've just walked into a kitchen.

You see a closed refrigerator nearby. You can see a counter. The counter is typical. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What's the point of an empty counter? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make out a kitchen island. The kitchen island is normal. On the kitchen island you can make out a note.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following a series of steps in the TextWorld game. They started in the bedroom, opened the chest drawer, found the old key, unlocked the door, went east to the kitchen, opened the screen door, went east again to the backyard, then south to the garden where they picked up the milk. Now they're back in the kitchen after going west from the backyard.

The original goal was to go through various rooms, open doors, collect items, and eventually rest the milk on the stove. The user has already completed several steps: opened the chest drawer, retrieved the key, unlocked the door, moved through the kitchen, backyard, and garden. They picked up the milk in the garden and now are back in the kitchen.

The next logical step would be to rest the milk on the stove. The kitchen has a stove mentioned, so the user needs to go to the stove and place the milk there. Since they're currently in the kitchen, the action would be to go to the stove and then put the milk down. But the available commands are limited to actions like 'go north', 'go south', etc. However, the game might require a specific command to rest the milk. But in the previous steps, when they picked up the milk, they used 'take milk', so maybe the correct command here is 'put milk on stove' or similar. But the user's previous action was 'go west', leading them back to the kitchen. Now, they need to interact with the stove. Since the stove is part of the kitchen, the next step is to go to the stove and then put the milk there. However, the game might require the exact command. Looking at the previous interactions, when they were in the garden, they had to use 'lift milk' which was corrected to 'take milk'. So perhaps the correct command here is 'put milk on stove'. But the user's last action was 'go west', so now they are in the kitchen. The stove is in the kitchen, so the next action should be to go to the stove, but the game might have a specific command. Alternatively, since the user has the milk, they can directly put it on the stove. The correct command would be 'put milk on stove'. But I need to check if that's the correct verb. In some text adventures, you might need to 'rest' the milk on the stove. However, based on previous interactions, the user used 'take milk' and 'lift milk' was corrected. So the correct command here is 'put milk on stove'. But the user's last action was 'go west', so the next step is to 'put milk on stove'.
