I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First off, ensure that the antique trunk within the bedroom is open. After that, recover the old key from the antique trunk. After that, make it so that the wooden door in the bedroom is unlocked with the old key. And then, make absolutely sure that the wooden door inside the bedroom is ajar. After opening the wooden door, go east. Then, doublecheck that the screen door is wide open. And then, attempt to travel east. And then, try to travel south. With that done, lift the milk from the floor of the garden. After stealing the milk, head north. And then, attempt to travel west. With that done, rest the milk on the stove. That's it!

-= Bedroom =-
I am sorry to announce that you are now in the bedroom. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a chest drawer. You scan the room for an antique trunk, and you find an antique trunk. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to a king-size bed. The king-size bed is standard. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. You think about smashing the king-size bed to bits, throwing the bits in the dump, etc, until you get bored.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me see. The user has already opened the antique trunk and found the old key. The next step according to the task was to unlock the wooden door in the bedroom with the old key. So I need to use the key on the door.

Wait, the current room is the bedroom, and there's a closed wooden door leading east. The task says to make the door unlocked with the old key. So the action should be to unlock the door with the key. But how is that done in the game? Usually, you'd use the key to unlock a door. So the command would be something like "unlock wooden door with old key" or "use old key on wooden door".

But the game might expect a specific syntax. Let me check the previous actions. The user first opened the antique trunk, which was the first step. Then the system responded with the old key. Now, the next step is to unlock the door. So the correct command here is to unlock the door using the key. So the next action should be "unlock wooden door with old key". But maybe the game uses "use" instead of "unlock". Alternatively, maybe it's "open wooden door with old key". But since the door is closed, unlocking it would be the right action. Let me make sure. The task says "make it so that the wooden door in the bedroom is unlocked with the old key". So the action is to unlock the door using the key. Therefore, the correct command is "unlock wooden door with old key".

<think>
Okay, let me figure out what to do next. The user tried to unlock the wooden door with the old key, but the system said they need to take the old key first. Wait, but the old key was already retrieved from the antique trunk. Let me check the previous steps.

Earlier, the user opened the antique trunk and found the old key. So the key is in their inventory. Maybe the command was incorrect. The correct action would be to use the key on the door. Maybe the right command is "use old key on wooden door" or "unlock wooden door with old key". But the system said "you need to take the old key first", which suggests that the key wasn't in the inventory. Wait, maybe the key is in the trunk, and the user hasn't picked it up yet. Oh, right! When you open the trunk, you find the key, but you have to take it. So the user might have just opened the trunk but not taken the key. So the next step is to take the old key from the trunk. Wait, but the trunk was already opened, and the key was revealed. So maybe the user didn't pick it up. So the correct action is to take the old key first. Then, unlock the door. But the user's previous action was trying to unlock the door without taking the key. So the system is pointing out that the key hasn't been taken yet. Therefore, the next action should be to take the old key from the trunk. But where is the trunk? The trunk is in the bedroom, opened. So the command would be "take old key from antique trunk". Then, after taking the key, unlock the door. But the user's last action was trying to unlock the door without the key. So the system is saying that the key hasn't been taken yet. Therefore, the next step is to take the key. So the correct command is "take old key from antique trunk".

Okay, let me recap. The user has taken the old key from the antique trunk. The next step according to the original task was to unlock the wooden door in the bedroom with the old key. So now that the key is in hand, the next action should be to unlock the door. The command would be something like "unlock wooden door with old key" or "use old key on wooden door". Since the game might expect a specific syntax, I'll check previous interactions. Earlier, when the user tried to unlock the door without the key, the system said they needed to take the key first. Now that the key is taken, the correct command is to unlock the door using the key. So the next action is to unlock the wooden door with the old key.

Alternatively, maybe the game uses "open" instead of "unlock", but since the door is closed, unlocking it would be the right action. So the command should be "unlock wooden door with old key".

Okay, let's see. The user has successfully unlocked the wooden door. The next step in the original task was to make sure the door is ajar. So after unlocking, they need to check if it's open. But how is that done in the game? Maybe the command is "open wooden door" or "push wooden door". But since it's already unlocked, perhaps the door is now open. Wait, the task says "make absolutely sure that the wooden door inside the bedroom is ajar". So maybe the user needs to open it fully. Alternatively, maybe the door is unlocked but not open, so they need to push it open. But the game might have a specific command. The previous action was unlocking, so the next step is to open it. So the command would be "open wooden door". Let me check the previous steps. After unlocking, the user should open the door. So the next action is "open wooden door".

You can see a closed refrigerator in the room. You can make out a counter. The counter is usual. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. You scan the room, seeing a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. You can see a kitchen island. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? On the kitchen island you can see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Okay, let's see. The user just moved east into the Kitchen. The next steps according to the original task were: after opening the wooden door in the bedroom, go east, then double-check the screen door is open, then travel east again, then try south. But wait, the current room is the Kitchen. Let me check the task again.

The original task said: After opening the wooden door (in the bedroom), go east. Then double-check the screen door is wide open. Then travel east again. Then try south. Then lift milk from the garden, etc.

Wait, the user is now in the Kitchen. The screen door leading east is closed. The task says to double-check that the screen door is wide open. So the next action should be to open the screen door. But how? The command would be "open screen door". But the screen door is leading east. So the user needs to open it. Then, after that, travel east again. So the next step is to open the screen door.

Okay, the user tried to take the milk from the floor but couldn't. Let me check the current room again. The Garden has a milk, a half of a bag of chips, a lettuce, and a shovel on the floor. So the milk is present. Maybe the command should be "take milk" without specifying the floor, but the game might require specifying the location. Alternatively, maybe the milk is in a different place. Wait, the user is in the Garden, and the milk is on the floor. So the correct command is "take milk from floor". But the system said "you can't see any such thing". That's confusing because the description says the milk is on the floor. Maybe there's a typo or a misunderstanding. Alternatively, maybe the milk is not visible yet. Wait, the user's previous action was "take milk from floor", and the system responded that it can't see it. But according to the room description, the milk is there. Maybe the game expects a different command. Perhaps "pick up milk" or "get milk". Alternatively, maybe the milk is in a container. But the description says it's on the floor. Hmm. Maybe the correct command is "take milk". Let me try that. If the system allows it, then proceed. But the user has to follow the exact command. Since the system said "can't see any such thing", maybe the milk is not visible. Wait, the room description says "a milk, a half of a bag of chips, a lettuce and a shovel on the floor."

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

I think I might be going in circles. Let me try to focus on the original task. The next step was to rest the milk on the stove. So I need to go to the stove and put the milk there. The stove is in the kitchen, so the command should be "go to stove" or "go to stove". Let me try that.
</think>go to stove

You can't see any such thing.

I need to find the stove. Let me try "look around" to see if I can spot it.

I only understood you as far as wanting to take inventory.

Okay, the user is in the Kitchen and needs to rest the milk on the stove. They tried "go to stove" but got a response that it wasn't visible. Then they tried "look around" but got a different response. Now, they need to figure out how to interact with the stove.

First, the task is to rest the milk on the stove. So the milk is already in the user's inventory (since they picked it up earlier). The next step is to place it on the stove. But how is that done in the game? Possible commands could be "put milk on stove" or "rest milk on stove". Since the game might expect a specific phrasing, "put milk on stove" is more likely. Let me check previous interactions. The user had to "take milk from floor" before, so "put" is the correct verb here. Therefore, the next action should be "put milk on stove".
