Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, try to travel east. Then, travel east. With that over with, venture north. Then, pick up the cucumber from the floor of the lounge. Got that? Good!

-= Basement =-
You've come into a typical room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be typical. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the basement. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked.

>                                                                                                                                -= Basement =-0/1

-= Sauna =-
You've just sauntered into a sauna.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.



>                                                                                                                                -= Sauna =-0/2

Okay, let's see. The user is playing a text adventure game. The initial task was to go east twice, then north, and pick up the cucumber in the lounge. So far, they started in the basement, went east to the sauna. Now they're in the sauna. The next step according to the original plan was to go east again, but the sauna has exits to east, north, and west. Wait, the user's task was to go east twice. First, from basement to sauna (east once). Then, from sauna, go east again? But the sauna's east exit is unguarded. But maybe that's part of the path. However, the original goal was to get to the lounge and pick up the cucumber. Maybe the sauna is part of the path towards the lounge. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go north from the sauna. But the original instructions said after going east twice, go north. So after the first east (basement to sauna), the second east would be from sauna to east. But the user is now in the sauna. So the next action should be to go east again, as per the original plan. But the user is asking if they're on the right track. The user is in the sauna, so going east again would be the next step. Alternatively, maybe the user should go north from the sauna. But the original plan was to go east twice, then north. So after the first east (basement to sauna), the second east would be from sauna to east. Then, after that, go north. But the user is now in the sauna. So the next action should be to go east again. But the user is asking if they're making the right moves. The answer is yes, because they're following the plan: east, east, north. So the next action is go east.

-= Kitchenette =-
You arrive in a kitchenette.



There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an unblocked exit to the west.



>                                                                                                                                -= Kitchenette =-0/3

Okay, let's see. The user is in a text adventure game. Their goal is to pick up the cucumber from the lounge and put it in a place. So far, they've gone east from the basement into the sauna, then east again into the kitchenette. Now, they're in the kitchenette, which has exits to the north and west.

The original task was to first travel east twice, then north, and then pick up the cucumber. The user has already done the first two steps: east from basement to sauna, then east again to kitchenette. Now they need to go north from the kitchenette. The next step in the original plan was to venture north. So the correct action here would be to go north. The user is following the initial instructions, so continuing with north makes sense. The kitchenette's north exit is unblocked, so that's a valid move. The user should proceed north to continue towards the lounge where the cucumber is. The answer should be "go north".
</think>go north
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Lounge =-
You are in an ordinary kind of place. That is to say, you're in a lounge.



There is an unblocked exit to the south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

There is a cucumber on the floor.


>                                                                                                                                -= Lounge =-0/4

So far, they've gone from the basement to the sauna, then to the kitchenette, and now they're in the lounge. Wait, the original instructions said after traveling east twice and then north, they should be in the lounge. So maybe that's the right path.

Now, in the lounge, there's a cucumber on the floor. The next step is to pick it up. The user's last action was going north, which led them to the lounge. So the next command should be to pick up the cucumber. Let me check the previous steps again to make sure. The user had to go east, east, then north. The basement -> sauna (east), sauna -> kitchenette (east), kitchenette -> lounge (north). Yes, that's correct. So now in the lounge, the cucumber is there. The command should be "pick up cucumber".
</think>pick up cucumber
