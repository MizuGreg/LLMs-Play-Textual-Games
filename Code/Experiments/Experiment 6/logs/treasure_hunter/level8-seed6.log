Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, try to travel east. Then, travel east. With that over with, venture north. Then, pick up the cucumber from the floor of the lounge. Got that? Good!

-= Basement =-
You've come into a typical room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be typical. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the basement. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is in a text adventure game where they've been moving between the Basement and Sauna. The original task was to travel east twice, then north, and pick up the cucumber from the lounge.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Basement again after moving back and forth between the Sauna and Basement multiple times. The key is to follow the initial instructions: go east, then east again, then north, and pick up the cucumber. 

But the user has been going east and west repeatedly, which might be a loop. The problem is that the Sauna and Basement are probably connected, so moving east from the Basement takes you to the Sauna, and west takes you back. But the original goal was to go east twice, then north. So maybe after the first two easts, they need to go north from the Sauna. However, the user is stuck in a loop between the two rooms. 

Wait, the initial instructions said after traveling east twice, venture north. So perhaps after the second east, they are in the Sauna, then going north from there. But the user hasn't reached that point yet. The current position is in the Basement again, so maybe they need to go east again to get to the Sauna, then north. But the user is getting confused by the back and forth.

The user's next action should be to go north from the Sauna once they are there. But since they are currently in the Basement, they need to go east to the Sauna, then north. However, the user has been going west and east repeatedly, so maybe they need to break the loop and proceed to the Sauna, then go north. The next step is to go east again to reach the Sauna, then north. But the user's last action was going west, so the next move should be east to get to the Sauna. Then, from the Sauna, go north. Once there, they can look for the cucumber in the lounge. But the task mentions the cucumber is in the lounge, so maybe after going north from the Sauna, they enter the lounge and pick it up. So the next action is to go east again to reach the Sauna, then north to the lounge. But the user is currently in the Basement, so the next move is east.
