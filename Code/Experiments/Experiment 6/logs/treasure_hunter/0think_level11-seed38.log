Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. Your first objective is to venture east. And then, pick-up the passkey from the floor of the office. Alright, thanks!

-= Vault =-
You've seen better vaults, but at least this one seems pretty ordinary.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

-= Office =-
You've just sauntered into an office.

You can make out a coffer. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a chair. There's something about an object in a room that's just so... TextWorld. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a chair in a room.

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

There is a passkey and a latchkey on the floor.
