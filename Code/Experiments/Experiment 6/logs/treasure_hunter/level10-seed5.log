Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First off, head north. After that, try to go to the east. If you can finish that, take a trip south. Then, make an attempt to go to the east. After that, pick-up the fondue from the floor of the cookhouse. Got that? Good!

-= Bedroom =-
You've entered a bedroom.



There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Kitchenette =-
You arrive in a kitchenette. An ordinary kind of place. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

-= Study =-
You've just sauntered into a study.



There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

There is a disk on the floor.

-= Chamber =-
You're now in the chamber. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.



>                                                                                                                                -= Chamber =-0/4
