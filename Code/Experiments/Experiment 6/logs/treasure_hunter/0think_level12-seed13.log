-= Chamber =-
You're now in the chamber. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

There is a sandwich on the floor.
