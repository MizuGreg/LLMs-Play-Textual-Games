It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First of all, attempt to travel west. If you can accomplish that, go to the south. And then, recover the sponge from the floor of the sauna. That's it!

-= Cubicle =-
You've entered a cubicle. Let's see what's in here.



There is an open door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

-= Dish-Pit =-
You find yourself in a dish-pit. A normal one. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a case. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You see an opened chest nearby. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this?

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.
