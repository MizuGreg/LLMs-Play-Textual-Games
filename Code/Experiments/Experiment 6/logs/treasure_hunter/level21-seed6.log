You've entered a kitchen. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a table. You see a sandwich on the table.

There is an open stone hatch leading east. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.
