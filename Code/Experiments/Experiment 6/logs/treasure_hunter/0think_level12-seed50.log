Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an fast paced round of TextWorld? You do! Here is your task for today. First stop, move east. And then, venture south. With that accomplished, recover the peanut from the floor of the laundromat. Alright, thanks!

-= Office =-
You are in an office. A standard kind of place. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You can make out a locked safe, which looks normal, nearby.

There is an open stone door leading east. There is an open gate leading south.

AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go east
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Launderette =-
Of every launderette you could have walked into, you had to walk into a normal one. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a bench. However, the bench, like an empty bench, has nothing on it. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset.

There is an open stone door leading west. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go south
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Laundromat =-
You find yourself in a laundromat. A typical kind of place. The room is well lit.

You can make out a shelf. The shelf is typical. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a peanut on the floor.
