Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First, it would be fantastic if you could make an attempt to go to the east. And then, try to head north. With that over with, retrieve the teapot from the floor of the canteen. That's it!

-= Basement =-
You arrive in a basement. An ordinary kind of place.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they need to retrieve a teapot from the canteen's floor. So far, they've gone east from the basement into a sauna. The current location is the sauna, and the possible directions are north and west.

The user's previous action was "go east", which took them from the basement to the sauna. Now, they're in the sauna. The next step is to figure out the correct path to reach the canteen's floor where the teapot is. The user's goal is to get the teapot, so I need to think about how to get there from the sauna.

The sauna has an unguarded entrance to the north and west. The user's previous actions were going east, then maybe they need to go north or west. But the user's next action is to decide between those. The user is asking if they're on the right track and what their next move should be.

In the basement, the exit to the east led to the sauna. The sauna's north and west exits are unguarded. The original goal is to get to the canteen's floor. The canteen is probably a different room. Maybe the sauna is part of the basement, and the canteen is another area. But how to get there?

The user needs to get to the canteen's floor. So perhaps from the sauna, going north or west might lead to other areas. But the user hasn't found the canteen yet. The user's previous steps were going east, then maybe they need to go north or west from the sauna. However, the user is in the sauna now. The problem is that the user hasn't found the canteen yet, so they need to explore.

But the user's next action is to decide between north or west. The user is asking if they're on the right track. The user's initial instructions were to go east, then north, then retrieve the teapot. But maybe the correct path is different. Alternatively, maybe the canteen is connected through another path.

Alternatively, maybe the user is in the sauna, and the correct path is to go west to get back to the basement, then find another exit. But the basement had an exit to the west. However, the user is in the sauna now. So from the sauna, going west might take them back to the basement, then perhaps to the canteen.

But the user's original plan was to go east, then north. But in the sauna, the user is in a different location. So maybe the correct path is to go north from the sauna. But the user needs to figure out where the canteen is.

Alternatively, maybe the canteen is in the basement. But the user is in the sauna now. So perhaps the user needs to go back to the basement, then find the way to the canteen.

But the user's next action is to decide between north or west. The user is asking if they're on the right track. The user's initial plan was to go east, then north. But in the sauna, going north might lead to another area. However, the user needs to get to the canteen's floor. So perhaps the correct path is to go west from the sauna to return to the basement, then proceed to the canteen.

But the user is in the sauna. So the next step would be to go west to return to the basement. Then, from the basement, maybe go north or south to reach the canteen. However, the user's initial instruction was to go east, then north. But that might not be the correct path.

Alternatively, maybe the canteen is in the sauna. But the user's goal is to retrieve the teapot from the canteen's floor. So the user needs to get to the canteen's floor. If the user is in the sauna, perhaps the canteen is connected through another path.

But the user is in the sauna, and the possible directions are north and west. The user needs to find the correct path. The user's next action should be to go west to return to the basement, then proceed to the canteen. But the user is asking if they're on the right track. The user's previous action was going east, which led them to the sauna. Now, from the sauna, going west would take them back to the basement. Then, from the basement, maybe they can go north or south to reach the canteen.

Alternatively, maybe the canteen is in the north direction from the sauna. But the user hasn't explored that yet. However, the user's initial plan was to go north after going east. But in the sauna, going north is an option. However, the user is in the sauna, and the canteen is probably not there.

So, considering all that, the next action should be to go west from the sauna to return to the basement, then proceed to the canteen. Therefore, the user's next action is to go west.

-= Basement =-
You arrive in a basement. An ordinary kind of place.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in a text-based game. Their goal is to retrieve the teapot from the canteen's floor. So far, they've gone east from the basement into a sauna, then west back to the basement.

Hmm, the current room is the basement again. The exits here are east, south, and west. The user's previous actions were going east and then west, which brought them back. They might be getting confused between the rooms. The original goal is to get to the canteen's floor, so maybe the basement is part of the path there.

Wait, the user's first instruction was to go east, then north, and retrieve the teapot. But in the sauna, the options were north and west. They went west back to the basement. Now, in the basement, they need to find the right direction towards the canteen. The basement has an exit to the east, which they previously used. Maybe the canteen is through another exit, like south or west? But the west exit is unguarded. Alternatively, maybe the canteen is in a different part of the basement.

The user needs to find the teapot in the canteen. So perhaps they need to go through the east exit from the basement to get to the canteen. But the sauna was east of the basement. Wait, maybe the canteen is connected via another path. Alternatively, maybe the user is going in circles. Let me check the rooms again.

Original path: basement (east to sauna), then west back to basement. Now, in the basement, the exits are east (sauna), south (unblocked), and west (unguarded). The user needs to get to the canteen. Maybe the canteen is accessible from the south exit of the basement? Or perhaps the west exit leads to another area. But the user's goal is the canteen's floor. Maybe the canteen is in the basement, and the teapot is on the floor here. Wait, the original instruction said "retrieve the teapot from the floor of the canteen." So the canteen is a room, and the teapot is there. But the user is currently in the basement. So they need to find the path to the canteen.

Perhaps the canteen is connected via the south exit of the basement. The user should try going south from the basement to reach the canteen. Alternatively, maybe the east exit leads to the sauna, which isn't helpful. So the next logical step is to go south from the basement to reach the canteen. That makes sense. So the next action should be 'go south'.

-= Spare Room =-
You've entered a spare room. The room is well lit.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in this text-based game. Their goal is to retrieve the teapot from the canteen's floor. So far, they've gone from the basement to the sauna, then back to the basement, and now into a spare room.

The current room is the Spare Room, which is well lit. The hint here says, "You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north." Wait, but the user is in the Spare Room. The previous rooms they've visited were basement, sauna, and now spare room. The original goal was to get to the canteen's floor to retrieve the teapot. 

But the user hasn't mentioned the canteen yet. Maybe the path requires moving through different rooms. The current room is the Spare Room. The instruction says to try going north. So the next step would be to go north from the Spare Room. 

But I need to check if there's any other clue. The user's previous actions were going east, west, south, and now maybe north. The game's environment seems to have interconnected rooms. The key is to find the path that leads to the canteen. Since the original instruction mentioned the canteen's floor, perhaps the correct path is to keep moving until reaching the canteen. 

But the user is in the Spare Room now. The hint says to go north. So the next action should be 'go north' again. Let me make sure there's no other direction mentioned. The previous rooms had exits to east, west, south, north. So in the Spare Room, going north is the suggested direction. That's the next step.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and retrieve a teapot from the canteen's floor. So far, they've been moving between the basement, sauna, spare room, and back to the basement. The current room is the basement again.

The user's goal is to get the teapot from the canteen. But the current location is the basement. The exits here are east, south, and west. The user has been moving east, west, south, and north, but they haven't found the canteen yet. 

Wait, the original instruction mentioned the canteen's floor. Maybe the canteen is a different room. The user has been moving through the basement and sauna, but the canteen hasn't been encountered yet. So perhaps the path isn't straightforward. 

The user's current position is the basement. The exits are east, south, and west. The user needs to find the canteen. Maybe the canteen is in a different part of the maze. The user has been moving back and forth between basement and sauna. Maybe they need to go east from the basement to reach the canteen. 

But in the previous steps, when they went east from the basement, they entered the sauna. Then going west from the sauna took them back to the basement. Then going south from the basement led to the spare room, and then north back to the basement. So maybe the canteen is in a different direction. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to find a way to reach the canteen through the basement's east exit. But the east exit leads to the sauna, which doesn't seem to be the canteen. The spare room is another room, but the canteen isn't mentioned there. 

Wait, the original instruction said to retrieve the teapot from the floor of the canteen. So the canteen must be a room that the user hasn't reached yet. The user is currently in the basement. The exits from the basement are east (sauna), south (spare room?), and west. Maybe the canteen is in the south direction? But the spare room was the next room when they went south. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west from the basement to reach the canteen. But the basement's west exit is unguarded. However, the user hasn't explored that path yet. 

Wait, the user's previous moves were: start in basement, go east to sauna, then west back to basement, then south to spare room, then north back to basement. So the user is stuck in a loop between basement, sauna, and spare room. The canteen hasn't been found yet. 

So the next step should be to explore the west exit of the basement. The user hasn't tried that yet. The basement's west exit is unguarded. So maybe going west from the basement will lead to the canteen. 

But in the current prompt, the user is in the basement again, and the exits are east, south, and west. The user needs to try going west to see if that leads to the canteen. The user's next action should be 'go west' again. But the user's last action was 'go south' which led to the spare room. So perhaps the correct path is to go west from the basement to reach the canteen. 

Alternatively, maybe the canteen is in the east direction, but the sauna isn't the canteen. So perhaps the user needs to find another path. But based on the current information, the next logical step is to go west from the basement to explore that direction.

You find yourself in a bedchamber. A standard kind of place.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in a text-based game. Their goal is to retrieve the teapot from the canteen's floor. So far, they've moved between the basement, sauna, spare room, and bedchamber. The current room is the bedchamber, and the instruction is to try going east.

The user's actions so far have been moving east, west, south, north, etc., which suggests they're exploring the maze of rooms. The challenge here is to figure out the correct path to reach the canteen where the teapot is located. Each room they enter provides some hints about possible exits. For example, in the basement, there's an exit to the east and west, and in the bedchamber, east is unblocked.

Since the original goal was to go east first, then north, and retrieve the teapot, maybe the canteen is in a room that's connected via these directions. The user has been moving back and forth, so perhaps they need to find a consistent path. The bedchamber's east exit might lead them closer to the canteen. Alternatively, maybe they need to go back to the basement and try another direction.

But the user's last action was going east from the bedchamber. The next step would be to check if that leads them to the canteen. If not, they might need to backtrack. However, the game's feedback after each move indicates that the user is moving through different rooms, so the correct path might involve continuing east from the bedchamber. Let's assume that going east from the bedchamber is the right move towards the canteen.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they need to retrieve a teapot from the canteen's floor. The current location is the basement, and the exits are east, south, and west. The user has been moving between rooms like the sauna, spare room, bedchamber, and back to the basement.

The goal is to get the teapot from the canteen. So far, the user hasn't found the canteen yet. The basement seems to be a loop, with exits leading back to previous rooms. The sauna and bedchamber didn't mention the teapot. The spare room's description didn't either. Maybe the canteen is another room connected via the basement's east exit? But the user has been going back and forth between basement and other rooms without finding the canteen.

Wait, the original instruction said to go east first, then north, then retrieve the teapot. But the user's movements have been going east, west, south, north, etc., without reaching the canteen. Maybe the canteen is in a different part of the basement? Or perhaps the teapot is in the basement, but the user hasn't checked the floor yet. The user needs to check the basement's floor for the teapot. But the current description of the basement doesn't mention the teapot. The user might need to look around in the basement for it. However, the game's current state might require moving to the canteen through the east exit. But the user hasn't tried that yet. Wait, the first action was go east from the basement, which led to the sauna. Then west back to basement, then south to spare room, north to bedchamber, east back to basement. So maybe the canteen is connected via the east exit of the basement? But the user hasn't tried going east again. Wait, the basement's east exit is unblocked. Maybe the canteen is beyond the east exit. But the user hasn't tried that yet. Alternatively, maybe the teapot is in the basement, and the user needs to check the floor. But the user hasn't looked for it yet. The problem is that the user's actions so far haven't led to the canteen. The original goal was to retrieve the teapot from the canteen's floor, so the user needs to reach the canteen first. But the current path is looping between basement and other rooms. Maybe the user needs to find the canteen through the east exit. Let me check the previous steps. The first move was east from basement to sauna. Then west back to basement.

Let me check the basement's description again. The basement has an exit to the east, south, and west. The user has tried east, west, south, and north. The canteen is probably connected via one of these exits. Since the user hasn't found the canteen yet, the next step should be to try the remaining exit, which is south. But the user has already tried south once. Wait, the user went from basement to spare room by going south. Then from spare room, went north back to basement. So maybe the canteen is in the south exit of the basement. But the user hasn't tried that yet. Wait, the user is in the basement again, so maybe the next action is to go south again. But the user has already done that. Alternatively, maybe the canteen is in the west exit. But the user has tried west and went back to basement. This is confusing. The original goal is to retrieve the teapot from the canteen's floor. The user hasn't reached the canteen yet. So the correct action is to find the canteen. The user needs to explore the exits again. The basement's east exit led to sauna, west to basement, south to spare room. Maybe the canteen is in the south exit. But the user went south once and then back. Maybe the canteen is in the east exit. But the east exit led to sauna. Maybe the user needs to go east again. But the user is in the basement again, so maybe the next action is to go east again.

Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is in a text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and retrieve a teapot from the canteen. The current location is the Sauna, and the previous movements have been going back and forth between the Basement, Sauna, Spare Room, Bedchamber, and back to the Basement again.

The user's goal is to get the teapot from the canteen's floor. So far, the movements have been mostly exploring the basement and sauna, but the canteen hasn't been mentioned yet. The challenge is to find the right path to the canteen without getting stuck in loops.

Looking at the current room, the Sauna, the available exits are north and west. The user has been going east and west, but maybe they need to find a different path. The previous steps showed that the Basement has an exit to the east, which leads to the Sauna. But the canteen is probably in a different area. Maybe the user needs to go north from the Sauna to reach the canteen? Or perhaps there's another way through the basement.

Wait, the original instruction said to go east first, then north, and then retrieve the teapot. But the user has been moving around the basement and sauna, not heading towards the canteen. The canteen might be in a different part of the map. Maybe the user needs to go west from the Sauna to reach the basement again and then find the canteen through another exit.

Alternatively, maybe the canteen is in the Spare Room or Bedchamber. But the user hasn't found the teapot yet. The key is to find the correct path to the canteen. Since the user is currently in the Sauna, trying to go north or west. If they go west from the Sauna, they might return to the basement, which has an exit to the east (Sauna) and west (unblocked). But the canteen isn't mentioned in the basement description. Maybe the canteen is in the Spare Room or Bedchamber, which the user has already visited.

Wait, the user was in the Bedchamber, then went east to the basement again. The canteen might be in the Spare Room. But the Spare Room's description says to go north. Maybe the canteen is north of the Spare Room. But the user hasn't checked that yet. Alternatively, maybe the teapot is in the basement, but the user hasn't looked around.

But the original instruction said to retrieve the teapot from the canteen's floor. So the canteen is a specific location. The user needs to find the canteen room and then pick up the teapot. So far, the user hasn't reached the canteen. The current location is the Sauna, so maybe the next step is to go north from the Sauna to reach the canteen. But the Sauna's description says that north is unguarded. Let me check the previous steps again.

In the Sauna, the user was told to try going north or west. If they go north from the Sauna, maybe that leads to the canteen. Alternatively, going west from the Sauna leads back to the basement. The user might need to explore the north direction from the Sauna to find the canteen. So the next action should be to go north.
</think>go north
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Canteen =-
You've entered a canteen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.



You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a keycard and a teapot on the floor.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user's goal is to retrieve the teapot from the floor of the canteen. So far, they've navigated through various rooms like the basement, sauna, spare room, bedchamber, and now they're in the canteen. The current description mentions that there's a keycard and a teapot on the floor.

The user's next action should be to pick up the teapot. Since the teapot is on the floor, the correct command would be "take teapot". The keycard might be a red herring or part of another puzzle, but the immediate goal is the teapot. So the next step is to take the teapot and complete the task.
