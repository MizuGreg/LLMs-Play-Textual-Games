Welcome to TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First, it would be a great idea if you could attempt to head south. With that done, make an effort to take a trip west. Then, travel south. With that over with, make an effort to venture east. And then, move east. Then, pick-up the passkey from the floor of the bar. That's it!

-= Cookhouse =-
You find yourself in a cookhouse. A standard one.

You can see a closed chest in the corner. You see a counter. The counter is ordinary. But the thing is empty. Hm. Oh well

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

-= Studio =-
You find yourself in a studio. A typical one. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You make out a locked toolbox nearby. You can make out a closed bureau.

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the south. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

-= Scullery =-
You arrive in a scullery. Let's see what's in here.

Look over there! a case. You look around you, at all the containers and supporters, doors and objects, and you think to yourself. Why? Why Textworld? You can see a fridge. The fridge is empty! What a waste of a day!

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text adventure game called TextWorld. The goal is to pick up the passkey from the bar's floor. So far, they've moved south, then west, then to the scullery. The current location is the scullery, and the next step is to decide the next action.

Looking at the environment description for the scullery: there's a case (which might be a chest or a container), a fridge that's empty, and exits to the north, south, and east. The user is told that the exit to the south is unguarded. The previous moves were south, west, and now maybe they need to go east or north. The original task was to go south, then west, then south again, then east, then east, and pick up the passkey from the bar.

Wait, the initial instructions said: first go south, then west, then south, then east, then east, then pick up the passkey. So after the scullery, maybe the next step is to go north or south. But the user is in the scullery. Let me check the exits again. The scullery has exits to north, south, and east. The user needs to follow the path that leads to the bar. The passkey is in the bar's floor, so they need to reach the bar.

In the cookhouse, the exit to the south was unguarded. Then in the studio, the exit to the south was unguarded. Now in the scullery, the exit to the south is unguarded. So maybe going south from the scullery would take them back to the studio or cookhouse? Wait, the initial moves were south (from cookhouse to studio), then west (to scullery). Now, from scullery, going south would take them back to the studio? Or maybe to another area. But the original plan was to go south again after west. So maybe the next step is to go south from the scullery to return to the studio, then proceed further.

Alternatively, maybe the correct path is to go east from the scullery. But the initial instructions said after going west, travel south. So after the scullery, the next step is to go south. Let me check the previous steps again. The user's first action was go south (from cookhouse to studio), then go west (to scullery), then the next step should be to go south again. So from scullery, go south to studio, then maybe east? But the original plan was after west, go south, then east, then east. So maybe after scullery, go south to studio, then east to a new area, then east again to reach the bar.

But the user is in the scullery now. The next action should be to go south, as per the original plan. The user's next move should be go south. However, the user is asking if they are on the right track. The assistant needs to decide the next command. The user's last action was go west to scullery. The next step according to the original plan is to go south. So the correct next action is go south. But the user is asking if they are close. The assistant should respond with the next action, which is go south.

-= Chamber =-
You're now in the chamber. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

There is a sandwich on the floor.

-= Laundromat =-
You've entered a laundromat.

You see a bench. The bench is typical. But the thing is empty.

There is an unblocked exit to the east. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

-= Canteen =-
You've entered a canteen. Let's see what's in here.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in TextWorld, following the initial instructions to move south, west, south, east, east, and then pick up the passkey from the bar. So far, they've gone from Cookhouse -> Studio -> Scullery -> Chamber -> Laundromat -> Canteen.

Now, in the Canteen, the exits mentioned are north and west. The original plan was to go east, east, then get the passkey. But the current location is the Canteen. The user needs to figure out the correct path. The passkey is in the bar's floor, so they need to reach the bar. Maybe the bar is in a different area. Let's check the previous rooms. The Chamber had a sandwich on the floor. The Laundromat had a bench. The Canteen is next. Maybe the next step is to go north from the Canteen, as that's mentioned as an unguarded exit. Alternatively, the west exit is unguarded. But according to the original plan, after the Laundromat, they should go east again. Wait, the original steps were: after west, go south, then east, then east. But in the Laundromat, the user went south to the Canteen. Now, from the Canteen, the exits are north and west. The original plan might have required going east again, but maybe the path is different. Alternatively, perhaps the bar is in the north direction. The user needs to check the exits again. The Canteen has an exit to the west and north. The original goal is to get to the bar. Maybe the bar is in the north direction. So the next action should be to go north. But the user is asking if they're close. The assistant should decide the next command based on the current room's exits and the original plan. Since the original plan after the Laundromat was to go east, but the Canteen's exits are north and west, maybe the correct path is to go north to reach the bar. Alternatively, maybe the bar is in the west. But the user needs to follow the initial instructions. The initial instructions said after going west, go south, then east, then east. So after the Laundromat (which is east of the Canteen?), maybe the next step is to go east again. Wait, the Laundromat's exits were east, north, south, west. The user went south to the Canteen. Now, from the Canteen, the exits are north and west. Maybe the bar is in the north. So the next action is go north. But the user is asking if they're close. The assistant should respond with the next command, which is go north.
