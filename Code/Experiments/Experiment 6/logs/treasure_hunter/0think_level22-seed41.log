What's that over there? It looks like it's a refrigerator. Is this it? Is this what you came to TextWorld to see? a refrigerator? The refrigerator contains a latchkey. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things.
