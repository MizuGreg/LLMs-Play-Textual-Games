Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First, it would be great if you could go south. Then, make an attempt to take a trip east. And then, venture north. That done, lift the sandwich from the floor of the laundry place. Alright, thanks!

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.
