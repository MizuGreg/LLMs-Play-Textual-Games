Welcome to another exciting episode of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to travel east. That done, make an effort to go south. And then, attempt to move south. And then, make an attempt to travel west. Okay, and then, pick up the desktop computer from the floor of the austere workshop. Got that? Good!

-= Cookhouse =-
Well, here we are in the cookhouse.

What's that over there? It looks like it's a board. The board is normal. The board appears to be empty. You think about smashing the board to bits, throwing the bits into a pit, etc, until you get bored.

There is an open passageway leading east. There is an open portal leading north. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game and has been moving through different locations: Cookhouse, Vault, Closet, and now Workshop. The original instructions were to go east, then south, then south again, then west, and finally pick up the desktop computer from the workshop floor.

So far, the user has followed the path: from Cookhouse east to Vault, south to Closet, west to Workshop. Now in the Workshop, they need to pick up the desktop computer. The current description mentions a locked toolbox and an exit to the east and south. The user's next step should be to check the floor for the desktop computer as per the initial instructions. But the user might not have noticed it yet. Since the toolbox is locked, maybe they need a key, but the instructions didn't mention a key. Alternatively, maybe the desktop is already there. The user's last action was going west to the Workshop, so the next logical step is to look for the computer on the floor. The correct action would be to pick it up. But the game might require the user to first check the floor. So the next command should be "pick up desktop computer" or something similar. However, the user's previous actions were movement commands, so maybe they need to check the floor first. The answer should be the command to pick up the computer.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in the Workshop, and they tried to pick up the desktop computer but couldn't. The game's original goal was to pick up the desktop computer from the floor of the austere workshop. The user has been moving through the locations as instructed: east, south, west, and now in the Workshop. The current issue is that they can't see the desktop computer.

The user tried "pick up desktop computer" but it didn't work. Then they tried "look around" and "look under the workbench", but neither worked. Maybe the desktop computer is in a different location or requires a specific action to find it. Since the initial instruction said to pick it up from the floor, perhaps the user needs to check other places on the floor. Maybe the computer is under a table or behind an object. Alternatively, maybe the toolbox is locked and needs a key, but the user hasn't found the key yet. However, the original instructions didn't mention a key, so maybe the computer is just visible once the correct action is taken. Since the user is in the Workshop, the next step might be to check the toolbox if it's unlocked, but the toolbox is described as locked. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to open the toolbox to find the computer inside. But the original instruction was to pick up the computer from the floor, not from the toolbox. Wait, maybe the desktop computer is actually in the toolbox? Or perhaps the user needs to look elsewhere. Since the user tried looking under the workbench and didn't find it, maybe they need to check another spot. The next possible action could be to check the toolbox if it's possible to open it, even though it's locked. But the user might need a key. Alternatively, maybe the computer is already visible but the user isn't looking correctly. Since the user can't see it, maybe they need to use a different command like "examine" or "check floor". However, the allowed commands are limited to movement and actions like picking up. Since the user is stuck, the next action should be to try opening the toolbox if possible, even though it's locked. But the user might need to find the key first. Alternatively, maybe the computer is in a different location. But according to the initial instructions, the goal is to pick it up from the floor. Since the user is in the Workshop, the correct action might be to look around again or check the floor more thoroughly. However, the user has already tried "look around" and "look under the workbench". Maybe the next step is to check the toolbox, even if it's locked, to see if the computer is inside. So the next command would be "open toolbox" or "use key on toolbox", but since the user hasn't found the key, maybe that's not possible. Alternatively, the user might need to move to another part of the workshop. But the exit is to the east and south. The user might need to check the south exit. Wait, the Workshop has an exit to the east and south. The user is currently in the Workshop, so maybe moving south would lead to another area where the computer is. But the original path was to go west to the Workshop. Maybe the computer is in the Workshop, but the user needs to check the floor again. Since the user can't see it, maybe the correct action is to "look around" again, but that didn't work. Alternatively, the user might need to use a different command like "check floor" or "inspect floor". But the allowed commands are limited. The next possible action is to try opening the toolbox, even if it's locked, to see if the computer is inside. So the next command would be "open toolbox".

Okay, the user is stuck in the Workshop, trying to find the desktop computer. They've tried picking it up, looking around, and checking under the workbench multiple times without success. The toolbox is locked and welded shut, so opening it isn't an option. The original goal was to pick up the computer from the floor of the workshop. Since all the obvious places have been checked and nothing is found, maybe the computer is hidden somewhere else. But the user can't see it, so perhaps they need to use a different approach. Maybe the computer is in a different part of the workshop that's not immediately visible. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to interact with another object. However, the only other object mentioned is the locked toolbox. Since the toolbox is locked, perhaps the user needs a key, but there's no mention of a key in the environment. The user might be missing something. The next possible action could be to check the south exit again, as that's an unblocked exit. Maybe the computer is in a different room beyond that. But the original path was to go west to the Workshop. Alternatively, maybe the computer is in the toolbox, but it's locked. Since the user can't open it, maybe they need to find a way to unlock it. But without a key, that's not possible. The user might need to try a different command, like "examine" or "check", but those aren't allowed. The correct action here is to try moving south to check another area, even though the original plan was to pick up the computer in the Workshop. So the next step is to go south.

-= Austere Workshop =-
You find yourself in a workshop. An austere one.

You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a coffer.

There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

There is a desktop computer on the floor.
