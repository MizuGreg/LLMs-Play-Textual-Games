Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to head east. After that, take a trip east. Then, ensure that the portal is open. Then, go to the north. If you can finish that, head west. With that done, doublecheck that the passageway is open. After that, go to the west. After that, pick-up the shadfly from the floor of the spare room. Got that? Good!

-= Cubicle =-
You find yourself in a cubicle. An ordinary one.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Salon =-
Well how about that, you are in the place we're calling the salon. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You see an opened suitcase nearby. The suitcase is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a bed stand. The bed stand is usual. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

There is an open wooden hatch leading east. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.
