Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an life changing round of TextWorld? You do! First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to go to the west. And then, make an attempt to go south. And then, attempt to take a trip east. With that accomplished, pick-up the sandwich from the floor of the shower. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Bedchamber =-
You're now in the bedchamber. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?



There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the south. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

-= Lounge =-
Fancy seeing you here. Here, by the way, being the lounge. Let's see what's in here.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a bar. The bar is ordinary. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a couch. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The couch is typical. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You think about smashing the couch to bits, throwing the bits in the dump, etc, until you get bored. Look over there! a desk! Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is an unguarded exit to the east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

-= Workshop =-
Ah, the workshop. This is some kind of workshop, really great standard vibes in this place, a wonderful standard atmosphere. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

You can see an opened safe. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You make out a stand. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.

There is an unguarded exit to the east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north.

-= Shower =-
You've just sauntered into a shower.



There is an open gateway leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

There is a sandwich on the floor.
