Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is in a game where they need to recover the fondue from the pantry floor. The environment seems to be switching between the Pantry and Office rooms. The user has been repeatedly going north and south between these two rooms. 

Looking at the history, every time they go north from the Pantry, they end up in the Office, and then going south back to the Pantry. This back-and-forth movement suggests that the exits are only allowed in specific directions. The prompt mentions that in the Pantry, they should try east, north, or south, but the Office only has a south exit.

The fondue is on the floor of the Pantry, so the goal is to get it. But the user hasn't picked it up yet. Maybe the issue is that they're stuck in a loop between the two rooms. Since the Office only has a south exit, maybe the key is to find another way out of the Pantry, like east, but the initial advice says to try east, north, or south. However, the user has been going north and south, which might not be the right approach.

Wait, the user's previous actions were going north and south repeatedly. But the Pantry's description says "You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south." So maybe the exits are blocked in some directions, and the user needs to find an unblocked one. But in the Office, the only exit is south, which leads back to the Pantry.

So maybe the user is stuck in a loop because they can't get out of the Pantry. The fondue is there, but they can't leave the room. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east in the Pantry, but the game hasn't allowed that yet. However, the user hasn't tried east yet. The initial advice says to try east, but the user kept going north and south. Maybe the correct path is to go east from the Pantry, but the game's response hasn't shown that path. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go east, but the game's current state doesn't show that. Since the user is stuck in a loop, perhaps the correct action is to try east, but the user hasn't done that yet. However, in the previous steps, the user kept going north and south, which might not be the right approach. The user needs to find an unblocked exit, which might be east, but the game's responses haven't allowed that. 

Wait, the user's last action was going north again, leading back to the Office. The user is stuck in a loop between the two rooms. The fondue is in the Pantry, but the user can't get out. So maybe the correct action is to go east in the Pantry, but the user hasn't tried that yet. However, the user's previous actions were all north and south. The user needs to try east to escape the loop and reach the fondue. But the game's current state might not have that exit open. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go east, but the game's prompt is indicating that the exits are blocked, so the user needs to find an unblocked one. Since the user is in the Pantry, the possible exits are east, north, or south. The user has tried north and south, but maybe east is the right direction. However, the user hasn't tried east yet. So the next action should be to go east to get out of the loop and reach the fondue.

You've just walked into a bar.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the west.
