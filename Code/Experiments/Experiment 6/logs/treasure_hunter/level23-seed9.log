Welcome to another profound session of TextWorld! Here is how to play! Your first objective is to attempt to head north. And then, take a trip east. And then, try to go to the north. With that done, go to the north. With that over with, go to the west. Next, head west. Then, pick up the paper towel from the safe within the sauna. Got that? Good!

-= Bedroom =-
You are in a bedroom. A normal one. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

You can see an opened basket in the room. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this?

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north.

Well, here we are in the closet. You start to take note of what's in the room.



There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing a text adventure game called TextWorld. The initial instructions were to go north, then east, then north again, then west, then west again, and finally pick up the paper towel from the safe in the sauna. 

So far, the user started in the bedroom, went north to the closet. The current location is the closet. The closet has exits to east, north, and south. The user's next steps should follow the original plan.

The original plan after the closet would be to go east (since after the closet, the next step was to go east). Wait, let me check the original instructions again. The user was told: first go north, then east, then north, then north again, then west, then west, then pick up the paper towel.

Wait, the original instructions were: "Your first objective is to attempt to head north. And then, take a trip east. And then, try to go to the north. With that done, go to the north. With that over with, go to the west. Next, head west. Then, pick up the paper towel from the safe within the sauna."

So the sequence is: North -> East -> North -> North -> West -> West -> pick up paper towel.

So after the first North (to the closet), then East. The closet has an exit to the east. So the next action should be to go east. Then, from there, the next step is to go north again. But the user is asking if they're making the right actions so far. The user is in the closet, and the next step according to the plan is to go east. So the correct next action is to go east. Then, after that, they would go north again, as per the plan. So the answer should be "go east".

-= Office =-
You are in an office. An ordinary one.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.



>                                                                                                                                -= Office =-0/3

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text adventure game. The original goal was to go north, then east, then north again, then west, then west again, and finally pick up the paper towel from the safe in the sauna. So far, they've gone from the bedroom north to the closet, then east to the office.

Now, in the office, the exits are east, north, south, and west. The user's next move needs to follow the original plan. The plan after the office would be to go north again, as per the initial instructions. The user has already gone north once (from bedroom to closet), then east (to office). The next step in the original goal was to "try to go to the north" again. So from the office, going north makes sense. The user should go north here. Let me check the available exits again. The office has an exit to the north, which is unguarded. So the correct next action is go north.

-= Study =-
You've just sauntered into a study.

As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a case. A closed box, which looks ordinary, is in the corner.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.



>                                                                                                                                -= Study =-0/4

Okay, let's see. The user is playing a text adventure game, and they've been moving through different rooms: bedroom, closet, office, now study. The original goal mentioned was to go north, then east, then north again, then west, then west again, and finally pick up the paper towel from the safe in the sauna.

So far, the user has gone north from bedroom to closet, then east to office, then north to study. Now, in the study, the prompt says to try going north again. The user's next action should be to go north. But wait, the study's description mentions an exit to the south, but the user is supposed to go north. Let me check the current room: Study. The exits mentioned are north and south. The user's path so far has them moving north, east, north, and now they're in the study. The next step according to the original plan is to go north again. So the correct command here is "go north". The user needs to continue moving north to progress towards the sauna where the paper towel is located. The assistant should just output "go north" as per the instructions.

-= Basement =-
You find yourself in a basement. A typical one.

You can see a cabinet. You make out a workbench. The workbench is typical. However, the workbench, like an empty workbench, has nothing on it.

There is an unguarded exit to the east. There is an unguarded exit to the south. There is an unguarded exit to the west.



>                                                                                                                                -= Basement =-0/5

Okay, let's see. The user has been moving through different rooms in the game: bedroom, closet, office, study, and now the basement. The original goal was to go north, then east, then north again, then west, and finally pick up the paper towel from the safe in the sauna. 

So far, the user has gone north from the bedroom, then east to the office, north to the study, and then north again to the basement. The current room is the basement, which has exits to east, south, and west. The next step in the original plan was to go west. The user has already gone north multiple times, so maybe they need to head west from the basement. But the goal is to pick up the paper towel in the sauna, which hasn't been mentioned yet. However, the user's instructions were to follow the specific path: north, east, north, west, then west again, then pick up the paper towel.

Wait, the original instructions said: "head north. And then, take a trip east. And then, try to go to the north. With that done, go to the north. With that over with, go to the west. Next, head west. Then, pick up the paper towel from the safe within the sauna."

So after going north, east, north, north, west, west, then the paper towel. So in the basement, the user is at the fifth step. The next action should be to go west. The basement has a west exit, so "go west" makes sense. Then, after that, another west, and then maybe reach the sauna where the paper towel is. So the next command should be "go west".

-= Bedchamber =-
You've just sauntered into a bedchamber.



There is an unblocked exit to the east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.



>                                                                                                                                -= Bedchamber =-0/6

Okay, let's see. The user has been moving through different rooms in the game, following the initial instructions to go north, then east, then north again, west, and so on. The goal mentioned was to pick up the paper towel from the safe in the sauna.

So far, the user has gone through Bedroom → Closet → Office → Study → Basement → Bedchamber. Each time, they've been choosing to go north or east or west as per the directions given. Now, in the Bedchamber, the exits are east, north, and west. The prompt says to go west again. But the user is asking if they're on the right track and if they're close to the goal.

Wait, the original goal was to go north, then east, then north again, then west, then west again, then pick up the paper towel from the safe in the sauna. So far, they've done the first few steps. But the current location is Bedchamber. The next step according to the initial instructions was to go west again. But the user is now in Bedchamber and the exits are east, north, west. The user's next action was to go west, which they did. Now, the next step would be to check if they're getting closer to the sauna and the paper towel.

But the user is asking if they're making the right actions. The assistant needs to confirm that the current path is correct. Since the initial instructions were to go north, east, north, west, etc., and the user has followed those steps, it's likely they're on the right track. The next step would be to continue moving towards the sauna. However, the current room is Bedchamber. The next possible direction might be north or west. But the user's last action was go west, so maybe the next step is to go north from Bedchamber. But the user's previous action was go west, so the next command would be to go north. However, the user is asking if they're close, so maybe they need to check if the sauna is nearby. But in the current rooms, the sauna hasn't been encountered yet. So perhaps the user needs to continue moving in the correct directions until they reach the sauna. The next step would be to go north from Bedchamber, as per the initial instructions. But the user's last action was go west, so the next command would be go north. However, the user is asking for the next action, so the assistant should respond with the next command based on the current room's exits. In Bedchamber, the exits are east, north, west. The user's previous steps were going north, east, north, west, and now they're in Bedchamber. The next step according to the initial plan was to go west again, but the user has already done that. Wait, the original instructions said: "go north. With that done, go to the north. With that over with, go to the west. Next, head west. Then, pick up the paper towel from the safe within the sauna." So after going north, then north again, then west, then west again, then pick up the paper towel. So maybe after the initial steps, the user is now in a position where they need to go west again. But in the current Bedchamber, going west would take them to the previous room, which was the basement. But the user has already been there. Maybe the next step is to go north from Bedchamber to reach the next room, which might be closer to the sauna. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to continue moving west. But the current room's exits are east, north, west. The user's last action was go west, so the next action would be to go north. But the user is asking if they're on the right track. The assistant should confirm that the current path is correct and proceed with the next command. The next command would be to go north from Bedchamber.

-= Spare Room =-
You've just walked into a spare room.

You can see a locked coffer.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the west.



>                                                                                                                                -= Spare Room =-0/7

Okay, let's see. The user has been moving through different rooms in the game, following the initial instructions to go north, then east, then north again, west, etc. The original goal mentioned was to pick up the paper towel from the safe in the sauna. So far, the player has navigated through Bedroom → Closet → Office → Study → Basement → Bedchamber → Spare Room. The current room is the Spare Room, which has a locked coffer.

The user's next action needs to be determined. The instructions mentioned going west from the Spare Room. But the current room's description says there's an unguarded exit to the west. However, the user's previous action was going north, which led to the Spare Room. Wait, the last move was "go north" from the Bedchamber to the Spare Room. Now, in the Spare Room, the exits are east (needs unguarded?), south (unblocked), and west (unguarded). The user's next step should follow the original plan, which was to go west after some steps. But the original goal is to get to the sauna's safe. Maybe the path requires moving through more rooms. However, the user's current position is the Spare Room. The locked coffer might be a clue, but the goal is the paper towel in the sauna. So perhaps the next step is to go west from the Spare Room, as per the earlier instructions. The user's previous action was going north, but the current room's exits include west. So the next command should be "go west".

-= Canteen =-
Look around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a canteen.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

So far, the user has navigated through Bedroom, Closet, Office, Study, Basement, Bedchamber, Spare Room, and now Canteen.

Looking at the current room, the Canteen, the exits are east and south. The user's next move should be towards the sauna where the paper towel is located. But how to get there? The previous rooms included a basement, spare room, etc. Maybe the sauna is in a different part of the map. The user needs to find the right path. Since the original plan was to go north, east, north, west, etc., but the current position is Canteen. The next step might be to go south from here, as the exit is unblocked. But the user needs to check if that leads towards the sauna. Alternatively, maybe the sauna is in the basement or another area. However, the user hasn't encountered the sauna yet. The next logical step would be to continue exploring the current room's exits. Since the user is in the Canteen, going south might lead to another room. The user's next action should be to go south.

-= Sauna =-
You've just sauntered into a sauna.

You make out an opened normal looking safe in the room. The safe contains a paper towel. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting.

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. There is an unblocked exit to the north.

Okay, let's see. The user has been moving through different rooms in the TextWorld game. Their goal was to pick up the paper towel from the safe in the sauna. So far, they've reached the sauna, and the safe is there with the paper towel inside.

The current room is the sauna. The user needs to pick up the paper towel. The prompt mentions that the safe is opened and contains the paper towel. So the next logical step is to take the paper towel from the safe.

But wait, the user's previous action was going south to reach the sauna. Now, in the sauna, they need to interact with the safe. The command should be to pick up the paper towel. However, in TextWorld, sometimes you need to open the safe first, but the description says the safe is already opened. So the user can just take the paper towel from the safe.

The original goal was to "pick up the paper towel from the safe within the sauna." Since the user is in the sauna and the safe is opened, the correct action is to take the paper towel. The next command should be "take paper towel" or something similar. But the user's previous commands were all "go [direction]". However, in this case, the action is not moving but interacting with an object. But according to the game's rules, the user might need to use a specific command like "take" or "get".

But the user's instructions say to only output the action, like "go north". However, in this case, the action is not moving but picking up an item. But the game's previous interactions have been about moving. Maybe the game expects the user to use the "take" command. But the user's initial instructions said to follow the example of "go north". However, the original goal was to pick up the paper towel, so the correct action here is to take it.

But the user might have to use the "take" command. However, the previous responses were all movement commands. Maybe the game allows "take" as a valid command here. So the correct next action is "take paper towel".
