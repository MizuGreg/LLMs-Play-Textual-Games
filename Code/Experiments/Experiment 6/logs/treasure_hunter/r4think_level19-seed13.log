Welcome to TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, take a trip west. After that, travel south. With that over with, make an effort to venture west. And then, move south. Then, move south. With that done, go east. Once you manage that, make an attempt to go north. That done, venture east. And then, recover the passkey from the floor of the bar. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Kitchen =-
Welcome to the kitchen.

You make out a board. The board is usual. But there isn't a thing on it. You move on, clearly angry about your TextWorld experience.

You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text adventure game called TextWorld. The goal is to recover the passkey from the floor of the bar after following a series of directions: go west, then south, then west again, south, south, east, north, east, and finally get the passkey.

So far, the user has moved west from the kitchen to the cookhouse, then south to the studio. The current location is the studio. The directions given in the task are to go west, south, west, south, south, east, north, east, and then get the passkey. But the user has already done some of these steps. Let me check the steps again.

The original instructions say: first, take a trip west (so from the start point, go west). Then travel south. Then venture west again, then south, then south. Then go east, then north, then east. Finally, get the passkey from the bar's floor.

But in the current scenario, the user is in the studio. The studio has a locked toolbox and a closed bureau. The exits are north, south, and west. The user's next steps should follow the original plan. Let's see: after the initial west, south, then west again, south, south, east, north, east. So after reaching the studio, the next steps would be to go west (as per the third step: venture west). Wait, but the user is already in the studio. Let me retrace.

Original steps:

1. Start at kitchen, go west → cookhouse.
2. From cookhouse, go south → studio.
3. From studio, venture west (third step).
4. Then south (fourth step).
5. Then south again (fifth step).
6. Then go east (sixth step).
7. Then north (seventh step).
8. Then east (eighth step).
9. Then get passkey from bar's floor.

So after step 2 (studio), the next step is step 3: venture west. So the user should go west from the studio. The studio has an exit to the west. So the next action should be "go west". Then from there, proceed south, etc.

But the user is at the studio now. The current location is the studio. The user's next action should be to go west. So the correct command is "go west".

-= Scullery =-
You arrive in a scullery. Let's see what's in here.

Look over there! a case. You look around you, at all the containers and supporters, doors and objects, and you think to yourself. Why? Why Textworld? You can see a fridge. The fridge is empty! What a waste of a day!

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

You're now in the chamber. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

There is a sandwich on the floor.

-= Closet =-
You find yourself in a closet. An ordinary one. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You make out an opened locker. What a letdown! The locker is empty!

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked.

Okay, let's see. The user is following the steps given in the original task. The goal is to recover the passkey from the bar's floor after moving through various directions.

So far, the user has moved west from the kitchen to the cookhouse, then south to the studio. From the studio, they went west to the scullery, then south to the chamber, and then south again to the closet. Now, in the closet, the options are to go east or north. 

The original instructions said after reaching the studio, the next steps are: venture west, south, south, east, north, east. So after the closet, the next step should be to go east. But wait, the user is in the closet. Let me check the current location.

In the closet, the user can go east or north. The next step in the original plan is after the two souths from the studio, which would be going east. But the user is now in the closet. Let me retrace the steps again.

Original steps after studio:

3. Venture west (from studio to scullery)
4. South (scullery to chamber)
5. South (chamber to closet)
6. Then, go east (from closet to where? Maybe the next room)
7. Then north
8. Then east
9. Get passkey.

So from the closet, the next action should be to go east. The user is at the closet, and the command would be "go east". Then, after that, they would proceed north and east as per the plan. So the next action is "go east".

Okay, let's try to figure out what's going on here. The user is in a text adventure game, and they've been following a set of directions to move through different rooms. The goal is to recover the passkey from the bar's floor.

So far, the user has moved through several locations: kitchen → cookhouse → studio → scullery → chamber → closet → canteen → laundromat. They've been going back and forth between canteen and laundromat, moving north and south. The original plan was to go west, south, west, south, south, east, north, east, and then get the passkey.

But now, in the laundromat, the user is stuck in a loop between canteen and laundromat. The directions say to go east, north, south, west, but they keep cycling. The passkey is supposed to be in the bar's floor, but the user hasn't reached that yet. Maybe they need to find the correct path to the bar.

Wait, the original instructions said after moving south twice from the studio, then go east, north, east. But the user might have taken a wrong turn. Let me check the steps again.

Original steps after studio:
3. Venture west (to scullery)
4. South (to chamber)
5. South (to closet)
6. East (to canteen)
7. North (to laundromat)
8. East (from laundromat to where? Maybe the bar?)

But in the laundromat, the exits are east, north, south, west. If the user goes east from laundromat, they might reach the bar. But in the previous steps, when they were in the canteen, going north led back to laundromat. Maybe they need to go east from laundromat to get to the bar. But the user is currently in laundromat, and the next step should be east. However, in the last interaction, the user went south from laundromat back to canteen. So maybe the correct next step is east from laundromat to reach the bar, then get the passkey.

But the user is in laundromat, and the command would be "go east". Let me check the previous steps. The user was in laundromat, and the options were to go east, north, south, west. So the next action should be east to proceed towards the bar. Then, once in the bar, they can retrieve the passkey.
