Welcome to TextWorld! Your first objective is to make an effort to take a trip west. And then, go to the south. After that, head west. With that accomplished, lift the fly larva from the floor of the cookhouse. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Cubicle =-
Well, here we are in a cubicle. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.



There is an open door leading south. There is an open gateway leading west.

-= Study =-
Of every study you could have walked into, you had to come round an usual one. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You see a locked coffer. You make out a trunk. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You scan the room for a stand, and you find a stand. The stand is typical. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is an open gateway leading east. There is an open gate leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

-= Launderette =-
You arrive in a launderette. A typical kind of place.

You can see a bench. The bench is ordinary. However, the bench, like an empty bench, has nothing on it.

There is an open gate leading east. There is an open portal leading south. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Salon =-
You find yourself in a salon. A normal kind of place. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

Look over there! a safe. The safe is empty! What a waste of a day! You can make out a bar. The bar is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game called TextWorld, and their goal is to follow a series of directions: first go west, then south, then west again. After that, they need to lift the fly larva from the cookhouse floor. So far, the user has been moving west from the Cubicle, then Study, Launderette, and Salon. But when they tried to go west from the Salon, it was blocked. Then they tried going south and east, but it's a loop.

Looking at the current location, they're back in the Salon. The directions mentioned are east and west, but west is blocked. The user is stuck here. The original plan was to go west, south, west. But after moving west from the Salon, they can't go further west. So maybe they need to find another way out of the Salon. The Salon has an exit to the east, which is unblocked. But the user needs to get to the cookhouse. Maybe the cookhouse is in a different part of the map.

Wait, the initial instructions said to go west, then south, then west. But the user is stuck in the Salon. Maybe they need to go east from the Salon to get back to the Launderette, then find another path. Alternatively, maybe the cookhouse is accessible through another route. The user needs to lift the fly larva from the cookhouse floor, so they must be close to it. But how?

The user's current position is the Salon. The exit is east. If they go east back to the Launderette, then maybe go west again? But the Launderette's west exit leads back to the Salon. Hmm. Maybe there's a different path. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go south from the Salon, but that was blocked earlier. Wait, in the Salon, the exit is east, but the user tried going south and it was blocked. So perhaps the cookhouse is accessible through another route, like from the Study or Cubicle?

Wait, the original path was Cubicle (west) -> Study (west) -> Launderette (west) -> Salon (west). But Salon's west is blocked. So maybe the user needs to go east from Salon to Launderette, then south to the Study, then west again? But that seems like going in circles. Alternatively, maybe the cookhouse is in the Study or another room. But the user hasn't found the fly larva yet.

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go south from the Salon, but that was blocked. Wait, in the Salon description, it says there's an exit to the east. So maybe the user needs to go east to the Launderette, then south to the Study, then west to the Cubicle, then south again? But the initial goal was to go west, then south, then west. Maybe the user is getting confused with the directions.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to find the cookhouse through another path. The cookhouse is mentioned in the original goal, so perhaps the user needs to go through the Study or another room. But the user is stuck in the Salon. Maybe the user should try going east again to the Launderette, then south to the Study, then west to the Cubicle, then south again. But that might not be the right path.

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go west from the Salon, but it's blocked. So perhaps the user needs to find another way. The user might need to check the objects in the Salon. The Salon has a safe that's empty and a bar. Maybe the safe has something, but it's empty. The bar is usual. Maybe the user needs to interact with the safe or bar, but the game doesn't mention any actions besides moving. So maybe the user needs to find the cookhouse through another route.

Wait, the original goal was to go west, then south, then west. So after the first west (Cubicle to Study), then south (Study to Launderette?), then west (Launderette to Salon). But then from Salon, west is blocked. So maybe the user needs to go east from Salon to Launderette, then south to Study, then west to Cubicle, then south again? But that's not matching the original directions. Maybe the user is supposed to go west from the Salon, but it's blocked, so they need to find another way.

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go south from the Salon, but that's blocked. So the user is stuck. Maybe the user needs to go east to the Launderette, then south to the Study, then west to the Cubicle, then south again. But the initial directions said to go west, then south, then west. Maybe the user is missing a step. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east from the Salon to the Launderette, then south to the Study, then west to the Cubicle, then south to the next room. But the user hasn't reached the cookhouse yet.

The user's next action should be to go east from the Salon to the Launderette, then proceed. But the user is currently in the Salon. The next step is to go east. But the user tried that and went back to the Launderette. Then from there, maybe go south to the Study again. But the user needs to reach the cookhouse. Maybe the cookhouse is in the Study or another room. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west from the Salon, but it's blocked. So the user is stuck in a loop. The user needs to find a way to proceed.

You're now in the cookhouse.

You can make out a locked case, which looks usual, in the room.

There is an open portal leading north. There is an open hatch leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a fly larva on the floor.
