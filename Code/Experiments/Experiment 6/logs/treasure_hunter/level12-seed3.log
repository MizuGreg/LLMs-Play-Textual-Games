Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to make an effort to go south. With that done, head west. And then, lift the worm from the floor of the kitchenette. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Bar =-
You've entered a bar. You can barely contain your excitement.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

-= Laundromat =-
You are in a laundromat.



There is an unguarded exit to the north. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing a text-based game called TextWorld. The goal so far has been to go south, then west, pick up a worm from the kitchenette, and then stop. The user has already followed the initial instructions: they went south from the bar to the laundromat. Now, they need to go west from the laundromat.

The current location is the laundromat. The available exits are north and west. The user's next step should be to go west, as per the original instructions. The user is asking if they're on the right track and if they're close to the goal. Since they've already gone south and are now at the laundromat, moving west would take them to the next location. The next step is to go west. The user should confirm that this is the correct action and then proceed.
</think>go west

-= Kitchenette =-
A well framed board tells you that you are now in the kitchenette.

You smell a sickening smell, and follow it to a saucepan. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

There is a worm on the floor.

Okay, let's see. The user has been moving through different locations in the game: first into a bar, then a laundromat, and now a kitchenette. The original goal was to pick up the worm from the kitchenette floor and put it in a place, but the user hasn't done that yet.

In the current kitchenette scene, there's a worm on the floor. The user's previous actions were going south (from bar to laundromat), then west (to kitchenette). Now, the next step should be to pick up the worm. The game's prompt mentions that once the worm is lifted, the user can stop. So the immediate action here is to pick up the worm. The user needs to lift it from the floor. The command should be "lift worm" or similar. But the game's previous interactions used commands like "go south" and "go west", so maybe the correct command here is "lift worm". The user needs to check if that's the right action. Since the worm is on the floor, lifting it would be the next logical step after arriving here. The user's previous actions were moving to the kitchenette, so now the task is to pick up the worm. The answer should be "lift worm".

That's not a verb I recognise.

Okay, the user tried to lift the worm but the system said that's not a recognized verb. Let me check the previous steps. The user was in the Kitchenette, there's a worm on the floor. The original instructions said to lift the worm from the floor of the kitchenette.

Wait, maybe the correct command is "pick up worm" instead of "lift worm"? Sometimes games use "pick up" for taking items. Let me confirm the possible verbs. The user had to go south, then west, and then lift the worm. But the system didn't accept "lift". Maybe the correct action is "take worm" or "get worm". Alternatively, maybe "lift" is correct, but the system has a typo. However, the user's previous action was "lift worm", which was rejected. So perhaps the correct command is "take worm" or "pick up worm". Let me check the game's possible commands. Since the user is in the kitchenette, and the worm is on the floor, the correct action is likely "pick up worm" or "take worm". The system might expect "pick up" instead of "lift". So the next action should be "pick up worm".
</think>pick up worm
