I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Your first objective is to take a trip south. After that, make an effort to travel west. Okay, and then, travel south. Then, retrieve the key from the rack. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Canteen =-
You've just shown up in a canteen.

You make out a locked standard looking refrigerator in the corner.

There is an open hatch leading north. There is an open gateway leading south.

-= Workshop =-
You've walked into a normal room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be normal. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the workshop. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.



There is an open gateway leading north. There is an open passageway leading west. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

-= Cookhouse =-
You find yourself in a cookhouse. A typical kind of place.

You can make out a rack. On the rack you can see a key. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a pan. The pan is normal. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Hm. Oh well

There is an unblocked exit to the north.
