I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First, it would be fantastic if you could make an attempt to take a trip south. Then, go to the west. After that, retrieve the sandwich from the floor of the bedroom. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Studio =-
Okay, so you're in a studio, cool, but is it standard? You better believe it is.



There is an unblocked exit to the south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

>                                                                                                                                -= Studio =-0/1
AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go south
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Bathroom =-
Well how about that, you are in a place we're calling a bathroom. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.



>                                                                                                                                -= Bathroom =-0/2
AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go west
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Bedroom =-
You've just walked into a bedroom.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

There is a sandwich and a key on the floor.


>                                                                                                                                -= Bedroom =-0/3
