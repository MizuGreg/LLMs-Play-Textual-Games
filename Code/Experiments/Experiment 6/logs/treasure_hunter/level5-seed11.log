I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! First of all, you could, like, try to go west. If you can manage that, attempt to go to the south. Then, retrieve the laptop from the floor of the studio. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Sauna =-
You've just shown up in a sauna.



There is an unguarded exit to the west.
