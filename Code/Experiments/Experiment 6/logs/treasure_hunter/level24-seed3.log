You are in a restroom. An ordinary kind of place.

You see an opened cabinet close by. The cabinet is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever!

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game called TextWorld, and they've been moving around different rooms. The goal mentioned in the initial prompt was to lift the shadfly from the floor of the laundromat. But so far, the player has been moving between rooms like the restroom, cookery, shower, and kitchenette. 

Looking at the current room, it's the Shower again. The player is told there's an exit to the east and a north entrance. The previous moves have been going back and forth between the Shower and Cookery rooms. The user is asking if they're making the right moves and if they're close to the goal.

Wait, the original instruction mentioned the laundromat, but the current rooms don't seem to include a laundromat. The rooms mentioned are restroom, cookery, shower, kitchenette. Maybe there's a mistake in the room names or the path to the laundromat isn't clear yet. The player hasn't found the shadfly or the laundromat yet.

The user's question is whether they're on the right track. Since the game is a loop between the shower and cookery, maybe they need to find another path. The initial directions said to go west, then north, east, south, etc. But perhaps the correct path is to keep moving east from the shower to reach the laundromat. However, the current room is the shower, and the exit to the east is unguarded. The player might need to go east from the shower to reach the laundromat. But the previous moves have been going south and north, which might not be the right direction.

Alternatively, maybe the laundromat is in the kitchenette or another room. But the player hasn't found the shadfly yet. The goal is to lift the shadfly from the laundromat's floor. So the player needs to reach the laundromat, find the shadfly, and pick it up.

Looking at the rooms, the kitchenette has a locked freezer and an empty fridge. The cookery has a refrigerator. The shower is a recurring room. The restroom has a cabinet. Maybe the laundromat is another room that's not yet explored. The player needs to find the correct path to the laundromat. Since the initial instructions said to go west, then north, east, south, etc., maybe the correct path is to go east from the shower to reach the laundromat. But the current room is the shower, and the exit to the east is unguarded. So the next step should be to go east from the shower to proceed towards the laundromat. The player might be stuck in a loop between the shower and cookery, so going east from the shower could be the right move.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game where they have to navigate through different rooms and eventually lift the shadfly from the laundromat. So far, they've been moving between the Shower, Cookery, and Kitchenette rooms, going back and forth between them. The rooms described have things like refrigerators, freezers, and chairs, but nothing mentioned about a laundromat or a shadfly.

The user is asking if they're making the right moves and if they're close to the goal. From the previous steps, it seems like the player is stuck in a loop between the Shower and Cookery, moving east and west repeatedly. The initial instructions mentioned moving west, then north, east, south, etc., but the player hasn't reached the laundromat yet.

Looking at the current room, it's the Kitchenette. The exit to the east is unblocked, and the player is told to try going west. But the laundromat isn't in any of the rooms described so far. Maybe the laundromat is another room that's not yet explored. The player needs to find the correct path to reach it. Since the game's goal is to lift the shadfly from the laundromat's floor, the player must reach that room.

In the previous steps, the player has been moving between rooms without finding the laundromat. The only way forward is to continue exploring. The next logical step would be to go east from the Kitchenette, as that's the exit mentioned. But the user is already at the Kitchenette, and the exit to the east is unblocked. However, the player hasn't found the laundromat yet. Maybe the laundromat is connected to the Kitchenette or another room. Alternatively, maybe the player needs to find a different path.

Wait, the initial instructions said to go west, then north, east, south, etc. The player has been going back and forth, so maybe they need to find a different direction. But in the current room (Kitchenette), the exit to the east is unblocked. Going east from the Kitchenette might lead to another room. However, the user is at the Kitchenette, and the exit to the east is unblocked. The player should try going east to proceed further. But the user is asking if they're close to the goal, so maybe they need to check if the laundromat is in the next room. Since the laundromat isn't mentioned yet, the player needs to keep exploring. The next action should be to go east from the Kitchenette to continue the journey.
