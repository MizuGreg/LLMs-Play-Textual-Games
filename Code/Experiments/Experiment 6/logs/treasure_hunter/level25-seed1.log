Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're making the right moves and if they're close to winning. Let me recap the steps so far.

Starting in the Bedchamber, they went north to the Spare Room, then north again to the Lounge, east to the Shower, south back to the Studio. In the Studio, they picked up the American latchkey, then went south to the Cubicle. They unlocked the American gate, tried to go east but couldn't because it was closed, then opened it and went east to the Laundromat.

The original goal was to go north, then east, south, get the key from the studio, then south again, unlock the gate in the cubicle, check it's open, go east, get the keycard from the workshop, and win. 

So far, they've done the initial movements, picked up the latchkey, unlocked the gate, and moved to the Laundromat. The next step according to the plan was to get the keycard from the workshop. But the Laundromat is a new area. The user is now in the Laundromat, which has an open wooden passageway leading east. Maybe the workshop is east of here. So the next action should be to go east into the workshop to retrieve the keycard. That would be the next logical step after the Laundromat.

-= Workshop =-
Well, here we are in a workshop. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.



There is an open pine door leading east. There is an open wooden passageway leading west. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north.

There is a keycard on the floor.
