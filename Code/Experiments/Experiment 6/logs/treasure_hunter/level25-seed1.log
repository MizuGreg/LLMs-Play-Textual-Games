Welcome to TextWorld! Your first objective is to attempt to go north. Once you succeed at that, go to the north. With that accomplished, try to move east. After that, travel south. With that done, retrieve the American latchkey from the floor of the studio. Then, venture south. After that, unlock the American gate within the cubicle. Then, doublecheck that the American gate within the cubicle is wide open. Then, take a trip east. Then, try to take a trip east. And then, retrieve the keycard from the floor of the workshop. And once you've done that, you win!

I am sorry to announce that you are now in the spare room.

You make out a workbench. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The workbench is typical. However, the workbench, like an empty workbench, has nothing on it. You see a stand. The stand is ordinary. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this TextWorld game and has a specific sequence of actions to complete. The current location is the Spare Room. The previous action was going north from the Bedchamber to the Spare Room. Now, the user is asking if they're making the right moves and if they're close to the goal.

First, I need to recall the original objective. The user's goal was to go north, then east, south, retrieve the American latchkey from the studio, go south again, unlock the American gate in the cubicle, check that it's open, go east again, retrieve the keycard from the workshop, and then win. 

So far, the user has gone north from the Bedchamber to the Spare Room. The next step in their plan was to go east, but in the Spare Room, the exits are east and south. The user is now at the Spare Room, and the next logical step according to their plan is to go north again? Wait, no. Wait, the original plan after the first north was to go east. But in the Spare Room, the exits are east and south. The user's plan was after the first north, go east. But in the Spare Room, going east is possible. However, the user's next action in the plan was to go east after the initial north. But the user is now in the Spare Room, so maybe they need to go east from here. But the user is asking if they're on the right track.

Wait, the user's plan was: after the first north (which they did), go east. But in the Spare Room, the user can go east or south. The original plan says after going north (from bedchamber to spare room), go east. So the next action should be east. But the user is now in the Spare Room, and the next step in their plan is to go east. However, the user is asking if they're on the right track. The user might be confused because in the Spare Room, going east is possible, but maybe there's a trick here. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go south first? But according to the plan, after the initial north, they should go east. So the next action should be east. But the user is asking if they're making the right moves. The user might be uncertain because the Spare Room has an east exit, but maybe there's something else. However, the game's description says that the workbench is empty, the stand is empty, so maybe there's nothing to do here. The user's plan is to go east from the Spare Room. So the next command should be "go east". But the user is asking if they're on the right track. The assistant needs to confirm that the next action is indeed east. But the user is in the Spare Room, and the next step in the plan is to go east. So the correct next action is "go east".

-= Studio =-
You are in a studio. An usual one.



There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

There is a loaf of bread and an American latchkey on the floor.

Okay, let me figure out what to do next. The user has been following the instructions step by step. The original goal was to go north, then east, south, retrieve the American latchkey, then south again, unlock the American gate in the cubicle, check that it's open, go east, get the keycard from the workshop, and win.

So far, they started in the bedchamber, went north to the spare room, then east to the studio. Now in the studio, they see a loaf of bread and the American latchkey on the floor. The next step according to the original plan was to retrieve the American latchkey. Since it's on the floor here, they should pick it up. But the command format is just the action. So the next command should be "take American latchkey" or something similar. Wait, but in TextWorld, the commands are usually "take [item]" or "get [item]". The user has to pick up the latchkey. So the next action is to take the American latchkey. Then, after that, they need to go south as per the plan. But the user's next input is to confirm if they're on the right track. The user's last action was going east to the studio. Now, in the studio, the next step is to pick up the latchkey. So the correct command here is "take American latchkey".

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game called TextWorld. Their goal is to follow a series of steps to win. Let me recap the current state.

They started in the Bedchamber, went North to the Spare Room, then East to the Studio. In the Studio, they found the American latchkey and picked it up. Now, the next step according to the original instructions was to venture south after retrieving the latchkey. Wait, the original plan was: after getting the latchkey, go south, then unlock the American gate in the cubicle, check it's open, go east, get the keycard from the workshop, then win.

But the user is in the Studio now. The current room description says there's an exit to the north, south, and west. The user has the American latchkey. The next step should be to go south from the Studio. Let me check the previous steps again.

Yes, the original instructions said after getting the latchkey, venture south. So the next command should be 'go south'. Then they would enter the room south of the Studio. The next steps after that involve unlocking the gate, checking it's open, etc. But the user's next action now is to go south. So the correct command here is 'go south'.

-= Cubicle =-
You are in a cubicle. It seems to be pretty standard here. You start to take note of what's in the room.



There is a closed American gate leading east. There is an unguarded exit to the north. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps given in the initial prompt. They started by going north from the bedchamber to the spare room, then east to the studio. In the studio, they picked up the American latchkey and went south to the cubicle.

Now, in the cubicle, they need to unlock the American gate. The next step according to the original plan was to unlock the American gate within the cubicle. Since they have the American latchkey, that's probably the key to unlock the gate. So the next action should be to use the latchkey on the gate. But the game might require a specific command like "unlock American gate" or "use American latchkey on American gate". However, the user's previous actions were straightforward commands like "go north" or "take American latchkey". So maybe the correct command here is "unlock American gate" or "use latchkey on gate". But since the gate is closed and they have the key, the appropriate action is to try unlocking it. The game's response will guide if that's correct. So the next step is to attempt to unlock the gate.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps given in the initial instruction. They started by going north from the bedchamber, then east to the spare room, then east again to the studio. In the studio, they picked up the American latchkey and went south to the cubicle. Now, they've unlocked the American gate in the cubicle.

The next step according to the original plan was to "doublecheck that the American gate within the cubicle is wide open." So after unlocking it, they need to verify that it's indeed open. But the game's current state shows that the gate is unlocked, so maybe the next action is to check if it's open. However, the user's last action was unlocking it, and the response indicates that the gate is now unlocked. 

But the instruction says to double-check that it's wide open. So perhaps the next step is to go through the gate or check its state. However, the available exits in the cubicle are north, west, and east (the unlocked gate). Since the gate is east, maybe the next step is to go east through the unlocked gate. But the original plan says after unlocking, double-check it's open, then take a trip east, then try east again, then retrieve the keycard from the workshop.

Wait, the user's current location is the cubicle. After unlocking the gate, they need to confirm it's open. But in the game, after unlocking, the gate might be considered open. So maybe the next step is to go east through the gate. However, the original instructions mention after unlocking the gate, double-check it's open, then take a trip east. So perhaps the next action is to go east through the American gate. But the user has to make sure it's open. Since they just unlocked it, it's open. So the next action is to go east.

But the user's last action was unlocking the gate, and the game's response is the same as before. So the next step is to go east. Then, after that, they need to go east again (as per the original plan: "try to take a trip east. Then, try to take a trip east. And then, retrieve the keycard from the floor of the workshop.")

Wait, the original plan says after unlocking the gate, then "doublecheck that the American gate within the cubicle is wide open. Then, take a trip east. Then, try to take a trip east. And then, retrieve the keycard from the floor of the workshop."

So after unlocking, the user needs to check if the gate is open (which it is), then go east. Then try east again (maybe to get to the workshop?), then get the keycard.

So the next action after unlocking is to go east through the gate. So the next command should be "go east".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a sequence of actions in TextWorld. Their goal is to eventually retrieve the keycard from the workshop and win. Let me recap the steps they've taken so far.

First, they started in the Bedchamber, went north to the Spare Room, then east to the Studio. In the Studio, they picked up the American latchkey and went south to the Cubicle. There, they unlocked the American gate using the latchkey. Now, they tried to go east, but the game responded that they need to open the American gate first. Wait, but they just unlocked it. Maybe the gate is still closed even though they unlocked it? Or perhaps the game is checking if the gate is open before allowing movement.

The user's next action should be to check if the gate is open. But according to the game's message, they have to open it first. However, they already used the latchkey to unlock it. Maybe there's a step missing here. Let me check the previous steps again.

In the Cubicle, after unlocking the gate, the user tried to go east, but the game said they need to open the gate first. That suggests that even though they unlocked it, the gate might not be fully open yet. So perhaps the next step is to open the gate again, or maybe there's a different action required. But the user has the latchkey, so maybe they need to use it again to open the gate. Wait, but they already used it to unlock it. Maybe the game is expecting them to confirm that the gate is open. Alternatively, maybe the gate is locked again, and they need to use the key again to open it.

Alternatively, maybe the game's message is a bit confusing. The user has already unlocked the gate, so perhaps they can proceed east. But the game is saying they need to open it first. Maybe the gate is still closed, and the user needs to open it again. But how? The only way is to use the latchkey again. So the next action should be to open the American gate again with the latchkey. But the user already did that. Wait, maybe the game is in a state where the gate is unlocked but not open, so they need to open it. So the correct action is to open the gate again. But the user already used the latchkey to unlock it. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check if the gate is open. But the game's message says they have to open it first. So perhaps the next step is to open the gate again. But the user already did that. Maybe the game is expecting them to go east after opening it. But the user tried to go east and got a message that they need to open the gate first. So maybe the gate is still closed, and they need to open it again. Therefore, the next action should be to open the American gate again. But the user already has the latchkey. So the correct command would be "open American gate" again. But the previous action was "unlock American gate". Maybe the game is using different verbs. Let me check the previous messages.

In the Cubicle, the user had the American latchkey. They used "unlock American gate", which worked. Then they tried to go east, but the game said they need to open the gate first. So perhaps the gate is not fully open yet. Therefore, the next action should be to open the gate again. But the user already unlocked it. Maybe the correct verb is "open" instead of "unlock". But the user used "unlock". Alternatively, maybe the game is expecting them to use the key again. So the next action is to open the American gate. But the user already did that. Wait, maybe the game is in a state where the gate is unlocked but not open, so they need to open it. Therefore, the next action is to open the gate. But how? The user has the key, so maybe they need to use it again. But the game's message says they need to open the gate first. Therefore, the correct action is to open the American gate again. But the user already did that. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east after opening the gate. But the game is preventing them from moving east until the gate is open. So the correct action is to open the gate again. Therefore, the next command should be "open American gate".

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text adventure game. Their goal is to follow a series of steps to win. Let me recap what's happened so far.

Starting in the bedchamber, they went north to the spare room, then east to the studio. In the studio, they picked up the American latchkey and went south to the cubicle. There, they unlocked the American gate, tried to go east but couldn't because the gate was still closed, then opened it successfully.

Now, the next step according to the original instructions was to "doublecheck that the American gate within the cubicle is wide open." The user just opened the gate, so maybe they need to verify it's open. But the game's response after opening the gate says "You open American gate." So perhaps the gate is now open. Then the next step was to take a trip east, then retrieve the keycard from the workshop.

Wait, after opening the gate, the user is in the cubicle. The current location is the cubicle, and the gate east is now open. The next step would be to go east through the open gate. But the user tried to go east before opening the gate and got a message that the gate needs to be opened first. Now that it's open, they should go east.

So the next action should be "go east" again. But the user just opened the gate, so maybe they need to check if it's open, but the game might automatically consider it open. The next step in the original plan was to go east, then retrieve the keycard from the workshop. So after opening the gate, the next step is to go east into the next room, which should be the workshop. Then, after getting the keycard, they win.

So the correct next action is "go east" again. The user's last action was "open American gate", and the game's response was "You open American gate." So now, they need to move east to the next room, which is the workshop. Then, after that, they can pick up the keycard and win.

First, they started in the bedchamber, went north to the spare room, then east to the studio. In the studio, they picked up the American latchkey and went south to the cubicle. They unlocked the American gate and tried to go east, but the gate needed to be opened first. After opening it, they went east into the laundromat.

Now, the current room is the laundromat. The next step in the original goal was to take a trip east again and then retrieve the keycard from the workshop. But the user is in the laundromat, which is a new room. The previous steps have been successful, but they haven't yet reached the workshop.

The laundromat has an open wooden passageway leading east. The next logical step would be to go east from here. The user's next action should be to move east into the next room. Since the goal is to retrieve the keycard from the workshop, moving east from the laundromat makes sense as the workshop might be in that direction. The user needs to continue following the path, so "go east" is the correct command here.

Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game called TextWorld, and their goal is to follow a series of steps to win. Let me recap the steps they need to take based on the initial instructions:

1. Go north from the bedchamber.
2. Then go east.
3. Then travel south.
4. Retrieve the American latchkey from the studio floor.
5. Venture south again.
6. Unlock the American gate in the cubicle.
7. Check that the gate is open.
8. Go east again.
9. Retrieve the keycard from the workshop floor.
10. Win.

Now, looking at the current state of the game. The user is in the Workshop, and there's a keycard on the floor. The next step according to the original plan is to retrieve the keycard. The user has already collected the American latchkey earlier, so now they need the keycard. The instruction says to take the keycard from the workshop floor. The current location is the Workshop, and the keycard is there. So the correct action here is to pick up the keycard. The user's next move should be to take the keycard. Let me check if there are any obstacles. The workshop has exits east, west, and north, but the keycard is on the floor, so just pick it up. The next step after that would be to go north to complete the goal. But according to the original plan, after retrieving the keycard, they win. So the correct command here is to take the keycard.
