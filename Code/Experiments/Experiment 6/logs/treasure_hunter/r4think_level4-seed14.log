Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. Your first objective is to make an attempt to venture west. Next, retrieve the nest of bugs from the floor of the office. Got that? Good!

-= Cellar =-
You've just walked into a cellar. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. There is an unguarded exit to the north. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

You arrive in an office. An usual kind of place.



There is an unblocked exit to the east.

There is a nest of bugs on the floor.

That's not a verb I recognise.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is playing a text-based game where they have to navigate through different rooms and complete tasks. The current scenario is in the Office room. The user's first action was to go west, which led them to the Office. Then they tried to "retrieve the nest of bugs from the floor of the office," but the system said that's not a recognized verb.

Hmm, so the problem is that "retrieve" might not be the correct command here. In text adventures, common verbs are like take, get, pick up, or maybe use. Since the nest of bugs is on the floor, the correct action might be to "take" or "get" the nest. But the user tried "retrieve," which isn't a standard command. The system is probably expecting a different verb.

The user is asking if they're on the right track. They need to make sure they're using the correct commands. The goal is to retrieve the nest, so the next step is to use the right verb. Maybe "take" is the correct command here. Let me check the previous messages. The user was told to "retrieve the nest of bugs from the floor of the office," but the system rejected it. So perhaps the correct command is "take" instead of "retrieve."

So the next action should be "take the nest of bugs" or "get the nest of bugs." But the system might expect a more concise command. Maybe just "take nest" or "get nest." But the exact phrasing might matter. Alternatively, since the nest is on the floor, maybe "pick up the nest" is the correct verb.

Wait, in many text adventures, the command is "take" followed by the item. So "take nest of bugs" or "take the nest of bugs." But the user's previous attempt was "retrieve the nest of bugs," which the system didn't recognize. So the correct command is likely "take" instead of "retrieve."

Therefore, the next action should be "take the nest of bugs" or "take nest." But the user needs to input the correct command. The system might accept "take nest" as the command. Let me make sure. The user's previous action was "retrieve the nest of bugs from the floor of the office." The system said that's not a verb. So the correct verb is "take" or "get."

So the next action should be "take the nest of bugs" or "get the nest of bugs." But since the user is supposed to only output the command, maybe "take nest" is sufficient. Alternatively, "get nest." But I need to check if the game expects a specific phrasing.

Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "pick up the nest of bugs." But the user might need to use the exact wording. However, the user's previous attempt was "retrieve," which was incorrect. So the correct verb is "take."

Therefore, the next action should be "take the nest of bugs." But the user might have to input it as "take nest" if the game is lenient with phrasing. But since the system is strict, maybe "take the nest of bugs" is the correct command. However, the user's previous attempt was "retrieve the nest of bugs from the floor of the office," which was too long. Maybe the game expects a shorter command.

Alternatively, maybe the correct command is just "take nest." Let me think. In many text adventures, you can just say "take nest" if the game is expecting that. So the user should try "take nest" as the next action.
