I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! First of all, you could, like, go east. Then, go north. With that over with, recover the sandwich from the floor of the laundry place. Alright, thanks!

-= Workshop =-
Look around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a workshop.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Spare Room =-
You arrive in a spare room. An ordinary one. You begin to take stock of what's here.



There is an unguarded exit to the east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

-= Laundry Place =-
You are in a laundry place. An ordinary one. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.



You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a sandwich on the floor.
