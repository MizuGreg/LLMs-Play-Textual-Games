Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First step, go to the east. With that accomplished, try to move north. Okay, and then, travel east. If you can get around to doing that, make an attempt to travel south. Then, pick up the stapler from the floor of the studio. Alright, thanks!

-= Attic =-
Look around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in an attic.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

-= Canteen =-
Well, here we are in a canteen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.
