Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to ensure that the gateway is open. And then, head south. Okay, and then, head west. Okay, and then, make an effort to move south. Then, recover the key from the rack. That's it!

-= Canteen =-
You've just shown up in a canteen.

You make out a locked standard looking refrigerator in the corner.

There is a closed gateway leading south. There is an open hatch leading north.

You've walked into a normal room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be normal. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the workshop. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.



There is an open gateway leading north. There is an open passageway leading west. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

-= Sauna =-
You've entered a sauna. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You make out a counter. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can make out a shelf. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Workshop =-
You've walked into a normal room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be normal. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the workshop. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.



There is an open gateway leading north. There is an open passageway leading west. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

-= Salon =-
You find yourself in a salon. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.



There is an unguarded exit to the south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.
