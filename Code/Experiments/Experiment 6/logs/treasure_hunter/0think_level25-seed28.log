Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First, it would be great if you could attempt to go south. Once you get through with that, make an effort to venture east. And then, go to the south. And then, take a trip west. After that, make an attempt to go south. After that, venture south. Then, move east. And then, make an attempt to move north. And then, go east. After that, make an attempt to go to the north. With that accomplished, pick up the passkey from the floor of the attic. Alright, thanks!

However, the bowl, like an empty bowl, has nothing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.
