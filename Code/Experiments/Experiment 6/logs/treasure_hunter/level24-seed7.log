Welcome to another life changing round of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to try to head east. Okay, and then, try to go east. Then, go north. Once you get through with that, make an effort to go to the east. Once you accomplish that, try to head south. Following that, venture south. Then, go west. And then, go west. Then, retrieve the keycard from the saucepan. That's it!

-= Dish-Pit =-
You are in a dish-pit. An usual one.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an unguarded exit to the south. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

-= Vault =-
You are in a vault. A typical kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.



There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an unblocked exit to the south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

Okay, let's see. The user has been given a series of directions to move in the game. They started in the dish-pit, went east to the vault. Now, they're in the vault. The original task was to go east, then east again, then north, then east, then south, then west, then retrieve the keycard from the saucepan.

Wait, the user's current location is the vault. Let me check the exits again. The vault has unblocked exits to the east, south, and west. The original instructions said after going east from the dish-pit, then east again, then north, then east, then south, then west. So after the first east to the vault, the next steps are east again, then north, etc.

So in the vault, the next action should be east again as per the instructions. The user's next move should be "go east" again. But wait, the user's last action was "go east" from the dish-pit to the vault. Now, in the vault, the next step in the sequence is to go east again. But looking at the vault's description, there's an unblocked exit to the east. So the correct next action is east. Then after that, the next step is north, etc. So the answer should be "go east".

-= Cubicle =-
You've just shown up in a cubicle. Let's see what's in here.

Were you looking for a toolbox? Because look over there, it's a toolbox. You can make out an armchair. The armchair is usual. However, the armchair, like an empty armchair, has nothing on it. You move on, clearly furious with TextWorld.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following a series of directions to move in different directions: east, north, east again, south, south again, west, west again, and then retrieve the keycard from the saucepan. So far, they've gone through the dish-pit, vault, and cubicle. The current location is a cubicle, and the exits are east, north, south, and west. The goal was to get the keycard from the saucepan.

In the cubicle description, there's a toolbox and an armchair, but nothing else mentioned. The user needs to find the keycard in a saucepan. Since the previous steps involved moving east, north, south, and west, maybe the saucepan is in one of those directions. But the current location is a cubicle, so the exits are the directions to check. The user has to look for the saucepan in the cubicle or maybe in one of the adjacent rooms. However, the keycard is in the saucepan, so perhaps the saucepan is in the cubicle. But the description doesn't mention a saucepan here. Wait, maybe the saucepan is in a different room. Alternatively, maybe the keycard is in the cubicle, but the user hasn't found it yet. The user's next action should be to check the available exits again. Since the user has been moving east, maybe the next step is to go north or south. But the user's previous actions included going east, then east again, then south, south, west, west. Maybe the saucepan is in the west direction. But the user is in the cubicle now. The exits are east, north, south, west. The user needs to check each direction. But the original instruction was to go east, then north, then east, then south, then south, then west, then west, then retrieve the keycard from the saucepan. So maybe after moving west twice, they reach a room with the saucepan. But the current location is the cubicle. Maybe the saucepan is in the cubicle, but the user hasn't noticed it. Alternatively, the saucepan is in another room. The user needs to continue moving according to the original plan. The original plan was to go east, north, east, south, south, west, west. So after the cubicle, the next step would be to go west again. But the user is already in the cubicle. The exits are east, north, south, west. So the next action would be to go west again. But the user has already gone west twice. Wait, the original instructions said: after getting through with the initial directions (east, north, east, south, south, west, west), then retrieve the keycard from the saucepan. So maybe after moving west twice, the user is in a room where the saucepan is. But the current location is the cubicle. So perhaps the user needs to check the cubicle for the saucepan. But the description doesn't mention a saucepan here. Maybe the saucepan is in the west direction. So the user should go west again. But the user is in the cubicle. The exits are west, so going west from the cubicle would be the next step. So the next action is go west.

There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an unblocked exit to the south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game and has been moving around different rooms. The original task was to follow a series of directions: go east, then east again, north, then east, south, south, west, west, and finally retrieve the keycard from the saucepan.

So far, the user has gone east from the dish-pit, then east again into the vault, then west back to the cubicle, and then west again to the vault. Now they're back in the vault. The next step in the original instructions was to go south after venturing south. Wait, the user already went south from the vault once when they first entered from the dish-pit. But maybe they need to go south again?

Wait, let me check the path again. The initial steps were: east, east, north, east, south, south, west, west. So after the first east (dish-pit to vault), then another east (vault to cubicle?), then north (cubicle to vault?), then east (vault to somewhere?), then south, south, west, west. Hmm, maybe the user is getting confused with the directions.

But in the current state, they're in the vault again. The exits here are east, south, and west. The original goal was to retrieve the keycard from the saucepan. The user hasn't found the saucepan yet. So maybe the keycard is in the vault? Or perhaps the saucepan is in another room.

But according to the previous steps, after going west from the cubicle, they ended up back in the vault. The next step in the original plan was to go south. So from the vault, going south would be the next move. Then again, south again. Then west, west. But the user is at the vault again. So the next action should be to go south, as per the original instructions. The user needs to follow the sequence: after the vault, go south, then south again, then west, west, then get the keycard from the saucepan.

So the correct next action is to go south from the vault.

-= Scullery =-
You find yourself in a scullery. A normal one. The room is well lit.

You can see a chest. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a saucepan. The saucepan is usual. On the saucepan you can see a keycard.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

Okay, let's see. The user's goal was to retrieve the keycard from the saucepan. Looking at the current room, the Scullery, there's a saucepan with a keycard on it. The user is in this room now. The exits are east, north, and west. The instruction says to go west, but the user needs to get the keycard. Wait, the keycard is on the saucepan here, so maybe the next step is to pick it up. But the game might require moving to the correct location first. The user has been moving through different rooms, and now they're in the Scullery. The saucepan is here, so the keycard is in this room. The user needs to take the keycard. But the game's commands might require interacting with the saucepan. However, the user's previous actions were moving around, and the last instruction was to go west. But in the current room, the keycard is already here. Wait, maybe the user needs to pick it up. But the game might not have a 'take' command. Alternatively, maybe the keycard is already in the saucepan, and the user just needs to pick it up. But the user's previous steps were moving through the rooms. The original task was to retrieve the keycard from the saucepan. So in this room, the keycard is on the saucepan. Therefore, the next action should be to take the keycard. But the user's previous commands were moving, so maybe the correct action here is to pick up the keycard. However, the game's commands might be limited to movement. Wait, the user's last action was moving west, but in the current room, the keycard is here. So the next step is to take the keycard. But the user's instructions said to retrieve the keycard from the saucepan. So the correct action is to take the keycard. But the game might require the user to interact with the saucepan. However, the user's previous commands were just moving. So maybe the answer is to take the keycard. But the user's last movement was west, and now they are in the Scullery. The keycard is here, so the next action is to take it. But the user's previous steps were moving through the rooms, and the keycard is in this room. Therefore, the next action is to take the keycard.

However, the user's previous steps were moving, so the next action is to take the keycard. But the user's instructions said to retrieve it, so the answer is to take the keycard. But the game might require the user to use the 'take' command. However, the user's previous commands were movement. Therefore, the next action is to take the keycard. But the user's last movement was west, and now they are in the Scullery. The keycard is here, so the next action is to take it.
