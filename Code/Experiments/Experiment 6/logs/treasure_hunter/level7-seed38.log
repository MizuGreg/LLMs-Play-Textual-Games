Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to make an attempt to move south. Then, take a trip east. After that, travel north. With that done, lift the key from the floor of the vault. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Lounge =-
You arrive in a lounge. A typical one. You start to take note of what's in the room.



There is an unguarded exit to the south.

-= Spare Room =-
You find yourself in a spare room. A standard one.



There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.
