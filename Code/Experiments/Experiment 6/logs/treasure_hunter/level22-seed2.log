Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an exciting round of TextWorld? You do! Here is your task for today. First, it would be a great idea if you could go to the south. If you can finish that, take a trip east. Once you manage that, make an effort to take a trip east. With that done, go to the north. And then, lift the passkey from the floor of the spare room. That's it!

-= Scullery =-
You arrive in a scullery. A typical kind of place. You start to take note of what's in the room.

There is an unguarded exit to the east. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text adventure game, and they've been moving around different rooms like the Scullery, Bedroom, Vault, and Attic. The goal mentioned at the start was to go south, then east, then east again, then north, and finally lift the passkey from the spare room.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Vault again after moving west from the Scullery. The Vault has a closed crate and a shelf, but nothing about a passkey mentioned here. The exits here are east, north, and south. The original goal was to get to the spare room and lift the passkey. 

Wait, the user has been looping between the Scullery, Vault, and Attic. Maybe they need to find the correct path to the spare room. The initial instructions said to go south, then east, then east, then north. But the user has been going back and forth. Maybe they need to check if the passkey is in the Vault or another room. 

In the Vault, there's a closed crate. Maybe the passkey is inside? But the user hasn't opened it yet. The shelf is empty, so maybe not. The Attic has a banana on the floor, but that's probably not relevant. 

The user's current position is the Vault. The exits are east, north, south. The original plan was to go north from the Scullery, but that led to the Vault. Maybe the passkey is in the spare room, which might be accessible through another path. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to find the correct sequence of moves to reach the spare room without looping.

Wait, the initial instruction said to go south, then east, then east, then north, then lift the passkey. The user has been going south, then north, then west, then south again. Maybe they need to find a different route. Let me check the rooms again.

In the Scullery, there's an unguarded exit to the east. The Bedroom has an unguarded exit to the west. The Vault has an unguarded exit to the south. The Attic has an unguarded exit to the north. Maybe the user needs to go from the Vault to the Attic (south), then east to the Bedroom, then north to the Scullery, then east again? But that's the same loop.

Alternatively, maybe the passkey is in the spare room, which is the Vault? Or maybe the spare room is a different location. The user needs to lift the passkey from the floor of the spare room. So the spare room must be a room where the passkey is on the floor. 

In the current Vault, there's no mention of a passkey. The user hasn't checked the crate or the shelf. Maybe they need to open the crate? But the game doesn't mention any action to open it. Alternatively, maybe the passkey is in the Attic, but there's a banana there. 

Wait, the user's goal is to lift the passkey from the spare room. So the spare room must be a specific room. Maybe the spare room is the Vault? Or maybe the Attic? But the user hasn't found it yet. 

Looking at the previous steps, the user has been moving between rooms without finding the passkey. The next step would be to check the crate in the Vault or look for other items. But the game's responses don't mention any actions except moving. So perhaps the user needs to continue moving until they reach the spare room. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go east from the Vault. The Vault's exits are east, north, south. If they go east from the Vault, they might reach the Bedroom again. But the user has already been there. 

Hmm, maybe the user needs to go north from the Vault. The Vault has an unguarded exit to the north. Going north from the Vault would take them to the Attic again. But the Attic has an exit to the north (which is unguarded). Wait, the Attic's description says there's an exit to the north. So maybe going north from the Attic would take them to another room. But the user hasn't checked that yet. 

Alternatively, maybe the passkey is in the spare room, which is the Scullery? But the Scullery has a freezer. The user hasn't checked the floor there. The initial instruction said to lift the passkey from the floor of the spare room. So maybe the spare room is the Scullery, and the passkey is on the floor. But the user hasn't checked that yet. 

Wait, the user's current position is the Vault. The next step would be to check the exits again. The Vault has an unguarded exit to the south (Attic), east, and north. The user might need to go east from the Vault to the Bedroom, then north to the Scullery, then east again, then north to reach the spare room. But the user has been looping here. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go north from the Vault to the Attic, then east to the Bedroom, then north to the Scullery, then east again, then north to reach the spare room. But the user hasn't done that yet. 

Wait, the initial instructions said to go south, then east, then east, then north. The user has been going south, then north, then west, then south again. Maybe they need to follow the initial path again. Let me check the initial steps:

Start in Scullery, go south to Bedroom, then north to Scullery again? No, the initial instruction was to go south first. Maybe the user needs to go east from the Scullery. 

But the user is currently in the Vault. Maybe the correct path is to go east from the Vault to the Bedroom, then north to the Scullery, then east again, then north to reach the spare room. But the user hasn't done that yet. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check the crate in the Vault. The crate is closed, so maybe they need to open it. But the game doesn't mention any action to open it. The user can only move. 

Wait, the user's last action was going west from the Scullery to the Vault. Now, in the Vault, the exits are east, north, south. The user needs to find the passkey. Maybe the passkey is in the Vault, but the user hasn't checked the floor. The initial goal was to lift the passkey from the floor of the spare room. So maybe the spare room is the Vault, and the passkey is on the floor. But the user hasn't checked that yet. 

But the game's description of the Vault doesn't mention a passkey. The user needs to check the floor. However, the game's responses don't include any actions to check the floor. The user can only move. 

So maybe the user needs to continue moving until they reach the spare room. The initial plan was to go south, then east, then east, then north. The user has been going in circles. Maybe the correct path is to go east from the Vault to the Bedroom, then north to the Scullery, then east again, then north to reach the spare room. 

But the user is in the Vault. So the next step would be to go east to the Bedroom. Then north to the Scullery, then east again, then north. But the user has already done that. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go north from the Vault to the Attic, then east to the Bedroom, then north to the Scullery, then east again, then north. 

But the user is in the Vault. The next action would be to go east, then north, then east, then north. 

But the user's last action was go west, leading to the Vault. So the next step is to go east from the Vault. That would take them to the Bedroom again. Then north to the Scullery, then east again, then north. 

But the user has been going back and forth. Maybe the correct action is to go east from the Vault to the Bedroom. Then north to the Scullery, then east again, then north. 

But the user is in the Vault. So the next action is go east.

Okay, let's try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text adventure game and has been moving through different rooms. The original goal was to go south, then east, then east again, then north, and finally lift the passkey from the spare room.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Chamber again after moving south from the Washroom. The Chamber has a chest and exits to north, east, and south. The previous steps have the user looping between the Chamber, Washroom, and other rooms. The passkey hasn't been found yet.

The user needs to reach the spare room where the passkey is on the floor. So far, the user hasn't found the passkey, and the current room (Chamber) has a chest. Maybe the passkey is in the chest? But the game hasn't mentioned opening it. Alternatively, the spare room might be a different location.

The user's path has been going back and forth, so maybe they need to find a different route. The initial instructions said to go south, then east, then east, then north. The user has been going north and south between rooms, but maybe they need to check the east exit from the Chamber. The Chamber has an exit to the east, which is unguarded. Going east from the Chamber might lead to another room where the passkey is.

Alternatively, the user might need to go north from the Chamber to the Washroom again, but that's where they came from. The Washroom didn't have the passkey. The key is in the spare room, which might be the Chamber itself, but the chest is there. Maybe the passkey is in the chest, and the user needs to open it. But the game doesn't have an action for opening, so maybe the user needs to check the chest.

But the user can only move, so the next step would be to go east from the Chamber to check another room. The east exit is unguarded, so going east is the next logical step.

-= Bar =-
You arrive in a bar. A standard one.

You can make out a recliner. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.

There is an open gate leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

I never took you for the sort of person who would show up in a spare room, but I guess I was wrong.



There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

There is a passkey on the floor.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user has been navigating through various rooms in the text adventure game. The original goal was to reach the spare room and lift the passkey from the floor. 

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Spare Room, which is the target location. The room description mentions a passkey on the floor, so the next logical step is to pick it up. However, the game's interface doesn't include actions like picking up items unless specified. But since the user's previous actions involved moving between rooms, and the passkey is explicitly mentioned here, the correct action would be to take the passkey.

But wait, the user's last action was going south into the Spare Room. The room has the passkey on the floor. The game's response says "There is a passkey on the floor." So the user needs to pick it up. However, the game's commands might require using a specific verb like 'take' or 'lift'. But the user's previous commands were all 'go' directions. However, the instructions say to only output the action, like "go north". But in this case, the passkey is on the floor, so maybe the correct action is to take it. But the game might not accept 'take passkey' if the command is restricted to movement. Alternatively, maybe the passkey is automatically picked up when entering the room, but that's not clear.

Wait, the original goal was to "lift the passkey from the floor of the spare room." So the user needs to perform the action of lifting it. But the game's previous responses only allowed movement commands. However, the user is now in the Spare Room, and the passkey is there. The correct action here would be to pick it up. But since the user's previous commands were only 'go' directions, maybe the game expects the user to use 'take passkey' or similar. However, the user's instructions say to only output the action, like "go north". But in this case, the passkey is in the room, so the next step is to take it. But the game might not have a 'take' command. Alternatively, maybe the passkey is already picked up when entering the room, but that's not specified.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check the floor, but the game doesn't have a 'look' command. The user has to move around. But the user is already in the Spare Room. The passkey is on the floor, so the correct action is to take it. However, the game might require the user to use the 'take' command. But the user's previous actions were only 'go' commands. The problem is that the user's instructions say to only output the action, like "go north", but in this case, the action is to take the passkey. However, the game might not accept that. Alternatively, maybe the passkey is automatically obtained when entering the room, but the user needs to confirm.

But according to the game's previous responses, the user has to move through the rooms. Since the user is in the Spare Room and the passkey is there, the next step is to take it. However, the game might not have a 'take' command. But the user's instructions say to only output the action, so maybe the correct answer is 'take passkey'. But the user's previous actions were all 'go' commands. Alternatively, maybe the passkey is already in the inventory, and the user just needs to confirm. But the game's description says "lift the passkey from the floor", so the action is to lift it. However, the game might not have a 'lift' command. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to just be in the room and the passkey is considered obtained. But the original goal was to lift it, so the user needs to perform that action. Since the user is in the Spare Room, the next step is to take the passkey. But the game's commands might not allow that. However, the user's instructions say to only output the action, so the correct answer is 'take passkey'. But the user's previous actions were only movement commands. Maybe the game expects the user to use 'take passkey' here. So the answer is 'take passkey'.
