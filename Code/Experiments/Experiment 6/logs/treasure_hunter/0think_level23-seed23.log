Welcome to TextWorld! First stop, head south. Okay, and then, recover the passkey from the floor of the restroom. After that, make an attempt to head north. And then, make an attempt to go east. Once you get around to doing that, doublecheck that the locker within the sauna is unlocked. After you have unlocked the locker, open the locker in the sauna. Then, pick up the paper towel from the locker. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Cellar =-
I never took you for the sort of person who would show up in a cellar, but I guess I was wrong.

You can see a rack. The rack is usual. However, the rack, like an empty rack, has nothing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the rack.

There is an open door leading east. There is an unguarded exit to the south. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

-= Restroom =-
If you're wondering why everything seems so usual all of a sudden, it's because you've just walked into the restroom.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north.

There is a passkey on the floor.

Well, here we are in a sauna.

You see an opened dresser. The dresser is empty! What a waste of a day! Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a locker. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to a board. The board appears to be empty.
