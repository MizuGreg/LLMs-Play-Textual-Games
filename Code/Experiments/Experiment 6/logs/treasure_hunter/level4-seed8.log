Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an fast paced round of TextWorld? You do! Here is your task for today. Your first objective is to make an effort to move east. Okay, and then, recover the shoe from the floor of the attic. Alright, thanks!

-= Cubicle =-
You are in a cubicle. An ordinary one. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

-= Attic =-
Well, here we are in the attic.



There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

There is a latchkey and a shoe on the floor.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing a text-based game where they need to recover a shoe from the attic. So far, they've moved east from the cubicle into the attic. The current location is the attic, which has an exit to the west and items: a latchkey and a shoe on the floor.

The original goal was to recover the shoe from the attic's floor. The user has already entered the attic, so the next logical step would be to pick up the shoe. Since the shoe is on the floor, the command should be to take the shoe. The latchkey might be a red herring or useful for opening something else, but the immediate goal is the shoe. So the correct action is to take the shoe.
</think>take the shoe
