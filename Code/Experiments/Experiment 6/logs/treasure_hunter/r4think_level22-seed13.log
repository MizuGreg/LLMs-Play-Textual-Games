It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Your first objective is to make an effort to travel south. Then, make an effort to venture east. Okay, and then, venture south. With that done, make an effort to move south. Once you manage that, pick-up the keycard from the floor of the bar. That's it!

-= Cookhouse =-
You've just walked into a cookhouse. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You see a locked chest. You can make out a closed freezer here.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

-= Spare Room =-
You are in a spare room. A normal kind of place. You begin looking for stuff.

You can see a locked trunk. You see a locked locker. You can make out a stand. The stand is normal. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

There is an unblocked exit to the east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

-= Closet =-
Ah, the closet. This is some kind of closet, really great standard vibes in this place, a wonderful standard atmosphere. And now, well, you're in it.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text adventure game called TextWorld. The goal is to navigate through different rooms, move south, east, then south again, and pick up the keycard from the bar.

So far, the user has gone south from the Cookhouse into the Spare Room, then south again into the Closet. Now, they're in the Closet, which has exits to east, north, and south. The current room is the Closet, and the next step is to decide the next action.

The original plan was to go south, then east, then south again, and then get the keycard. But the user has already gone south twice. Let me check the rooms again.

In the Cookhouse, the user went south to the Spare Room. Then from there, south again to the Closet. Now, the Closet has an exit to the south, which is unblocked. So maybe the next step is to go south from the Closet. But wait, the user's next action would be to go south again, which would take them to another room. However, the original goal was to go south, then east, then south again. But the user has already done two south moves. Maybe the next step is to go east from the Closet, since the original plan was to go east after moving south twice.

Wait, the initial instructions said: first, make an effort to travel south (from Cookhouse to Spare Room), then venture east (from Spare Room to maybe another room?), then venture south again (from there to another room), then move south again, then pick up the keycard. But the user's current location is the Closet. The Closet has an exit to the east. So perhaps after going south twice, the next step is to go east, then south again. But the user is in the Closet now. Let me check the rooms again.

The Closet's description says there's an exit to the east (unguarded), north (unblocked), and south (unblocked). So the user could go east, north, or south. The original plan was to go east after moving south twice. So maybe the next step is to go east from the Closet. But the user's next action would be to go east. However, the user's previous actions were go south twice. So maybe the next step is to go east from the Closet, then south again. But the user needs to pick up the keycard from the bar. Wait, the keycard is in the bar, which is in the Cookhouse? Or maybe the bar is in a different room.

Wait, the initial instruction said: "Once you manage that, pick-up the keycard from the floor of the bar." So the keycard is in the bar. The user has to get to the bar. The initial steps were to go south from Cookhouse to Spare Room, then south to Closet. But maybe the bar is in a different room. Let me think again.

The first room was Cookhouse, which had a locked chest and a closed freezer. Then the user went south to Spare Room, which had a locked trunk, locker, and a stand. Then south to Closet. Now, the Closet has exits to east, north, south. The user needs to get to the bar. Maybe the bar is in the Spare Room? Or maybe the keycard is in the Closet? But the user needs to go to the bar. Wait, the initial instructions said to pick up the keycard from the floor of the bar. So the bar is a room where the keycard is located.

But the user hasn't reached the bar yet. So perhaps the path is: Cookhouse (south to Spare Room, then east?), but the user is in the Closet now. Maybe the user needs to go east from the Closet to reach the bar. Alternatively, maybe the bar is in the Spare Room. But the user hasn't checked there yet.

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go east from the Closet. The Closet's east exit is unguarded. So the user should go east. Then, from there, maybe they can proceed to the bar. But the user's next action is to go east. However, the user's previous steps were two souths. The original plan was to go south, then east, then south again. But the user is in the Closet now. So maybe the next step is to go east from the Closet. Then, from there, go south again to reach the bar. But the user's next action is to go east. Let me check the current room again.

In the Closet, the user can go east, north, or south. The original plan was to go east after moving south twice. So the next step is to go east. Therefore, the correct action is to go east.

-= Canteen =-
You've entered a canteen.

You make out a locked fridge.

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.



>                                                                                                                                -= Canteen =-0/4

-= Bar =-
Of every bar you could have shown up in, you had to come round an ordinary one.

You see a basket.

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

There is a keycard on the floor.
