Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First, it would be fantastic if you could try to move south. Following that, go to the east. That done, try to move south. Okay, and then, head south. After that, retrieve the key from the floor of the kitchen. Alright, thanks!

-= Salon =-
You arrive in a salon. A typical kind of place.

You scan the room for a dresser, and you find a dresser. Were you looking for a stand? Because look over there, it's a stand. On the stand you can see a grape. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing.

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.
