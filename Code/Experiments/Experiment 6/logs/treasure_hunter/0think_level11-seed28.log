Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an exciting round of TextWorld? You do! Here is your task for today. First of all, you could, like, attempt to venture west. If you can succeed at that, retrieve the passkey from the floor of the laundromat. Got that? Good!

-= Bedroom =-
You arrive in a bedroom. A typical kind of place. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You make out a portmanteau. The portmanteau is empty, what a horrible day! You can make out a closed trunk right there by you. You scan the room, seeing a bookshelf. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The bookshelf is typical. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well

You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Laundromat =-
You arrive in a laundromat. An usual one. Let's see what's in here.



There is an open portal leading north. There is an unguarded exit to the east. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

There is a passkey on the floor.
