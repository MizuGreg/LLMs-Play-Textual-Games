Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is how to play! First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to move north. Then, open the door. After that, go north. Once you get around to doing that, travel west. Next, travel south. That done, try to go west. After that, pick up the fly larva from the floor of the cookhouse. Alright, thanks!

-= Study =-
Of every study you could have walked into, you had to come round an usual one. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You see a locked coffer. You make out a trunk. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You scan the room for a stand, and you find a stand. The stand is typical. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is an open gateway leading east. There is an open gate leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is in a text-based game where they have to navigate through different rooms and complete tasks. The original instruction was to move north, open a door, go north again, west, south, then pick up the fly larva from the cookhouse. But the current scenario seems to be looping between the Study and Vault rooms.

Looking at the history, the player has been moving back and forth between Study (room 5) and Vault (room 6). The user is now at Vault again, and the prompt says to go north, which leads back to Study. The problem might be that the player is stuck in a loop without progressing towards the goal. 

The original goal was to pick up the fly larva from the cookhouse. However, in the current rooms (Study and Vault), there's no mention of a cookhouse or fly larva. The rooms described are a shower, cubicle, study, and vault. The cookhouse might be a different room that's not part of the current loop. 

The user's task is to follow the initial instructions: move north, open the door, go north, west, south, then west again to pick up the larva. But in the current path, the player hasn't reached the cookhouse. Maybe the cookhouse is in a different part of the map that's not being explored yet. 

Alternatively, the player might have missed a room or a path. The Study room has a locked coffer and a trunk, but no fly larva. The Vault has a suitcase and a counter, but again, no larva. The user needs to find the cookhouse, which might be accessible through a different route. 

Since the current movement is looping between Study and Vault, the player needs to find another way out. The Vault has an unguarded exit to the west, which might lead to a different room. Maybe the cookhouse is west of the Vault. If the player goes west from Vault, they might reach the cookhouse where the larva is located. 

So the next action should be to go west from the Vault to check if that leads to the cookhouse. If that's the case, then the player can pick up the larva. Otherwise, they might need to explore other paths. But based on the initial instructions, the user was supposed to go west after going south, which might have led to the cookhouse. However, the current path isn't reaching there. 

Therefore, the correct next step is to go west from the Vault to see if that's the way to the cookhouse and the fly larva.
</think>go west

-= Cookhouse =-
You're now in the cookhouse.

You can make out a locked case, which looks usual, in the room.

There is an open portal leading north. There is an open hatch leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a fly larva on the floor.
