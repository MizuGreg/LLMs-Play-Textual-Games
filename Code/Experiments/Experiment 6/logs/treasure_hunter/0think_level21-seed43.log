I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to go to the east. Okay, and then, venture east. Then, retrieve the tv from the floor of the salon. Got that? Good!

-= Closet =-
You are in a closet. An usual one.

You can make out a display.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

Look at you, bigshot, walking into a bar like it isn't some huge deal. The room is well lit.

You see an opened portmanteau, which looks typical, nearby. The portmanteau is empty, what a horrible day!

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

You've entered a bedchamber.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a dresser. Classic TextWorld. The dresser is empty! What a waste of a day!

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Were you looking for a basket? Because look over there, it's a basket. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a bench. The bench is usual. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You can see a board. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Look at you, bigshot, walking into a bar like it isn't some huge deal. The room is well lit.

You see an opened portmanteau, which looks typical, nearby. The portmanteau is empty, what a horrible day! If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a recliner. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a recliner? But there isn't a thing on it.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the west.
