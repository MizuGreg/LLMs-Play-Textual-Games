It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, attempt to head south. And then, attempt to venture south. Next, lift the candy bar from the floor of the garage. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Shower =-
You arrive in a shower. A typical one. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."

Oh, great. Here's a bench. But the thing is empty. Hm. Oh well

You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the south. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

-= Cubicle =-
You are in a cubicle. A standard kind of place. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You can make out a closed locker in the corner.

You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the south. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

-= Garage =-
You've just sauntered into a garage. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

There is a candy bar on the floor.
