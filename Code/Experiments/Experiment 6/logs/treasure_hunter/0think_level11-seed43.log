I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First stop, try to venture north. And then, pick up the Cat Calendar from the floor of the cubicle. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Restroom =-
I am sorry to announce that you are now in the restroom. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You scan the room for a trunk, and you find a trunk. You see a counter! Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

>                                                                                                                                -= Restroom =-0/1

-= Cubicle =-
