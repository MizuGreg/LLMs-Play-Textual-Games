It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! First thing I need you to do is to venture east. If you can get around to doing that, attempt to travel south. Following that, travel south. Then, retrieve the napkin from the floor of the scullery. Alright, thanks!

-= Shower =-
You find yourself in a shower. A typical kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

You can see a closed box in the room. You make out a locked safe.

There is an open door leading east. There is an unguarded exit to the south. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

-= Cookery =-
You are in an usual kind of place. That is to say, you're in a cookery.

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a table. On the table you can make out a stick of butter. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now.

There is an open portal leading south. There is an open door leading west.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in TextWorld. Their initial goal was to go east, then south, south again, and retrieve a napkin from the scullery. 

Starting from the shower, they went east to the cookery. Now, in the cookery, there's a portal south and a door west. The user mentioned they should try going west, but the previous action was going east. Wait, the user's first command was "go east" from the shower, which led them to the cookery. Now, in the cookery, the options are south and west.

The user's next step should be to check if moving west is the right direction. The original plan was to go east, then south, then south again. But after going east once, they're in the cookery. Maybe the next step is to go south from here. But the user's instruction said after going east, attempt to travel south. So from the cookery, moving south through the portal might be the next step. However, the user's last action was going east, and now they're in the cookery. The user's next action should be to go south. But the user's previous message said "attempt to travel south. Following that, travel south." So maybe from the cookery, going south is the next step. But the user is asking if they're on the right track. 

Wait, the user's original plan was: venture east, then south, then south again. So after going east to the cookery, the next steps would be to go south. The cookery has a portal south. So the next action should be "go south". Then, after that, maybe another south. But the user is now in the cookery, and the options are south and west. The user's next action should be to go south. But the user is asking if they're on the right track. The answer would be yes, because they're following the plan. So the next command is "go south".
</think>go south

-= Canteen =-
You are in a canteen. A standard kind of place.



There is an open portal leading north. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in TextWorld. Their original plan was to go east, then south twice, and retrieve a napkin from the scullery. So far, they've gone east from the shower into the cookery, then south to the canteen.

Now, in the canteen, there's an open portal north and an unguarded exit south. The user's next step should probably be to go south again, following their initial plan. But wait, the goal is to get to the scullery's floor to get the napkin. Let me check the previous rooms. The shower had an east exit to cookery, then south to canteen. Maybe the scullery is further south? But the canteen has a south exit. So going south from canteen would be the next step. The user's plan was to go south twice after east. So after cookery (which was east from shower), they went south to canteen. Now, going south again from canteen would be the second south, leading towards the scullery. Then, once there, they can retrieve the napkin. So the next action should be go south.
</think>go south

-= Scullery =-
You arrive in a scullery. A standard one.

You make out a closed refrigerator here.

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

There is a napkin on the floor.

Okay, let's see. The user's original goal was to retrieve the napkin from the scullery. They've already reached the scullery, and the napkin is on the floor. The previous actions were going east, then south, then south again, which led them to the scullery. Now, they're in the scullery, and the napkin is present. The next logical step is to pick up the napkin. The command should be "take napkin" or something similar. But the user's instructions say to only output the action, like "go north". So the correct command here is to take the napkin. Let me check the environment again. The scullery has the napkin on the floor. So the action is to take it. The user's last input was in the scullery, so the next step is to take the napkin.
</think>take napkin
