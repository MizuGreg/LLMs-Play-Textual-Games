You are now playing a exciting episode of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First off, make an attempt to venture east. If you can succeed at that, attempt to take a trip east. And then, recover the keycard from the floor of the workshop. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Cubicle =-
You are in a cubicle. An usual kind of place.



There is an open wooden passageway leading east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing a text adventure game. They started in a cubicle, went east into a laundromat. Now they're in the laundromat, with a gateway east and a passageway west. The original goal was to recover the keycard from the workshop and then win.

So far, the user has moved east once, from the cubicle to the laundromat. The next step would be to check if there's a way to get to the workshop. The laundromat's description mentions a gateway east and a west passageway. Maybe the workshop is east of the laundromat? But the user hasn't found the keycard yet. The keycard is on the floor of the workshop, so they need to get there.

In the initial instructions, after going east from the cubicle, the next step was to take a trip east again. But the user is now in the laundromat. Maybe the workshop is east of the laundromat. So the next action should be to go east again. But the user needs to check if that's possible. The laundromat's description says there's an open wooden gateway leading east, so that's a valid direction. So the next step is to go east again. Then, once in the workshop, look for the keycard on the floor. Then pick it up and win. So the next command is go east.

-= Workshop =-
You are in a workshop. A standard kind of place. The room is well lit.



There is an open stone gate leading east. There is an open wooden gateway leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked.

There is a keycard on the floor.

Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user has been moving east through different locations: first the cubicle, then the laundromat, and now the workshop. The goal was to recover the keycard from the floor of the workshop and then win. 

In the workshop, there's a keycard on the floor. The previous steps involved moving east, which led to the workshop. Now, the keycard is here, so the next logical step is to pick it up. The user's next action should be to take the keycard.

The user's instruction says to only output the action, so the correct command here is "take keycard". That's the right move to progress towards the goal.
</think>take keycard
