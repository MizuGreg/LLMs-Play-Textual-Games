You are now playing a life changing round of TextWorld! First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to try to move south. Then, head south. Then, attempt to head south. Okay, and then, take a trip west. After that, recover the sandwich from the floor of the closet. Alright, thanks!

-= Steam Room =-
If you're wondering why everything seems so normal all of a sudden, it's because you've just walked into the steam room.

You can see a bench. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a board. The board is ordinary. But there isn't a thing on it. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. The table is chipped. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm. Oh well

There is an unguarded exit to the south. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

You are in a closet. A normal kind of place. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

There is a sandwich on the floor.
