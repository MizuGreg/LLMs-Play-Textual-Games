Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First stop, make an effort to go west. And then, lift the carrot from the floor of the chamber. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Bedchamber =-
Well, here we are in the bedchamber.



There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

-= Chamber =-
Okay, so you're in a chamber, cool, but is it usual? You better believe it is. You begin looking for stuff.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a carrot on the floor.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user has been moving through different rooms in TextWorld. The first action was going west from the Bedchamber, which led to the Chamber. Now, in the Chamber, there's a carrot on the floor. The task was to lift the carrot from the floor of the chamber. So the next logical step is to pick up the carrot.

The user is asking if they're making the right actions and if they're close to the goal. The current location is the Chamber, and the carrot is there. So the correct action would be to take the carrot. The previous steps were moving west, which was the first part of the task. Now, lifting the carrot is the next step. The user needs to execute "take carrot" or "lift carrot" depending on the game's command set. Since the game mentions "lift the carrot from the floor," maybe "lift" is the correct verb. But often in text games, "take" is used. However, the exact command might depend on the game's design. The user's previous action was "go west," so following that pattern, the next action should be "lift carrot" or "take carrot." The response should be the command only, so "lift carrot" or "take carrot." Given the task says "lift the carrot," maybe "lift" is better. But I need to check the game's possible commands. Since the user is in the Chamber and the carrot is on the floor, the correct action is to pick it up. So the next command is "lift carrot."

That's not a verb I recognise.

Okay, the user tried to lift the carrot but the game said that's not a recognized verb. Hmm, maybe the correct command is different. Let me check the previous interactions.

First, the user was in the Bedchamber, went west, then ended up in the Chamber. The Chamber has a carrot on the floor. The task was to lift the carrot. But the game didn't accept "lift carrot". Maybe the correct verb is "take" instead of "lift"? In many text adventures, "take" is the standard command for picking up items. Let me confirm the possible commands. The user's previous action was "go west", which worked. Then, trying "lift carrot" failed. So perhaps the correct command is "take carrot". I should try that. Also, the user needs to make sure they're in the right location. Since they are in the Chamber now, "take carrot" should work. Let me output that.
