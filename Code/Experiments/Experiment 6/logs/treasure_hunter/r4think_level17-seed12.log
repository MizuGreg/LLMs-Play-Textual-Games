Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is how to play! First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to move north. Then, open the door. After that, go north. Once you get around to doing that, travel west. Next, travel south. That done, try to go west. After that, pick up the fly larva from the floor of the cookhouse. Alright, thanks!

-= Study =-
Of every study you could have walked into, you had to come round an usual one. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You see a locked coffer. You make out a trunk. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You scan the room for a stand, and you find a stand. The stand is typical. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is an open gateway leading east. There is an open gate leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

You see a suitcase. You make out a counter. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the counter.

You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game called TextWorld, and they've been following a set of instructions to move through different rooms. The goal mentioned earlier was to pick up the fly larva from the cookhouse and put it in a place. 

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Study room again after moving north from the Vault. The previous steps involved moving through several rooms: Bedroom → Shower → Cubicle → Vault → Study. The next step was supposed to be going west from the Study, but the user went south instead, which brought them back to the Study. 

Now, the user is asking if they're making the right actions and if they're close to the goal. The key here is to check if they've encountered the cookhouse yet. The initial instructions mentioned going to the cookhouse to pick up the fly larva. However, in the rooms they've visited so far (Bedroom, Shower, Cubicle, Vault, Study), there's no mention of a cookhouse. The cookhouse might be a different room that hasn't been explored yet.

The user's current position is the Study. The Study has a locked coffer, a trunk, a stand, and exits to east, west, and south. The next logical step would be to check if there's a way to get to the cookhouse. Since the user hasn't found the cookhouse yet, they might need to explore other paths. The exits from the Study are east, west, and south. Going south leads back to the Study, so that's not helpful. Maybe going east or west could lead to other rooms. 

But the user's last action was going south, which just brought them back. The next action should be to try going west again from the Study. The Study's west exit is open, so moving west might lead to another room. If that room is the cookhouse, then they can pick up the fly larva. Alternatively, if the cookhouse is in a different direction, they might need to explore further.

The user's goal is to pick up the fly larva, so they need to find the cookhouse. Since the current path hasn't reached it yet, the next step should be to continue exploring the Study's west exit. The user might be on the right track, but they need to keep moving through the rooms until they find the cookhouse. The answer should be to go west from the Study to proceed further.

-= Launderette =-
You arrive in a launderette. A typical kind of place.

You can see a bench. The bench is ordinary. However, the bench, like an empty bench, has nothing on it.

There is an open gate leading east. There is an open portal leading south. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

You find yourself in a salon. A normal kind of place. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

Look over there! a safe. The safe is empty! What a waste of a day! You can make out a bar. The bar is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Launderette and Salon. They keep going back and forth between these two rooms. The original goal was to pick up the fly larva from the cookhouse. So far, the user hasn't encountered the cookhouse yet. The path they've taken so far is Bedroom → Shower → Cubicle → Vault → Study → Launderette → Salon → Launderette → Salon. They need to find the cookhouse.

Looking at the rooms they've visited, the cookhouse hasn't been mentioned. The user might be going in circles. The next step should be to check if there's another exit from the Salon that leads to a different room. The Salon has an exit to the east, which leads back to the Launderette. Maybe there's another direction they haven't explored yet. Wait, the Salon's description mentions a safe and a bar, but no mention of a cookhouse. The user needs to find the cookhouse, which might be in a different part of the map.

Alternatively, maybe the cookhouse is in the Vault or Study. But the Vault had a suitcase and a counter, and the Study had a locked coffer. The user hasn't opened any of those yet. Maybe they need to check the locked coffer in the Study. But the user hasn't been there since the Vault. Wait, the user was in the Study earlier, but then went to the Launderette and Salon. Maybe they need to go back to the Study and try to open the coffer.

But the current position is the Launderette again. The user is stuck in a loop. The next action should be to try going south from the Launderette, as the description mentions an open portal leading south. Maybe that leads to a different room. Let's check: the Launderette has an open gate east and an open portal south. Going south might lead to a new room, perhaps the cookhouse. If not, then maybe the user needs to find another way.

Alternatively, maybe the cookhouse is in the Vault. The user should go back to the Vault and check the suitcase or counter. But the user is currently in the Launderette. The path back to the Vault would be through the Study, then Vault. But the user is stuck in the loop. The next step should be to go south from the Launderette to see if that leads to the cookhouse. If not, then maybe the user needs to find another way. But according to the game's structure, the user needs to continue exploring until they find the cookhouse. So the next action is to go south from the Launderette.

-= Cookhouse =-
You're now in the cookhouse.

You can make out a locked case, which looks usual, in the room.

There is an open portal leading north. There is an open hatch leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a fly larva on the floor.
