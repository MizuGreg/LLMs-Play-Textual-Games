Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, make an attempt to take a trip south. With that done, venture east. After that, retrieve the frisbee from the floor of the closet. That's it!

-= Pantry =-
You've entered a pantry. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You scan the room for a safe, and you find a safe. The safe is empty, what a horrible day!

There is an open gate leading south. There is an unguarded exit to the east. There is an unblocked exit to the north. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

-= Cookery =-
You are in a cookery. An ordinary kind of place. Let's see what's in here.

You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a rack. You wonder idly who left that here. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well

There is an open gate leading north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. There is an unguarded exit to the south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.
