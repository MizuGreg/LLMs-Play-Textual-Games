Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, make an attempt to take a trip south. With that done, venture east. After that, retrieve the frisbee from the floor of the closet. That's it!

-= Pantry =-
You've entered a pantry. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You scan the room for a safe, and you find a safe. The safe is empty, what a horrible day!

There is an open gate leading south. There is an unguarded exit to the east. There is an unblocked exit to the north. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

-= Cookery =-
You are in a cookery. An ordinary kind of place. Let's see what's in here.

You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a rack. You wonder idly who left that here. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well

There is an open gate leading north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. There is an unguarded exit to the south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and retrieve a frisbee from a closet. The current room is the Cookery, and the user has already gone south from the Pantry. Now, the user is in the Cookery, and the next steps are to venture east, then retrieve the frisbee from the closet.

Looking at the current room description, the Cookery has exits to north, south, east, and west. The user's previous action was going south, which led them here. The next step according to the initial instruction was to venture east. So the user should go east from the Cookery. The room description mentions an unguarded exit to the east, so that's a valid move. The user needs to proceed east to continue their journey towards the closet where the frisbee is located. The user should follow the directions step by step, making sure to move in the correct order: south, then east, then retrieve the frisbee. The next action should be to go east.
</think>go east

-= Closet =-
You find yourself in a closet. A normal kind of place.



There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

There is a frisbee on the floor.


>                                                                                                                                -= Closet =-0/3

Okay, let's see. The user is in a closet and there's a frisbee on the floor. The original goal was to retrieve the frisbee from the closet's floor. So the next step should be to pick up the frisbee. The previous actions were going south, then east, which led to the closet. Now, the frisbee is here, so the command should be to take the frisbee. But the system only allows commands like 'take frisbee' or similar. Wait, the user's last action was entering the closet, and the frisbee is on the floor. So the correct action is to take the frisbee. The response should be "take frisbee".
</think>take frisbee
