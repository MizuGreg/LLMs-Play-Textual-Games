You are now playing a fast paced game of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First off, make an effort to venture north. With that done, try to go to the north. With that done, go east. And then, venture north. Then, take a trip north. Then, go west. That done, retrieve the stick of butter from the floor of the kitchenette. That's it!

-= Cookery =-
You've just sauntered into a cookery.

You scan the room for a chest, and you find a chest. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? Look over there! a platter. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You can make out a saucepan. The saucepan is typical. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north.

-= Scullery =-
You find yourself in a scullery. A standard one.

Hey, want to see a fridge? Look over there, a fridge. The fridge is empty, what a horrible day! You can make out a bowl. The bowl is typical. The bowl appears to be empty. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

-= Cellar =-
You are in an usual kind of place. That is to say, you're in a cellar. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a rack. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing hasn't got anything on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the rack. You can make out a workbench. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Hm. Oh well

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

-= Office =-
You find yourself in an office. A typical kind of place.

A closed coffer is right there by you.

There is an open door leading east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.



>                                                                                                                                -= Office =-0/4

-= Pantry =-
You arrive in a pantry. A standard kind of place.

You scan the room for a stand, and you find a stand. The stand is typical. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.

There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this TextWorld game and has followed a series of directions to move through different rooms. The original task was to venture north, then go east, then north again, then take a trip north, then west, and finally retrieve the stick of butter from the kitchenette.

So far, the user has gone north from the Cookery to the Scullery, then north again to the Cellar, east to the Office, and north to the Pantry. Now, they're in the Pantry. The next step according to the initial instructions was to go west. But the user hasn't done that yet. The current room is the Pantry, which has exits to north, south, and west. The user's next move should be to go west, as per the original plan. Then, after reaching the previous room (which would be the Office), they need to retrieve the stick of butter from the kitchenette. But the user hasn't mentioned finding the butter yet. However, the current task is to follow the steps given. The user's last action was going north to the Pantry, and the next step is to go west. So the correct command here is "go west".
</think>go west

-= Canteen =-
You are in a canteen. An usual kind of place.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a shelf. But there isn't a thing on it.

There is an unguarded exit to the east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.



>                                                                                                                                -= Canteen =-0/6

-= Kitchenette =-
Well, here we are in a kitchenette.

You can make out a locked cabinet close by.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

There is a stick of butter on the floor.


>                                                                                                                                -= Kitchenette =-0/7
Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me recap the user's progress. The original goal was to retrieve the stick of butter from the kitchenette. The user has followed the steps: ventured north, went east, north again, then north again, then west. Now they're in the Kitchenette, where the stick of butter is on the floor. The next step should be to pick up the butter. But the game's current state shows that the user is in the Kitchenette, and the stick is on the floor. The command should be to take the stick of butter. However, in TextWorld, sometimes you need to use specific commands like 'take' or 'get'. The user's previous actions were all 'go' commands, so maybe the next step is to 'take stick of butter'. But the user's instruction says to only output the action, so the correct command here is 'take stick of butter'.
</think>take stick of butter
