Welcome to another fast paced episode of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. Your first objective is to doublecheck that the door in the studio is open. Then, make an attempt to venture north. With that accomplished, pick up the potato from the floor of the salon. Got that? Good!

-= Studio =-
You arrive in a studio. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."

A closed suitcase is close by. You make out a coffer.

There is a closed door leading north. There is an open portal leading south.

-= Salon =-
Guess what, you are in the place we're calling the salon.

You make out a bookshelf. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

There is an open door leading south. There is an open gate leading east.

There is a potato on the floor.
