Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to ensure that the portal is open. After that, go to the north. After that, go to the west. And then, make an effort to head north. And then, travel east. After that, retrieve the butterfly from the box within the workshop. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Laundromat =-
You've entered a laundromat.

You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a rack. The rack is typical. But the thing is empty.

There is a closed portal leading north. There is an open gate leading south.
