Welcome to another exciting game of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to open the portal. And then, head west. Next, make an attempt to travel north. And then, try to take a trip west. Then, venture west. And then, pick-up the chocolate bar from the floor of the workshop. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Cookhouse =-
You arrive in a cookhouse. A standard kind of place.

You make out a chair. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is a closed portal leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they need to open a portal and navigate through certain directions. The current challenge is that the portal is closed, so they can't go west yet. The user tried going west first, but the game responded that they need to open the portal first.

So, the next logical step is to figure out how to open the portal. Since the portal is closed, maybe there's a way to interact with it. The user might need to use a specific command like 'open portal' or 'use key' if a key is nearby. But in the current description, there's no mention of a key. The user is in the cookhouse, which has a chair and a closed portal west. The game's message says they need to open the portal first.

The user's previous action was 'go west', which was invalid because the portal was closed. Now, the correct action should be to attempt to open the portal. The game might expect the command 'open portal' or something similar. Since the user is instructed to only output the action, the correct response here is to try opening the portal. That makes sense because without opening it, they can't proceed west. So the next command should be 'open portal'.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they need to open a portal and then navigate west several times to pick up a chocolate bar. So far, they tried going west first, but the portal was closed. Then they opened the portal, which allowed them to proceed.

Now, the next step after opening the portal would be to go west again, as per the original instructions. The user's next action should be "go west" to move through the now-open portal. Since the portal is unblocked, moving west is possible. The goal is to eventually reach the workshop and pick up the chocolate bar, so continuing west makes sense. The user needs to follow the sequence: open portal, go west, then proceed north and west again as mentioned. So the correct command here is "go west".

-= Lounge =-
You've just shown up in a lounge.

You see a bed. The bed appears to be empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the bed.

There is an open portal leading east. There is an open gate leading west. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through these different rooms in the game. The original goal was to open the portal, then go west, north, west again, and pick up the chocolate bar.

So far, they started in the Cookhouse, opened the portal, went west to the Lounge. Now in the Lounge, there's an open portal east and a gate west. The提示 says to try going north. The user's next action should be to go north. But wait, the user's previous action was go west, which led them to the Lounge. Now, the prompt says "You should try going north." So the correct next step is to go north. The user needs to follow the directions given in the environment description. The answer should be "go north".

You've moved into an ordinary room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be ordinary. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the recreation zone.

You can make out a bookshelf. The bookshelf is ordinary. But there isn't a thing on it. You can see a bar. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the bar.

There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text adventure game. The goal is to open the portal, go west, then north, then west again, pick up the chocolate bar, and win.

So far, the user has opened the portal in the Cookhouse and went west to the Lounge. Then they went north to the Recreation Zone. Now, the next step according to the original instructions was to venture west again. The current location is the Recreation Zone, which has an exit to the south and a west direction. The prompt says "You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west." So the next action should be to go west. That makes sense because the user is following the sequence: after going north in the Recreation Zone, the next step is west. Then, after that, they need to pick up the chocolate bar. But right now, the immediate next step is to go west from the Recreation Zone. So the correct command here is "go west".

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a cabinet. You can make out a saucepan. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Okay, let's see. The user has been navigating through different rooms in this text-based game. The goal is to open the portal, go west, then north, west again, and finally pick up the chocolate bar from the workshop.

So far, they've opened the portal in the Cookhouse, gone west to the Lounge, then north to the Recreation Zone, and west again to the Kitchenette. Now, they're in the Kitchenette, and the next step according to the original instructions was to pick up the chocolate bar from the workshop. But the current room is the Kitchenette, which doesn't mention a chocolate bar. The previous rooms were Cookhouse, Lounge, Recreation Zone, Kitchenette. The workshop hasn't been mentioned yet. 

Wait, the user's task included going west from the Recreation Zone, which led to the Kitchenette. But the chocolate bar is in the workshop. So maybe the workshop is another room they need to explore. The current room is the Kitchenette, which has an exit to the east (unguarded) and west (unguarded). The user needs to find the workshop. Maybe the workshop is east or west from the Kitchenette? The Kitchenette's description says there's a cabinet and a saucepan, but no chocolate bar. 

The next logical step would be to check the east or west exits. Since the user was told to go west from the Recreation Zone, maybe the workshop is in another direction. But the current room is Kitchenette. The user needs to find the chocolate bar. Since the workshop is mentioned in the original task, perhaps the workshop is accessible from the Kitchenette. Maybe the user needs to go east from the Kitchenette to reach the workshop. Alternatively, maybe the workshop is in the west direction. But the user has already been going west a few times. 

Alternatively, maybe the chocolate bar is in the Kitchenette, but the description doesn't mention it. The user might need to look around. But according to the game's structure, the chocolate bar is in the workshop. So the user needs to find the workshop. The current room is Kitchenette, which has an exit to the east. So the next action should be to go east to reach the workshop. Then, once in the workshop, pick up the chocolate bar. 

Therefore, the next command should be "go east" to move towards the workshop.

Okay, let's see. The user is navigating through different rooms in a text-based game. The goal is to open the portal, go west, then north, west again, and finally pick up the chocolate bar from the workshop.

So far, the user has opened the portal and gone west through several rooms: Cookhouse, Lounge, Recreation Zone, Kitchenette, and back to Recreation Zone. The current room is the Recreation Zone again. The next step mentioned in the original task was to "pick-up the chocolate bar from the floor of the workshop." But the user hasn't encountered the workshop yet.

In the current Recreation Zone, the exits are south and west. The user has been moving west repeatedly. Maybe the workshop is in a different direction. Wait, the initial instructions said after going west, try north, then west again. But the user might have missed a direction. Alternatively, maybe the workshop is in the east or north direction of the current room. However, in the Recreation Zone, the description mentions a bookshelf and a bar, but no workshop. The user needs to find the workshop to get the chocolate bar.

Since the user is in the Recreation Zone, perhaps the next step is to check the north or east directions. But the current room's exits are south and west. The user might need to go south to exit the Recreation Zone and find another path. Alternatively, maybe the workshop is in the east direction of the Kitchenette, but the user was in the Recreation Zone now. Wait, the previous move was go east from Kitchenette, which brought them back to Recreation Zone. So maybe the workshop is in another direction. Alternatively, perhaps the user needs to go west from Recreation Zone again. But the user has been going west multiple times. Maybe the workshop is in the south direction? But the south exit is unguarded. Wait, the original task said to go west, then north, then west again. Maybe the user needs to go north from Recreation Zone. But in the Recreation Zone's description, the exit to the south is unguarded, and the user is told to try going west. However, the user might need to check other directions. Alternatively, maybe the workshop is in the east direction of the Recreation Zone. But the user hasn't checked that yet. The user's next action should be to go north or east to find the workshop. But according to the current room's description, the exits are south and west. So perhaps the user needs to go south to exit the Recreation Zone and proceed further. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check the north direction again. Wait, the user is in the Recreation Zone, and the description says "You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west." So the suggested direction is west. But the user has already been going west. Maybe the workshop is in the west direction of the Recreation Zone. However, the user hasn't found it yet. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east from the Recreation Zone. But the current room's description doesn't mention an east exit. Wait, when the user was in the Kitchenette, they could go east to return to Recreation Zone. So perhaps the workshop is in another room. The user needs to find the workshop to pick up the chocolate bar. Since the user hasn't found it yet, maybe the next step is to check the north direction from the Recreation Zone. But the current room's description doesn't mention a north exit. Wait, the user is in the Recreation Zone, and the description says "There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west." So the exits are south and west. Therefore, the user should try going west again. But the user has already done that. Maybe the workshop is in the west direction, but the user hasn't reached it yet. So the next action would be to go west again. But the user is already in the Recreation Zone. Wait, the user's last move was go east from Kitchenette to Recreation Zone. Now, the next step is to go west from Recreation Zone. But the user might need to go north or south. However, the current room's description suggests trying west. So the user should go west again. But the user might be stuck in a loop. Alternatively, maybe the workshop is in the south direction. The user could try going south from Recreation Zone. But the description says "You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west." So the user should follow that advice. Therefore, the next action is to go west.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and eventually pick up the chocolate bar. The current room is the Kitchenette, and they've been moving back and forth between the Recreation Zone and the Kitchenette.

The user's last action was "go west", which took them back to the Kitchenette. Now, the prompt says to decide the next action. The goal is to pick up the chocolate bar from the workshop, so I need to check if the chocolate bar is in the current room or if there's a path to the workshop.

Looking at the previous rooms: the Cookhouse had a portal, then the Lounge, Recreation Zone, Kitchenette. The user has been moving west and east between these rooms. The original task mentioned going west from the Cookhouse, then north, west, etc., and picking up the chocolate bar in the workshop.

Wait, the user hasn't mentioned the workshop yet. The current room is the Kitchenette. The previous rooms included the Recreation Zone, which had a bookshelf and a bar. The Kitchenette has a cabinet and a saucepan. The user needs to find the workshop where the chocolate bar is.

Maybe the workshop is another room connected via the exits. The user has been moving west and east, but perhaps they need to go north from the Kitchenette? Wait, in the Kitchenette description, the exits are east and west. The user tried going east, which brought them back to the Recreation Zone. Maybe the workshop is in a different direction. Alternatively, maybe the chocolate bar is in the Kitchenette, but the description says the saucepan is empty. The user hasn't picked anything up yet.

Wait, the original task said to "pick-up the chocolate bar from the floor of the workshop." So the workshop is a separate room. The user needs to find the workshop. So far, the user has been moving through different rooms but hasn't reached the workshop. The current room is the Kitchenette. The exits here are east and west. Going east leads back to the Recreation Zone. Going west leads back to the Kitchenette? Wait, no, the user was in the Kitchenette, then went east to Recreation Zone, then west back to Kitchenette. Maybe the workshop is connected via another exit. But in the current room, the exits are east and west. Maybe the user needs to go north from the Kitchenette? But the description doesn't mention a north exit. Wait, in the Kitchenette description, it says "You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the west." So the exits are east and west. So the user can't go north here.

Hmm. Maybe the workshop is in the Recreation Zone? But the Recreation Zone has a bookshelf and a bar, but no mention of a workshop. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go back to the Lounge or Cookhouse. But the user's current position is the Kitchenette. The previous steps were: Cookhouse -> Lounge -> Recreation Zone -> Kitchenette -> Recreation Zone -> Kitchenette.

Wait, the user's goal is to pick up the chocolate bar in the workshop. So the user needs to find the workshop. Maybe the workshop is in the Lounge? Or maybe the user needs to go through the portal again. But the portal was opened in the Cookhouse. The user has already opened the portal and went west, but that led to the Lounge. Then they went north to Recreation Zone, then west to Kitchenette. Maybe the workshop is in the Lounge? But the Lounge description doesn't mention a workshop. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go back to the Cookhouse and use the portal again. But the portal is already open.

Alternatively, maybe the chocolate bar is in the Kitchenette. The user hasn't picked anything up yet. The Kitchenette has a cabinet and a saucepan. Maybe the chocolate bar is in the cabinet? The user needs to check the cabinet. But the user hasn't interacted with the cabinet yet. The previous actions were moving between rooms, but not checking objects. So maybe the next step is to check the cabinet in the Kitchenette.

But the user's instructions say to only output the action, like "go north". The user hasn't been told to check the cabinet. The original task was to pick up the chocolate bar from the workshop. So the user needs to find the workshop. Maybe the workshop is in the Recreation Zone? Or perhaps the user needs to go back to the Cookhouse and find the workshop there. But the Cookhouse's description didn't mention a workshop.

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go west from the Kitchenette again, but that's the same room. Wait, the user is in the Kitchenette, and the exits are east and west. Going west would take them back to the Kitchenette? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, the user was in the Kitchenette, then went east to Recreation Zone, then west back to Kitchenette. So the exits are east and west, but going west from Kitchenette leads back to the same room? That can't be. Maybe there's a mistake in the room descriptions. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go north from the Kitchenette, but the description doesn't mention that.

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to check the cabinet in the Kitchenette. The user hasn't done that yet. The instruction says to pick up the chocolate bar from the workshop. If the workshop is in the Kitchenette, maybe the chocolate bar is there. But the description says the saucepan is empty. The cabinet is mentioned, but the user hasn't interacted with it. So maybe the next action is to check the cabinet. But the user's previous actions were moving between rooms. The user hasn't picked up any items yet. So the next step might be to check the cabinet.

But according to the game's structure, the user is supposed to move through the rooms. The user's current room is the Kitchenette. The exits are east and west. The user has been moving back and forth. The user needs to find the workshop. Maybe the workshop is in the Lounge? But the Lounge's description doesn't mention it. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go back to the Cookhouse and find the workshop there. But the Cookhouse's description didn't mention a workshop.

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go north from the Kitchenette, but the description doesn't mention that. The user's last action was "go west" which brought them back to the Kitchenette. The current room is the Kitchenette again. The user needs to find the workshop. Maybe the workshop is in the Recreation Zone? But the Recreation Zone's description doesn't mention it. 

This is confusing. The user needs to pick up the chocolate bar from the workshop. The user hasn't found the workshop yet. The previous rooms don't mention a workshop. Maybe the workshop is in the Lounge? Or maybe the user needs to go back to the Cookhouse and use the portal again. But the portal was already opened. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to check the cabinet in the Kitchenette. The user hasn't done that yet. The cabinet is mentioned, so maybe the chocolate bar is in there. The user needs to open the cabinet. But the user hasn't interacted with it. So the next action should be to check the cabinet. But the user's previous actions were moving between rooms, not interacting with objects. 

In the game's context, the user is supposed to move through the rooms and pick up items. The user hasn't picked up anything yet. The chocolate bar is in the workshop. The user needs to find the workshop. Since the user is in the Kitchenette, maybe the workshop is connected via the east exit to the Recreation Zone. But the Recreation Zone doesn't mention a workshop. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go back to the Lounge and then to the Cookhouse. But the user has already been there. 

This is tricky. The user's next action should be to check the cabinet in the Kitchenette, but the user hasn't done that yet. The user's previous actions were moving between rooms, so maybe the next step is to check the cabinet. But the user's instructions say to only output the action. So the correct action here is to check the cabinet. But in the game's context, the user might need to go to the workshop first. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go west from the Kitchenette again, but that's the same room. So that's not possible. 

Wait, the user is in the Kitchenette. The exits are east and west. The user tried going east to Recreation Zone, then west back to Kitchenette. So the user is stuck in a loop. The user needs to find a way to the workshop. Maybe the workshop is in the Recreation Zone. But the Recreation Zone's description doesn't mention it. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go north from the Kitchenette, but the description doesn't mention that. 

Hmm. The user's task is to pick up the chocolate bar from the workshop. The user hasn't found the workshop yet. The current room is the Kitchenette. The user needs to find the workshop. Since the user is in the Kitchenette, maybe the workshop is connected via the east exit to the Recreation Zone. But the Recreation Zone doesn't mention it. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go back to the Cookhouse and find the workshop there. But the Cookhouse's description didn't mention a workshop. 

This is confusing. The user might need to check the cabinet in the Kitchenette. So the next action is to check the cabinet. But the user hasn't done that yet. The user's previous actions were moving between rooms, so the next action should be to check the cabinet. But the user's instructions say to only output the action. So the answer is to check the cabinet. However, the game's commands might require the user to interact with the cabinet. But the user hasn't been told to do that. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go back to the Lounge and then to the Cookhouse. But the user is in the Kitchenette. 

I think the correct next action is to check the cabinet in the Kitchenette. So the user should type "open cabinet" or "check cabinet". But the user's previous actions were moving between rooms, so maybe the next step is to check the cabinet. However, the game's commands might require the user to use specific verbs. The user's previous actions were "go west", "go north", etc. So maybe the next action is to check the cabinet. But the user hasn't been told to do that yet. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go back to the Cookhouse and use the portal again. But the portal is already open. 

This is a bit of a puzzle. The user needs to find the workshop. The user is in the Kitchenette. The exits are east and west. The user has been moving back and forth. The user needs to find the workshop. Maybe the workshop is in the Lounge. But the Lounge's description doesn't mention it. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go north from the Kitchenette, but the description doesn't mention that. 

I think the user needs to check the cabinet in the Kitchenette. So the next action is to check the cabinet. But the user's previous actions were moving between rooms. So the answer is to check the cabinet.
</think>open cabinet
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The cabinet is welded shut.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through these different rooms in the game. The goal is to open the portal, go west, then north, west again, and pick up the chocolate bar from the workshop.

So far, they've opened the portal in the Cookhouse and gone west to the Lounge. Then they went north to the Recreation Zone, west again to the Kitchenette, and then east back to the Recreation Zone. Now they're in the Kitchenette again, and they tried to open the cabinet, but it's welded shut. 

The next step would be to figure out what to do next. Since the cabinet is closed, maybe they can't open it. The user's last action was "open cabinet", which didn't work. The current room is the Kitchenette, which has an exit to the east and west. The user has been moving back and forth between the Recreation Zone and Kitchenette.

The original plan was to go west from the Cookhouse, then north, then west again, and then pick up the chocolate bar. But maybe the chocolate bar is in the Kitchenette? Or perhaps in the Recreation Zone? The user needs to find the workshop where the chocolate bar is.

Alternatively, maybe the correct path is to keep moving west from the Recreation Zone. But the user is stuck in the Kitchenette. Since the cabinet is welded shut, they can't open it. So maybe they need to try another exit. The Kitchenette has an exit to the west, which would take them back to the Recreation Zone. But they've already been there. Maybe they need to go east again to the Recreation Zone and then try another direction.

Wait, the user's last action was in the Kitchenette, and they tried to open the cabinet. Since that didn't work, the next step would be to check the other exits. The Kitchenette has an exit to the west and east. They tried east before, which led back to the Recreation Zone. Maybe they should try going west again from the Kitchenette, but that would take them back to the Recreation Zone again. But the user might need to explore the Recreation Zone more thoroughly.

Alternatively, maybe the chocolate bar is in the Kitchenette, but it's not mentioned. The user needs to look for it. But the description of the Kitchenette mentions a saucepan, but it's empty. The cabinet is closed. So maybe the chocolate bar is in another room. The user needs to continue moving through the rooms, trying different directions until they find the workshop.

So the next action should be to go west from the Kitchenette, which would take them back to the Recreation Zone. Then perhaps try going west again from there. But the user has already been in the Recreation Zone. Maybe they need to go south from the Recreation Zone, but the exit is unguarded. Wait, in the Recreation Zone, the exit to the south is unguarded. So maybe going south from there would lead to another room. But the user hasn't tried that yet.

Alternatively, maybe the correct path is to go west from the Recreation Zone again, but the user is stuck in the Kitchenette. So the next step is to go west from the Kitchenette to the Recreation Zone again, then try going south. But the user has to follow the original plan: after going west, north, west, then pick up the chocolate bar. Maybe the chocolate bar is in the Kitchenette, but it's not mentioned. Or perhaps in the Workshop, which is another room.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to find the Workshop. The original goal was to pick up the chocolate bar from the workshop. So the user needs to find the Workshop. The current path has them in the Kitchenette. Maybe the Workshop is in the Recreation Zone or another room. The user needs to continue exploring.

But the user's last action was in the Kitchenette, trying to open the cabinet. Since that didn't work, the next step is to try another exit. The Kitchenette has an exit to the west and east. The user tried east, which led back to the Recreation Zone. So maybe they should go west again from the Kitchenette, back to the Recreation Zone, then try going south from there. But the user needs to follow the original plan: after going west, north, west, then pick up the chocolate bar. So maybe the chocolate bar is in the Recreation Zone or the Kitchenette.

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go west from the Recreation Zone again, but that's already been done. The user is stuck in the Kitchenette, so the next action should be to go west to the Recreation Zone again, then try going south. But the user needs to check the directions again.

In the Recreation Zone, the exit to the south is unguarded. So maybe going south from the Recreation Zone would lead to the Workshop. The user needs to try that. So the next step is to go west from the Kitchenette to the Recreation Zone, then go south. But the user is in the Kitchenette, so the next action is to go west.

Okay, let's see. The user has been navigating through different rooms in the game. The goal is to open the portal, go west, then north, west again, and pick up the chocolate bar from the workshop. So far, they've opened the portal, gone west through the lounge, recreation zone, kitchenette, and now they're in the workshop.

In the workshop, there's a chocolate bar on the floor. The next step according to the original task was to pick up the chocolate bar. The user's last action was going west, which led them to the workshop. Now, they need to pick up the chocolate bar. The prompt mentions that if they do that, they're the winner. So the correct action here is to take the chocolate bar. The previous steps have been correctly followed, and now the final action is to pick up the chocolate bar. The user should say "take chocolate bar" to complete the task.
