I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First thing I need you to do is to make an effort to take a trip east. Then, go to the south. Then, try to go to the south. And then, head south. Then, recover the key from the floor of the playroom. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Studio =-
Ah, the studio. This is some kind of studio, really great usual vibes in this place, a wonderful usual atmosphere. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You make out a shelf. The shelf is normal. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the north. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.
