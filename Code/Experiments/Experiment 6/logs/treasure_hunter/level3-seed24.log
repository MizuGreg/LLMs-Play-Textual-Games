It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! First of all, move north. With that over with, pick up the sandwich from the floor of the chamber. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked.
