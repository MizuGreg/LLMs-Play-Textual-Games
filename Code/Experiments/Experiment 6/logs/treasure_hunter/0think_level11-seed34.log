I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! First stop, go south. With that over with, pick-up the key from the floor of the salon. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Cookery =-
Of every cookery you could have walked into, you had to walk into a typical one. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You see a chair. The chair is typical. The chair appears to be empty.

There is an open passageway leading east. There is an open door leading south.
