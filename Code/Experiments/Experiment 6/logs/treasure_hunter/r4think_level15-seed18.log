You are now playing a profound round of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First of all, you could, like, open the passageway. After that, make an attempt to take a trip north. Then, open the walnut gate. Then, go west. Then, take a trip south. Following that, retrieve the latchkey from the floor of the closet. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Sauna =-
You arrive in a sauna. A typical kind of place.



There is a closed passageway leading north. There is an open gateway leading south.

-= Bathroom =-
You've come into a typical room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be typical. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the bathroom.

You make out a cabinet. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a drawer. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a trunk.

There is an open passageway leading south. There is a closed walnut gate leading west.

-= Office =-
You've just sauntered into an office.



There is an open walnut gate leading east. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what to do next. The user is in the Office room, which is part of the game. The previous steps were: go north from the Sauna to the Bathroom, open the walnut gate, go west to the Office. Now, the Office has an open walnut gate leading east and a south entranceway that's unguarded.

The original goal was to retrieve the latchkey from the closet's floor and then win. So far, the user has opened the passageway, gone north, opened the walnut gate, and went west. Now in the Office, they need to proceed towards the closet. The next steps might involve going south from the Office, as the south entrance is unguarded. But wait, the user has to retrieve the latchkey from the closet's floor. So maybe the closet is in the Office or another room. Alternatively, maybe the Office has a closet that's accessible.

Looking at the description of the Office: "You've just sauntered into an office. There is an open walnut gate leading east. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded." So the Office has a south passage. The user should go south from the Office. Then, perhaps they'll reach another room, maybe the Closet where the latchkey is. So the next action should be to go south. That makes sense because the user needs to reach the closet to get the latchkey. So the correct command is "go south".
</think>go south

-= Closet =-
You find yourself in a closet. An ordinary one. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You see a stand. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north.

There is a latchkey on the floor.
