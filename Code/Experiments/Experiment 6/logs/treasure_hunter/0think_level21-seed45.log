Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First step, attempt to travel west. After that, head north. Then, retrieve the grape from the rack. That's it!

-= Restroom =-
You've just sauntered into a restroom.



There is an open gate leading south. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

>                                                                                                                                -= Restroom =-0/1
AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go west

-= Cellar =-
Well, here we are in a cellar. Let's see what's in here.

You see an opened toolbox. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You can make out a closed crate in the corner. You scan the room for a stand, and you find a stand. The stand is standard. The stand appears to be empty.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

go north

-= Washroom =-
You've entered a washroom.

You can see a rack. The rack is standard. On the rack you can see a grape. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter! But the thing is empty. This always happens!

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.
