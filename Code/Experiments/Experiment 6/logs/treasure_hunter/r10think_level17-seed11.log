Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an exciting round of TextWorld? You do! Here is how to play! First of all, you could, like, make an attempt to move south. That done, lift the teaspoon from the floor of the cookhouse. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Sauna =-
You find yourself in a sauna.



There is a closed portal leading west. There is an open door leading east. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

go south
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Cookhouse =-
You arrive in a standard kind of place. That is to say, you're in a cookhouse.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a teaspoon on the floor.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is playing a text-based game where they need to lift a teaspoon to win. They've been told to go south first, then lift the teaspoon. But when they tried "lift the teaspoon", the system said it's not a recognized verb.

Hmm, maybe the correct command is just "lift teaspoon" without the article. Let me check the previous interactions. The user tried "lift the teaspoon" multiple times, and each time it was rejected. The game's response was "That's not a verb I recognise." So perhaps the game expects "lift teaspoon" without "the".

But wait, in the initial instruction, the user was told to "lift the teaspoon from the floor of the cookhouse." So maybe the correct command is indeed "lift the teaspoon". But the game is rejecting it. Maybe the game's parser is strict about the wording. Alternatively, maybe the correct verb is "take" instead of "lift". Let me think. In many text adventures, "take" is the verb used for picking up items. So maybe the correct command is "take teaspoon".

But the user was told to "lift the teaspoon", so maybe the game expects "lift". However, the system is not accepting it. Maybe there's a typo or a specific phrasing required. Alternatively, maybe the game is case-sensitive. Let me check the previous commands. The user used "lift the teaspoon" with lowercase letters. The game's response was in lowercase as well. Maybe the correct command is "lift teaspoon" without the article. Let me try that. If that doesn't work, maybe "take teaspoon" is the right verb. But the user was instructed to lift it, so maybe the game expects "lift". Alternatively, maybe the game is using a different verb, like "get".

But the user has tried "lift the teaspoon" multiple times, and it's not working. The game's message is "That's not a verb I recognise." So perhaps the correct command is "take teaspoon". Let me try that. If that doesn't work, maybe the game is expecting "get the teaspoon". But the user was told to "lift the teaspoon", so maybe the game is using "lift" as the correct verb. However, the system is not accepting it. Maybe there's a mistake in the game's code, but the user has to follow the instructions. Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "lift" without the object. But that doesn't make sense. Wait, the user is in the cookhouse, and there's a teaspoon on the floor. So the correct action is to pick it up. If "lift" isn't working, maybe "take" is the right verb. Let me try "take teaspoon".
