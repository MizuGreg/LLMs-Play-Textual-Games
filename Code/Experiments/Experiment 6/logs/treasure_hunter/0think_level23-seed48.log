It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First thing I need you to do is to attempt to go south. After that, venture west. After that, try to take a trip west. Following that, attempt to venture north. After that, make an attempt to move west. And then, try to travel south. With that accomplished, lift the latchkey from the floor of the kitchenette. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Launderette =-
You are in a launderette. A typical one. Let's see what's in here.

You make out a drawer. The drawer is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You see a shelf. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

There is an open hatch leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.
