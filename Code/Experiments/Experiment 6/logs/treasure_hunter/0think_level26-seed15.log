-= Cookhouse =-
You are in a cookhouse. An usual kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

You can see a pan. The pan is normal. But there isn't a thing on it.

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Kitchen =-
Well, here we are in the kitchen. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a rack. The rack is typical. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You can make out a platter. The platter is normal. But the thing is empty. Hm. Oh well

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the south.
