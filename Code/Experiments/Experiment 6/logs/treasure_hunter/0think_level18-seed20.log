You arrive in a salon. A normal one. You begin looking for stuff.

You can see a trunk. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a bench. You shudder, but continue examining the bench. The bench is standard. The bench appears to be empty.

There is an open door leading east. There is an open hatch leading west.

There is a fondue on the floor.

You are in a garage. An ordinary one. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

Hey, want to see a cabinet? Look over there, a cabinet. You can see a locked chest.

There is an open hatch leading east. There is an unblocked exit to the west.
