Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an life changing round of TextWorld? You do! Here is your task for today. First of all, attempt to travel north. And then, lift the key from the floor of the dish-pit. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Bedroom =-
Well how about that, you are in the place we're calling the bedroom.



There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

-= Dish-Pit =-
Wow! You're in a dish-pit.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unblocked exit to the south. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

There is a key on the floor.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this TextWorld game. The goal is to travel north from the bedroom, then lift the key from the dish-pit, and then win. So far, they've gone north from the bedroom into the dish-pit. The current location is the dish-pit, where there's a key on the floor.

The user is asking if they're making the right actions and if they're close to the goal. The next step would be to pick up the key. The prompt says to only output the action, so the correct command here is "lift key". That's the next logical step after finding the key in the dish-pit. They need to lift it to proceed further. The answer should be straightforward, just the command word.
</think>lift key

That's not a verb I recognise.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to play this TextWorld game. The goal is to travel north from the bedroom, then lift the key from the dish-pit, and then win. 

First, they went north from the bedroom, which was correct. Then they tried to "lift key" in the dish-pit. But the game said that's not a recognized verb. Hmm. So maybe the correct command is different. Let me think about how TextWorld works. Usually, you have to use verbs like 'take', 'get', or 'pick up' for picking up items. The key is on the floor, so maybe the right command is 'take key' or 'get key'.

Wait, the user tried 'lift key', which the game didn't recognize. So the correct action should be using 'take' or 'get'. Let me check the game's possible commands. The key is on the floor, so the player needs to pick it up. The correct command would be 'take key' or 'get key'. Since the game didn't accept 'lift', maybe 'take' is the right verb here. 

So the next action should be 'take key' to pick up the key from the floor. Then, after that, the player would have the key and could proceed to the next step, which is probably going north again or through the exit. But according to the original instructions, after lifting the key, the player wins. So once the key is taken, the game should be won. 

But the user is at the dish-pit, so after taking the key, maybe they need to go north again. But the original task said once the key is lifted, they win. So maybe after taking the key, the game ends. But the user hasn't completed the task yet. Wait, the original instructions said: "attempt to travel north. And then, lift the key from the floor of the dish-pit. And once you've done that, you win!" So the order is first go north (which they did), then lift the key (which they tried but failed), then win. So the correct action now is to take the key, which would then win the game. 

So the next command should be 'take key' to pick it up. That's the correct verb here. The game might not recognize 'lift', so 'take' is the right choice. Then, after that, the player wins. So the answer should be 'take key'.
