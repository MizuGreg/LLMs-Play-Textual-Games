Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and complete certain tasks. The goal mentioned initially was to "play through a life-changing round of TextWorld," which might involve reaching a specific location or solving a puzzle.

Looking at the history, the player started in the sauna, then moved to the cookhouse, lifted a teaspoon, and then kept moving between the cookery, kitchen, and back to cookery. The main challenge seems to be navigating the rooms and possibly interacting with objects. The user has been repeatedly going south and north between the cookery and kitchen. 

In the kitchen, there's a closed fridge and a stick of butter on the floor. The user hasn't opened the fridge yet. Since the goal wasn't explicitly stated beyond the initial instructions, maybe the key is to find a way to open the fridge or use the butter in some way. However, the user hasn't tried interacting with the fridge or the butter yet. 

The user's current position is in the kitchen, and the next step might be to open the fridge. But the game's responses don't mention any verbs like "open" or "use," so maybe the correct action is to go east through the portal. Alternatively, since the user has been stuck in a loop between cookery and kitchen, perhaps the correct path is to go east from the kitchen. 

Wait, in the kitchen, there's an open portal leading east. The user might need to go east to proceed. The previous actions were going south and north, but maybe the correct path is to go east from the kitchen. The user hasn't tried that yet. So the next action should be to go east.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and complete certain tasks. The goal mentioned initially was to "play through a life-changing round of TextWorld," which might involve reaching a specific location or solving a puzzle.

Looking at the history, the player started in the sauna, then moved to the cookhouse, lifted a teaspoon, and then kept moving between the cookery, kitchen, and back to cookery. The main challenge seems to be navigating the rooms and possibly interacting with objects. The user has been repeatedly going south and north between the cookery and kitchen. 

In the kitchen, there's a closed fridge and a stick of butter on the floor. The user hasn't opened the fridge yet. Since the goal wasn't explicitly stated beyond the initial instructions, maybe the key is to find a way to open the fridge or use the butter in some way. However, the game's responses don't mention any verbs like "open" or "use," so maybe the correct action is to go east. 

Wait, in the kitchen, there's an open portal leading east. The user might need to go east to proceed. The user hasn't tried that yet. So the next action should be to go east.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and complete certain tasks. The goal mentioned initially was to "play through a life-changing round of TextWorld," which might involve reaching a specific location or solving a puzzle.

Looking at the history, the player started in the sauna, then moved to the cookhouse, lifted a teaspoon, and then kept moving between the cookery, kitchen, and back to cookery. The main challenge seems to be navigating the rooms and possibly interacting with objects. The user has been repeatedly going south and north between the cookery and kitchen. 

In the kitchen, there's a closed fridge and a stick of butter on the floor. The user hasn't opened the fridge yet. Since the goal wasn't explicitly stated beyond the initial instructions, maybe the key is to find a way to open the fridge or use the butter in some way. However, the game's responses don't mention any verbs like "open" or "use," so maybe the correct action is to go east. 

Wait, in the kitchen, there's an open portal leading east. The user might need to go east to proceed. The user hasn't tried that yet. So the next action should be to go east.
