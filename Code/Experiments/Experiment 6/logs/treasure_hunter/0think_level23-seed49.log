You are now playing a exciting round of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. Your first objective is to take a trip east. And then, pick-up the sponge from the floor of the sauna. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Shower =-
You arrive in a shower. An ordinary kind of place. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You can see a basket. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a bench. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the bench! oh well. You make out a counter. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. There is an unguarded exit to the north.

go east

-= Sauna =-
You are in a sauna. A typical one. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."

Look over there! a rack. But the thing is empty.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the north. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

There is a sponge on the floor.
