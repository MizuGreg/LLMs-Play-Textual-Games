I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! First of all, take a trip north. Then, travel east. With that done, take the butterfly from the box. Alright, thanks!

-= Office =-
You find yourself in an usual kind of place. That is to say, you're in an office.

You can see a desk. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

There is an open passageway leading east. There is an open gateway leading north.

-= Chamber =-
You find yourself in a chamber. An ordinary one.



There is an open gateway leading south. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Workshop =-
You've just shown up in a workshop.

You can see a box. The box contains a butterfly. You make out a locker. You can see a portmanteau.

You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.



>                                                                                                                                -= Workshop =-0/3
Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me think through this. The user has been moving through different rooms: first the Office, then the Chamber, and now the Workshop. The goal mentioned was to take a butterfly from a box. In the Workshop, there's a box with a butterfly, so that's the next step. The user was told to take the butterfly from the box after moving north and east. Since they're already in the Workshop, the next logical action is to take the butterfly. The instructions said to only output the action, so the answer should be "take butterfly from box".
</think>take butterfly from box
