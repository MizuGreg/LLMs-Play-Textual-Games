Welcome to another profound episode of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First step, go west. Then, try to take a trip south. Then, venture west. And then, make an effort to venture south. After that, make an effort to go to the east. Then, pick up the sandwich from the floor of the shower. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Studio =-
You find yourself in a studio. A typical one.

You can see a closed box right there by you.

There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the south. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

-= Lounge =-
Fancy seeing you here. Here, by the way, being the lounge. Let's see what's in here.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a bar. The bar is ordinary. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a couch. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The couch is typical. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You think about smashing the couch to bits, throwing the bits in the dump, etc, until you get bored. Look over there! a desk! Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is an unguarded exit to the east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

Ah, the workshop. This is some kind of workshop, really great standard vibes in this place, a wonderful standard atmosphere. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

There is an unguarded exit to the east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a bar. The bar is ordinary. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a couch. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The couch is typical. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You think about smashing the couch to bits, throwing the bits in the dump, etc, until you get bored. Look over there! a desk! Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

-= Lounge =-
Fancy seeing you here. Here, by the way, being the lounge. Let's see what's in here.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a bar. The bar is ordinary. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a couch. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The couch is typical. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You think about smashing the couch to bits, throwing the bits in the dump, etc, until you get bored. Look over there! a desk!
