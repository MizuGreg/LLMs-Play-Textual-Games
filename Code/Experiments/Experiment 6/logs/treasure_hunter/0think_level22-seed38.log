I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! First off, try to go to the north. That done, try to venture west. And then, move north. After that, go north. Once you succeed at that, pick-up the key from the floor of the kitchen. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Sauna =-
You find yourself in a sauna. An usual kind of place. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

You can see a box. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now.

There is an unguarded exit to the north. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

You're now in the workshop.

There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an unblocked exit to the south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.
