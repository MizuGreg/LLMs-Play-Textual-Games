It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, you could, like, open the gateway. And then, attempt to travel east. With that accomplished, make it so that the gate inside the canteen is wide open. Then, make an attempt to go north. Next, try to venture west. After that, travel north. Following that, pick up the grape from the rack inside the washroom. And once you've done that, you win!

I am sorry to announce that you are now in the vault.

You can see a coffer. Classic TextWorld. The coffer is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever!

There is a closed gateway leading east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.
