Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, attempt to go to the south. Next, go to the south. Then, pick up the mop from the floor of the laundry place. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Cookery =-
You are in a cookery. An ordinary kind of place.



There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

You arrive in a studio. A normal one.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.
