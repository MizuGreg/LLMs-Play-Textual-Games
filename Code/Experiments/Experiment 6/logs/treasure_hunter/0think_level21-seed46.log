Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. Your first objective is to go north. Okay, and then, move west. Then, pick up the key from the floor of the cubicle. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Study =-
You're now in the study.

You make out a locked case, which looks standard, close by.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

-= Bathroom =-
You've entered a bathroom.

What's that over there? It looks like it's a drawer.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

-= Cubicle =-
You are in a cubicle. A normal kind of place.

You can see a bureau. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a mantelpiece. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

There is a key on the floor.
