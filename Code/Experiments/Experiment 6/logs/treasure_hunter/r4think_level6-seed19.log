Welcome to another life changing game of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First, it would be a great idea if you could move west. If you can manage that, make an attempt to go south. Then, pick-up the passkey from the floor of the cubicle. Got that? Good!

-= Garage =-
You have stumbled into the most usual of all possible garages. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.



There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

-= Basement =-
You find yourself in a basement. An ordinary kind of place. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

-= Cubicle =-
I am sorry to announce that you are now in the cubicle.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north.

There is a passkey and a key on the floor.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me figure out what to do next. The user is in the Cubicle room. The goal is to pick up the passkey and maybe reach the original goal, which I assume is escaping or completing the game.

In the Cubicle, there's a passkey and a key on the floor. The user needs to pick up the passkey. The exits are to the east and north. The prompt says to pick up the passkey from the floor. So the next step should be to pick up the passkey.

Wait, but the user's previous actions were going west then south, leading to the Cubicle. Now, in the Cubicle, the passkey is on the floor. So the correct action is to pick up the passkey. But the game might require specific commands. The user has to pick up the passkey, so the command should be "take passkey" or "get passkey". But in TextWorld, sometimes the command is just "take" followed by the item. Let me check the previous interactions. The user was told to "pick-up the passkey from the floor of the cubicle." So the correct command is "take passkey" or "get passkey". But in the game's context, maybe it's "pick up passkey". However, the user's previous actions were "go west" and "go south", so following that pattern, the next action should be "pick up passkey". But the system message says to only output the action, like "go north". So the correct command here is "take passkey" or "get passkey". But in the game's context, maybe it's "pick up passkey". However, looking at the previous examples, when the user was told to pick up the passkey, the correct command is "take passkey". So I think the answer is "take passkey".
