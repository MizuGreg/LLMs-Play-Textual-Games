You are now playing a fast paced episode of TextWorld! Your first objective is to move north. And then, venture north. Then, pick-up the loaf of bread from the floor of the cellar. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Lounge =-
You find yourself in a lounge. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a desk. The desk is ordinary. But the thing is empty. You swear loudly.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

-= Restroom =-
You are in a restroom. An ordinary one. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You make out a dresser. The dresser is empty! What a waste of a day! You make out a closed safe.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unblocked exit to the north. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

-= Scullery =-
You are in a scullery. A typical kind of place. You can barely contain your excitement.

Were you looking for a fridge? Because look over there, it's a fridge. A fridge... Is that really what you were looking for?
