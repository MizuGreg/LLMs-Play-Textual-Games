Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an fast paced round of TextWorld? You do! Here is your task for today. Your first objective is to make an effort to move east. Okay, and then, go to the east. Then, recover the shoe from the floor of the attic. Alright, thanks!

-= Study =-
Well, here we are in a study.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Cubicle =-
You are in a cubicle. An ordinary one. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and complete tasks. The current location is a cubicle. The previous action was going east from the study, which led to the cubicle. Now, the user is in the cubicle and needs to decide the next move.

The user's goal is to recover a shoe from the attic's floor. So far, they've moved east from the study to the cubicle. The cubicle has exits to the north, east, and west. The prompt mentions that there's an unguarded exit to the north and unblocked exits to the west and east. The user needs to figure out the best path towards the attic.

The original task was to move east first, then go to the east (maybe a typo, but perhaps moving east again?), then recover the shoe. Since the user is in the cubicle, moving north might be a good idea if that's the direction towards the attic. Alternatively, moving west could lead back to the study, which might not be helpful. The user should check which direction is closer to the attic. Since the study was the starting point, and the cubicle is east of the study, moving north from the cubicle might take them towards the attic. Alternatively, maybe the attic is in the east direction. But the user needs to follow the path that's unblocked. The prompt says there's an exit to the north, which is unguarded, so that's a safe move. The user should go north to proceed further towards the attic. So the next action would be to go north.
</think>go north

-= Recreation Zone =-
You're now in a recreation zone. You start to take note of what's in the room.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in a text-based game. Their goal is to recover a shoe from the attic. So far, they've moved from the study to the cubicle, then to the recreation zone. The current room is the recreation zone, and the prompt suggests going south as the unguarded exit.

Hmm, the user's previous actions were going east, then north. Now, in the recreation zone, the next logical step would be to go south to find the exit back to the study or another area. But wait, the original goal was to get to the attic's floor to recover the shoe. So maybe the path isn't directly leading to the attic yet. However, the game's environment might have the attic connected through these rooms. 

The user's task is to move east, then go to the east (maybe a typo, but perhaps they meant to go east again?), then recover the shoe. But in the current setup, the recreation zone's exit is south. So maybe the path is leading them back towards the study or another area. But since the user is trying to reach the attic, perhaps the recreation zone is part of the path. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go east from the cubicle, but the prompt says the exit to the east is unguarded. Wait, in the cubicle, the prompt said "You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the west." So from the cubicle, east is an option. But the user went north instead. 

Now, in the recreation zone, the exit is south. So going south would take them back to the cubicle. But the user's original goal was to go east from the study, then to the east (maybe a different direction?), then to the attic. Maybe the path isn't straightforward. 

But according to the current room, the recreation zone's exit is south. So the next step would be to go south to return to the cubicle. But the user's original plan was to go east from the study, then east again. Maybe the user is getting confused with directions. Alternatively, maybe the recreation zone is part of the path to the attic. 

But the user's task is to recover the shoe from the attic's floor. So perhaps the correct path is to go east from the study, then east again, then north, etc., to reach the attic. However, the current room is the recreation zone, and the exit is south. So the user might need to go back to the cubicle, then try another direction. 

But the user's next action is to go south from the recreation zone. That would take them back to the cubicle. Then, from the cubicle, maybe they can go east again. But the user's previous action was going north from the cubicle. Wait, in the cubicle, the exit to the north is unguarded. So maybe the user should go north again? But that would take them back to the study. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go east from the cubicle. But the user went north instead. So perhaps the user is not following the correct path. However, the game's environment might have multiple paths, and the user needs to find the right one. 

But the user's original goal was to move east, then go to the east, then recover the shoe. So maybe the correct path is to go east from the study, then east again, then north to reach the attic. However, the current room is the recreation zone, and the exit is south. So perhaps the user needs to go south to the cubicle, then east to the study, then east again. 

But the user's next action is to go south. So the next step would be to go south from the recreation zone. That would take them back to the cubicle. Then, from the cubicle, maybe go east again. But the user's previous action was going north from the cubicle. 

This is a bit confusing. But according to the current prompt, the user is in the recreation zone, and the exit is south. So the next action should be to go south. The user's next move is to go south, which would take them back to the cubicle. Then, from the cubicle, perhaps they can go east again. But the user's original plan was to go east from the study, then east again. 

But the user is now in the recreation zone, so maybe the correct path is to go south, then east, then north to reach the attic. But I need to follow the game's instructions. The user's next action is to go south. So the answer is "go south".

Okay, let's see. The user is navigating through different rooms in a text-based game. Their goal is to recover a shoe from the attic. So far, they've moved from the study, through a cubicle, recreation zone, and back to the cubicle. The current room is the cubicle again, with options to go east, north, or west.

The user's previous actions were going east, then north, then south, which brought them back to the cubicle. Now, they need to decide the next move. The prompt says to think about whether they're on the right track and then act. 

The original goal was to move east, then go to the east, and recover the shoe from the attic. So far, they've been moving between rooms but haven't reached the attic yet. The cubicle has exits to east, north, and west. The recreation zone was a step in the journey, but they're back in the cubicle. 

Since the user is in the cubicle again, the next logical step might be to go east again, as that was the initial direction. Alternatively, maybe north or west. But the original task was to go east first. The user might need to find a path that leads towards the attic. 

Looking at the room descriptions, the cubicle has an exit to the north and west. The recreation zone had a south exit. Maybe the path is a loop, and they need to find the correct direction. Since the user is in the cubicle again, perhaps going east is the right move to proceed further. 

The user's next action should be to go east again, continuing their journey towards the attic. The answer should be "go east".

-= Attic =-
Well, here we are in the attic.



There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

There is a latchkey and a shoe on the floor.

Okay, let's see. The user's goal is to recover the shoe from the attic. So far, they've navigated through the study, cubicle, recreation zone, and back to the cubicle, then to the attic. The current location is the attic, where there's a latchkey and a shoe on the floor.

The next step would be to pick up the shoe. But the game's response mentions the shoe is on the floor, so the player needs to pick it up. However, the available commands might be limited. The user has been moving around, so maybe the correct action here is to take the shoe. But I need to check if there's any other step required. The original task was to move east, then go to the east (maybe a typo, but the path has been followed), then recover the shoe. Since the shoe is in the attic, the next action should be to pick it up. The command would be "take shoe" or "get shoe". But the game might use "take" as the verb. Let me confirm the previous actions. The user has been using "go" commands. So maybe the correct action here is to take the shoe. The answer should be "take shoe".
</think>take shoe
