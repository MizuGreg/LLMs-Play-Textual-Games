I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, you could, like, make an effort to move east. Then, go to the south. After that, open the hatch. Then, go south. Then, attempt to go to the west. And then, ensure that the gateway is open. And then, make an attempt to go west. With that over with, retrieve the latchkey from the floor of the bedroom. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Scullery =-
Ah, the scullery. This is some kind of scullery, really great typical vibes in this place, a wonderful typical atmosphere. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

You can see a pan. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open passageway leading east. There is an open door leading west. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.
