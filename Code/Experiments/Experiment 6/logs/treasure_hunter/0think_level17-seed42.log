-= Laundry Place =-
Of every laundry place you could have walked into, you had to come round an ordinary one.

Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a bench. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

There is an open door leading north. There is an open portal leading west.

You're now in a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

-= Steam Room =-
You've entered a steam room. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You can see a locked drawer. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a shelf. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You see a counter. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. This always happens, here in TextWorld!

There is an open gate leading east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.
