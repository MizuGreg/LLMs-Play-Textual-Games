Welcome to another fast paced episode of TextWorld! First of all, you could, like, ensure that the gate in the basement is open. After that, move west. Then, head north. After that, open the portal. After that, make an effort to go west. With that done, take a trip north. Okay, and then, go to the east. With that done, pick up the passkey from the floor of the office. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Office =-
You've just sauntered into an office.

You can make out a coffer. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a chair. There's something about an object in a room that's just so... TextWorld. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a chair in a room.

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

There is a passkey and a latchkey on the floor.
