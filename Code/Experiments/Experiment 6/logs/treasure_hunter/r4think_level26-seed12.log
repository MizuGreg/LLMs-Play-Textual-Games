Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, try to travel west. And then, make an attempt to move south. After that, travel west. And then, try to move west. Then, make an effort to venture south. Then, make an attempt to go to the east. And then, move east. And then, go to the east. With that over with, try to venture south. If you can do that, try to travel south. Then, attempt to venture west. And then, recover the desktop computer from the floor of the austere workshop. And once you've done that, you win!

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game and has been moving around different rooms. The goal is to recover the desktop computer from the workshop and win. So far, they've gone west from the office into a cubicle, then south into a shower, then west again back to a cubicle. Now they're in a cubicle again, and the description mentions exits to north, south, and west.

The user is asking if they're on the right track and close to the goal. Let me think about the path. The original instructions said to go west, then south, then west, then south, east, east, east, then south again to get to the workshop. But the current location is a cubicle with exits north, south, west. Maybe they need to go north or south from here. But the user's previous moves were west, south, west, so maybe they need to find a way to get to the workshop. The workshop is described as an austere workshop with the desktop computer on the floor. So perhaps the path involves moving through different areas, maybe avoiding certain rooms. The user is in a cubicle again, so maybe they need to go north or south. The next step could be to go north to check if that leads to the workshop. Alternatively, maybe going south from here would take them further. But the user needs to find the right path to reach the workshop. Since the original plan was to go west, south, west, south, east, east, east, south, maybe from the current cubicle, going north would be the next step. But I need to check the possible exits. The cubicle has north, south, west. So the user could try going north, south, or west. The user's previous action was going west, so maybe the next step is to go south again. But the user is asking if they're close. Since the workshop is the final goal, perhaps they need to find the correct path. Maybe the cubicle they're in now is part of the path to the workshop. The user needs to proceed towards the workshop, so maybe going south from here would be the next step. Alternatively, going north might lead to another area. But without more information, the next logical step would be to go south, as per the original plan. However, the user is in a cubicle with an open hatch north and south. The original plan had them go south after some steps, so maybe continuing south is the way. But the user is asking if they're close, so maybe they need to proceed towards the workshop. The answer would be to go south again.

-= Silent Cubicle =-
You find yourself in a cubicle. A silent kind of place.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

You're now in a playroom. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."

You can see a closed locker. You can see a portmanteau. The portmanteau is empty, what a horrible day!

You've just shown up in a salon.

What's that over there? It looks like it's a bookshelf. The bookshelf is typical. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the bookshelf.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

-= Studio =-
You've entered a studio.

You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. The table is typical. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You think about smashing the table to bits, throwing the bits into the garbage, etc, until you get bored. You can make out an armchair. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. This always happens!

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in a bedroom with a chest that's empty. The exits are south and west. The goal is to get the desktop computer from the workshop. So far, they've been moving through different rooms: office, cubicle, shower, cubicle again, silent cubicle, playroom, salon, studio, now bedroom. The path seems to be moving through various office spaces, maybe part of a larger building. The original plan was to go west, south, west, south, east, east, east, south, then get the computer. But the current location is a bedroom. Maybe the workshop is further south or west. The user is asking if they're close. Since they've been moving through different areas, maybe they need to continue exploring. The next step could be to go south or west. The user's previous action was going east to get here. The bedroom has exits to south and west. The original goal was to reach the workshop, so perhaps going south from the bedroom would be the next step. Alternatively, west. But the user needs to follow the original path. The original plan after the studio was to go east, east, east, then south. But they're in the bedroom now. Maybe the workshop is south. So the next action would be to go south.

Okay, the user is in a salon again, having cycled through several rooms: office, cubicle, shower, playroom, studio, bedroom, and back to the cubicle and salon. The goal is to recover the desktop computer from the workshop. So far, the path has been moving through different areas, but the workshop hasn't been reached yet. The user is asking if they're close to the goal.

Looking at the current location, the salon has exits to east, north, and south. The previous steps have been moving west and south, but maybe the correct path requires going east from here. The original plan was to go east multiple times. Alternatively, maybe the workshop is in a different direction. Since the user has been going back and forth between cubicles and salons, perhaps they need to find a different route. The next step could be to go east to proceed further. The user might be stuck in a loop, so trying a new direction could help. The answer should be to go east.

Okay, the user is in a Silent Cubicle again, having looped through several rooms multiple times. The goal is to reach the workshop and get the desktop computer. The path seems to be stuck in a cycle between cubicles, showers, and salons. The user is asking if they're close to the goal.

Looking at the current location, the exits are east, north, south, and west. The previous steps have been moving west and south, but maybe the correct path requires going east or north. The original plan was to go east multiple times. Since the user has been going back and forth, perhaps they need to find a different route. The next step could be to go east to proceed further. The user might be stuck in a loop, so trying a new direction could help. The answer should be to go east.

<think>
Okay, the user is in a Silent Cubicle again, having cycled through multiple rooms multiple times. The goal is to reach the workshop and get the desktop computer. The path seems to be stuck in a loop between cubicles, showers, salons, and the cookhouse. The user is asking if they're close to the goal.

Looking at the current location, the exits are east, north, south, and west. The previous steps have been moving west and south, but maybe the correct path requires going east or north. The original plan was to go east multiple times. Since the user has been going back and forth, perhaps they need to find a different route. The next step could be to go east to proceed further. The user might be stuck in a loop, so trying a new direction could help. The answer should be to go east.

-= Cookhouse =-
Well, here we are in the cookhouse.

What's that over there? It looks like it's a board. The board is normal. The board appears to be empty. You think about smashing the board to bits, throwing the bits into a pit, etc, until you get bored.

There is an open passageway leading east. There is an open portal leading north. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Since the user has been going back and forth, perhaps they need to find a different route. The next step could be to go west as suggested, but the user is asking if they're close.
