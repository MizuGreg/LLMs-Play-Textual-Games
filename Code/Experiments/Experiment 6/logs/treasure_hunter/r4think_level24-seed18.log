Welcome to another exciting session of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First, it would be great if you could head west. And then, retrieve the fresh laundry scented key from the floor of the shower. Then, make it so that the fresh laundry scented door within the shower is unlocked. Then, ensure that the fresh laundry scented door is open. After you have opened the fresh laundry scented door, attempt to travel north. And then, make an effort to take a trip east. And then, make it so that the portal in the studio is opened. Then, make an effort to go to the north. And then, retrieve the latchkey from the floor of the cubicle. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Serious Studio =-
You're not going to believe this, but you've just entered a serious studio.

You see a stand. But there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is an open oak door leading south. There is an open wooden door leading west.

You arrive in a shower. A normal kind of place. You begin looking for stuff.

As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a table. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is a closed fresh laundry scented door leading north. There is an open wooden door leading east.

There is a fresh laundry scented key on the floor.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in the Shower scene. They have the fresh laundry scented key. The next step according to the initial instructions was to unlock the fresh laundry scented door leading north. Since they have the key, they need to use it on the door.

The door is currently closed. So the correct action here would be to use the key to unlock the door. The command should be "unlock fresh laundry scented door" or something similar. But in the game's context, maybe the exact phrasing is "unlock the door" or "use the key on the door". However, looking at previous actions, the user took the key from the floor, so the next logical step is to use it on the door to unlock it. The door is closed, so unlocking it would open it. Then, after unlocking, they need to open the door, then go north, etc.

So the next action should be to unlock the door with the key. The correct command here would be "unlock fresh laundry scented door" or "use fresh laundry scented key on fresh laundry scented door". But the game might expect a simpler command like "unlock door" if the door's description is specific. However, since the door is described as "fresh laundry scented", it's safer to include that in the command to match the game's expectations. So the next action is to unlock the door using the key.

Okay, let's see. The user has just opened the fresh laundry scented door. The next step in the original plan was to travel north after opening the door. So the next action should be to go north. The command would be "go north". But I need to make sure that the door is indeed open and that moving north is possible. Since the previous steps were successful, it's safe to proceed with "go north".

You've walked into a normal room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be normal. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the workshop. Let's see what's in here.



There is an open fresh laundry scented door leading south. There is an open gateway leading east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in the Workshop scene. The previous actions were going north from the Shower, which led to the Workshop. The goal was to eventually reach the studio's portal and retrieve the latchkey. But currently, in the Workshop, the user needs to find the right path.

The Workshop has an open fresh laundry scented door south, a gateway east, and the user is told to try going north or west. But the user has been looking around, maybe trying to find items or clues. The original plan was to go to the studio, open the portal, then get the latchkey. But maybe the Workshop is part of the path.

Wait, the user's previous action was "look", but the description doesn't mention any items. The user needs to move. The instructions said after opening the door in the shower, go north, then take east, then open the studio's portal. But in the Workshop, the user is told to try going north or west. However, the user might need to find the portal in the studio. But the current location is the Workshop. Maybe the gateway east is the way to the studio? Or perhaps the portal is in the Workshop. But the user hasn't found it yet.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west from the Workshop. The description says "You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west." So maybe the correct next step is to go west. But the user has been looking, so maybe they need to move. The next action should be to go west or east. The original plan was to go east after going north. But in the Workshop, the user is at a crossroads. The gateway east is open, so maybe that's the direction. But the user's goal is to reach the studio's portal. So perhaps the correct next step is to go east through the gateway. But the user needs to check if that's the right path. Alternatively, maybe the portal is in the Workshop, but the description doesn't mention it. So the user should follow the hints given. The user is told to try going north or west. But the user is already in the Workshop, so maybe the next step is to go west. However, the user's previous action was looking, so maybe they need to move. The correct command would be "go east" or "go west". The original plan said after going north, take east. But in the Workshop, the user is at a point where they need to choose between east or west. The user should follow the original plan's instruction to go east. So the next action is "go east".

-= Studio =-
You find yourself in a studio. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You make out a bureau. You can see a chair. The chair is typical. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the chair.

There is a closed portal leading north. There is an open gateway leading west.

Okay, the user is in the Studio and needs to open the portal. The previous action was "open portal in studio", but the game responded that the user only understood up to wanting to open the portal. So maybe the correct command is just "open portal" without specifying "in studio" again. The original goal was to open the portal in the studio, so the next step is to try opening it again with the correct command. Then, after opening, the user needs to retrieve the latchkey from the cubicle. But first, the portal needs to be opened. So the next action is to open the portal.

Okay, the user tried to go north after opening the portal, but the game said "That's not a verb I recognise." So maybe "go north" isn't the correct command here. Perhaps the correct action is to use the portal instead. Since the portal is open, maybe the user needs to pass through it. The previous step was opening the portal, so the next action should be to go through the portal. The command might be "use portal" or "go through portal". But the game might expect "go north" if the portal leads north. Wait, the user is in the Studio, and there's a closed portal leading north. After opening it, the user should be able to go north through it. But the game didn't accept "go north". Maybe the correct command is "go through portal" or "use portal". Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check the portal's state again. But the user already opened it. So the next step is to move through the portal. The correct command is likely "go through portal" or "use portal". Since the user previously used "open portal", maybe "use portal" is the next step. But the game might expect "go north" if the portal is the way to go. However, the user's previous attempt to "go north" was rejected. So perhaps the correct command is "use portal" or "go through portal". Let me check the previous game states. In the Studio, after opening the portal, the user should be able to go north. But the game might require the exact command. Maybe "go north" is correct, but the user made a typo. Wait, the user wrote "go north" and the game said it's not a recognized verb. So maybe the correct command is "go through portal" or "use portal". Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "enter portal". So the next action should be "use portal" or "go through portal".
