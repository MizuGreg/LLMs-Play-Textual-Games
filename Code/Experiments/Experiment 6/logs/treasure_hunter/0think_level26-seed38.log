Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to attempt to travel east. If you can succeed at that, try to go east. Then, make an effort to venture north. After that, take a trip east. Then, travel east. With that done, make an effort to move south. Then, try to travel south. Then, move south. After that, make an attempt to go west. And then, venture north. And then, head north. Next, pick up the key from the floor of the kitchen. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Office =-
You have moved into the most normal of all possible offices. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

You see a bookshelf. The bookshelf is standard. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

You are in a vault. An usual kind of place. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a case. You can see a table. The table is standard. But there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.
