It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! First step, try to travel north. Following that, pick up the formless passkey from the floor of the basement. After stealing the formless passkey, try to venture south. With that accomplished, assure that the formless passageway is unlocked. If you have unlocked the formless passageway, open the formless passageway. And then, move east. With that accomplished, make an effort to venture east. Then, go to the south. And then, make an attempt to move east. And then, make an attempt to go east. That done, attempt to take a trip north. If you can get through with that, pick up the keyboard from the floor of the workshop. And once you've done that, you win!

<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what to do next. The user is in the basement, has picked up the formless passkey. The goal is to unlock the formless passageway, then go through it, and eventually get the keyboard from the workshop.

First, the current location is the basement. The user has the formless passkey. The next step mentioned in the initial instructions was to venture south after stealing the passkey. But wait, the basement has an exit to the south. So maybe they need to go south back to the shower area? But the user already went north from the shower to the basement. Now, after picking up the passkey, the next step according to the plan was to venture south. But the basement's south exit is unguarded. So maybe go south back to the shower? But the shower's description mentioned a board and an exit to the north. But the user is in the basement now. So the next action should be to go south. But the user is at the basement, so going south would take them back to the shower. But the initial plan said after stealing the passkey, venture south. So maybe that's the next step. But the user has to make sure the formless passageway is unlocked. Wait, the formless passageway is closed and leads east. The user has the passkey, so maybe they need to use it to unlock the passageway. But how? The instruction says "assure that the formless passageway is unlocked. If you have unlocked the formless passageway, open the formless passageway." So maybe after getting the passkey, they need to unlock it. But how? Maybe using the passkey on the passageway. But the passageway is closed. So perhaps the user needs to go east to the passageway, use the passkey to unlock it. But the passageway is closed, so maybe the user has to open it. But the user is in the basement. The basement has a closed formless passageway leading east. So maybe the user needs to go east to the passageway, then use the passkey to unlock it. But the user hasn't gone east yet. Wait, the initial plan was: after stealing the passkey, venture south. But the basement's south exit is unguarded. So maybe the user should go south first. But the user's next action is to go south. But the user is in the basement. So the next action would be to go south. But the user is at the basement, so going south would take them back to the shower. But the shower's exit is north. But the user is in the basement, so maybe they need to go south to the shower, then north again? Wait, the initial plan said after stealing the passkey, venture south. So maybe the user should go south from the basement. So the next action is go south. But the user is in the basement, so that's possible. But the user's next step is to go south. Then, after that, they need to make sure the formless passageway is unlocked. But the passageway is closed. So maybe after going south, they need to go back east to the passageway and unlock it. But the user hasn't done that yet. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east first. Wait, the initial plan said after stealing the passkey, venture south. Then, assure the passageway is unlocked. So maybe after going south, they need to go back east to the passageway and unlock it. But the user is in the basement. So the steps would be: go south to the shower, then go east to the passageway, then unlock it. But the user is in the basement now. So the next action is to go south. So the user's next command should be go south.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the shower, trying to open the formless passageway east. But they need to unlock it first with the passkey. They have the formless passkey from the basement. So the previous steps were: go north to basement, pick up passkey, go south back to shower, then try to open the passageway. But the game says they have to unlock it with the passkey. So the next step should be to use the passkey on the passageway. But how? The command might be to unlock the passageway with the passkey. Wait, the user has the passkey, so maybe the action is to unlock the passageway. But the game says "you have to unlock the formless passageway with the formless passkey first." So the user needs to perform the action of unlocking it. The previous attempt was to open it, but that's not the right command. So the correct action is to unlock the passageway using the passkey. So the next command should be "unlock formless passageway" or something similar. But the game might expect a specific command. Looking at the previous interactions, when the user tried to open it, the game said they needed to unlock it first. So maybe the correct command is "unlock formless passageway". But the user has the passkey, so perhaps the game expects them to use the passkey to unlock it. But the command might just be "unlock formless passageway". So the next action is to unlock the passageway.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user has successfully unlocked and opened the formless passageway. Now they need to move east through it. The previous attempt to go east was denied because the passageway wasn't open, but after opening it, they should be able to go through. So the next step is to go east into the passageway. Once they're in there, maybe they'll find the keyboard or reach the workshop. The goal was to get the keyboard from the workshop, so after passing through the passageway, they might need to navigate further. But according to the initial plan, after going east through the passageway, they should move east again, then south, then east, then north to get the keyboard. But currently, the user is in the shower, having opened the passageway. So the next action is to go east into the passageway. Once inside, they might encounter new elements. The command should be "go east" again.

Okay, let's recap the user's progress so far. They started in the shower, went north to the basement, picked up the formless passkey, then returned to the shower, unlocked and opened the formless passageway, and moved east into the study. From there, they tried to go east again but were told that's not a valid command. Instead, they looked around and ended up in the bedroom. Now, they're in the bedroom, which seems to be a dead end with no obvious items to pick up. The original goal was to get the keyboard from the workshop.

The user's current location is the bedroom, which has an open gate north, a door west, and an exit south. The previous attempt to go east from the study led to the bedroom. The user's inventory includes the formless passkey. The next step would be to check the available directions again. Since the user is in the bedroom, they can try going west back to the study or north through the gate. The exit south would take them back to the shower. However, the keyboard is supposed to be in the workshop, which hasn't been visited yet. The user needs to find a way to reach the workshop. Maybe the gate north leads to another area. Alternatively, the door west might lead back to the study, which was where they came from. The user might need to explore the north gate to find the workshop. But since the user is in the bedroom, the next action should be to go north through the open gate. That's the logical next step to proceed towards the workshop.

You make out a crate! Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You can see a stand. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The stand is normal. However, the stand, like an empty stand, has nothing on it. Hopefully, this discovery doesn't ruin your TextWorld experience! You can make out a counter. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the counter.

There is an open portal leading north. There is an open gate leading south. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Vault, which has an empty locker and exits to the east, south, and west. The goal is to get the keyboard from the workshop. So far, the user has been moving through different rooms, but hasn't found the workshop yet. The last action was looking around the Vault. The available exits are east, south, and west. The user needs to find the workshop. Since the Vault has an exit to the east, maybe that's the direction to go. But the user tried going east before and it wasn't a valid command. Wait, in the Attic, the user was told to try going east, but it wasn't a verb. Maybe the correct command is "go east" again. Alternatively, the user might need to check the available directions again. The Vault has an exit to the east, so the next step should be to go east. The user's previous attempt to go east from the Attic was rejected, but maybe from the Vault, it's possible. So the next action should be "go east".

Maybe the system just needs to process it again. Alternatively, check the available directions. The Pantry's west exit is unblocked, so the next action is to go west. The user needs to navigate through the rooms to reach the workshop where the keyboard is. So the next command is "go west".

You've just shown up in a vault.

You make out an opened locker close by. The locker is empty! What a waste of a day!

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

Okay, the user is in the Dish-Pit, which has an opened cabinet (empty) and a plate and platter that are also empty. The exit is south. The previous actions have been moving through various rooms, but the keyboard hasn't been found yet. The goal is to get the keyboard from the workshop. The user needs to find the workshop. The current location is the Dish-Pit, so the next step is to go south as indicated. The command should be "go south".

Okay, the user is in the Bedchamber again. They tried to go north but got an error. The available exits are south and possibly west or east. The previous rooms suggest that the correct direction might be west. Let me check the previous locations. The user came from the Dish-Pit, so going west from the Bedchamber might lead back to the Pantry or another area. The correct command should be "go west" instead of north.

However, the stand, like an empty stand, has nothing on it. Hopefully, this discovery doesn't ruin your TextWorld experience! You can make out a counter. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the counter.

There is an open portal leading north. There is an open gate leading south. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east.

-= Attic =-
You're now in an attic.

You make out a crate! Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You can see a stand. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The stand is normal. However, the stand, like an empty stand, has nothing on it. Hopefully, this discovery doesn't ruin your TextWorld experience! You can make out a counter. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the counter.

There is an open portal leading north. There is an open gate leading south. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east.

You've just shown up in a vault.

You make out an opened locker close by. The locker is empty! What a waste of a day!

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.
