Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Your task for today is to pick up the sandwich from the floor of the chamber.

-= Chamber =-
You're now in the chamber. You start to take note of what's in the room.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

There is a sandwich on the floor.
