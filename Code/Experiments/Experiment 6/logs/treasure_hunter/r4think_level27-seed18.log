Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, you could, like, attempt to travel south. And then, make an effort to take a trip east. And then, make an attempt to move east. Following that, open the oak door in the closet. Then, make an effort to go to the north. And then, make an effort to move west. After that, lift the fresh laundry scented key from the floor of the shower. With the fresh laundry scented key, insert the fresh laundry scented key into the fresh laundry scented door in the shower's lock to unlock it. And then, ensure that the fresh laundry scented door inside the shower is open. After that, travel north. Then, attempt to move east. After that, open the portal. Then, attempt to head north. Then, pick-up the latchkey from the floor of the cubicle. Got that? Good!

-= Laundromat =-
You arrive in a laundromat. An ordinary one. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You can see a rack. The rack is normal. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a counter. You shudder, but continue examining the counter. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is an unblocked exit to the south.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in a text-based game. They started by going south, then north, then east. But every time they tried to go east, it said "You can't go that way." So maybe there's a mistake in the steps they're following.

Looking back at the initial instructions, after going south and then north, they were back in the Laundromat. The next step was to take a trip east. But the Laundromat's description says there's an unblocked exit to the south, but when they tried to go east, it wasn't possible. Wait, maybe the correct path isn't east from the Laundromat. Maybe the east exit is blocked, so they need to find another way.

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to open the oak door in the closet first. The original instructions mentioned opening the oak door in the closet after moving east twice. But if they can't go east, maybe they need to check other areas. However, the current location is the Laundromat, which doesn't mention a closet. Hmm.

Wait, the user's first action was to go south, which took them to the Sauna. Then they went north back to Laundromat. Then tried to go east, but it's blocked. So maybe the next step is to check other directions. The Laundromat has a south exit, but they came from there. Maybe they need to look for other objects or actions. The original plan was to open the oak door in the closet, but if there's no closet here, perhaps they need to explore more.

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go east from the Sauna instead of the Laundromat. Wait, in the Sauna, the description says there's an open door leading east. The user went north from the Sauna, which brought them back to Laundromat. Maybe they should have gone east from the Sauna first. But the initial instructions said to go south, then east, then east again. Maybe the steps are incorrect.

So the user is stuck in the Laundromat, trying to go east but can't. The next possible action might be to check other directions, but the only exit is south. Alternatively, maybe they need to interact with objects here. The Laundromat has a rack and a counter, but nothing on them. Maybe there's a key or item they can pick up. But the original plan was to pick up the fresh laundry scented key from the shower, which is in a different location.

Wait, the user's original plan was: after going north and west, pick up the key from the shower. But they haven't reached the shower yet. So maybe they need to find another path. But the current location is Laundromat, which doesn't have a shower. So perhaps the user is following the wrong sequence of steps.

The correct path might involve going east from the Sauna, but the user went north instead. So maybe the next step is to go east from the Sauna, but the user was in the Laundromat. So the user might have made a mistake in their steps. The initial instructions said to go south, then east, then east again. But in the Sauna, there's an east door. Maybe the user should have gone east from the Sauna first, then proceeded.

But the user's current location is Laundromat, so they need to find another way. Maybe they need to go south again to return to the Sauna and then go east. But the user is confused. The next action should be to go south again to return to the Sauna, then try going east from there. But the user is in the Laundromat, so the correct next step is to go south to return to the Sauna, then east. But the user's last action was trying to go east from Laundromat, which is blocked. So the next step is to go south again to the Sauna, then east.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out what's going on here. The user is in a text-based game where they need to follow a series of steps to reach a goal. The current location is the Laundromat, and they've tried going east multiple times, but it's not possible. The previous steps involved moving south, north, east, but got stuck.

Looking back at the initial instructions, the user was supposed to: go south, then east, then east again, open the oak door in the closet, go north, west, pick up the key from the shower, unlock the door, then go north, east, open the portal, north, pick up the latchkey.

But in the current state, after going back and forth between Laundromat, Sauna, Cookhouse, and back, the user is stuck in Laundromat again. The problem is that the Laundromat doesn't have an east exit, so trying to go east there is impossible. The user might be following the wrong sequence of steps.

Perhaps the correct path is to go east from the Sauna (which has an east door) instead of going north back to Laundromat. But the user tried that earlier and ended up in the Cookhouse. Then going west back to Sauna, north to Laundromat again. So maybe the user needs to find another way to get to the shower or the closet where the key is.

Alternatively, maybe the oak door in the closet is in the Laundromat, but the user hasn't checked the closet. However, the Laundromat's description doesn't mention a closet. The user might need to look for other objects or actions. But the initial steps required opening the oak door in the closet, which isn't present here.

Wait, maybe the user is supposed to go east from the Cookhouse. The Cookhouse has an east gateway and a west door. The user went west back to Sauna. Maybe they should try going east from Cookhouse again. But the user is currently in Laundromat, so they need to get back to Cookhouse.

The correct sequence might be: from Laundromat, go south to Sauna, then east to Cookhouse, then maybe find a way to proceed. But the user is stuck in Laundromat, trying east again. So the next action should be to go south again to return to Sauna, then east to Cookhouse. But the user is in Laundromat, so the next step is to go south to Sauna, then east to Cookhouse. However, the user's last action was going east from Laundromat, which is blocked, so the next command should be to go south again.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Shower, has picked up the fresh laundry scented key, and now needs to unlock the fresh laundry scented door. The previous attempt was to open the door, but they were told to unlock it first. So the correct action now is to use the key to unlock the door. The command should be "unlock fresh laundry scented door with fresh laundry scented key" but since the game might expect a shorter form, maybe just "unlock door" or "use key on door". But looking at the previous interactions, when they took the key, the next step was to open the door, but it required unlocking. So the correct command here is to unlock the door with the key. The exact phrasing might be "unlock fresh laundry scented door" or "use fresh laundry scented key on fresh laundry scented door". But the game's response was "you have to unlock... with the key first", so the next action is to unlock the door using the key. The correct command is "unlock fresh laundry scented door".

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Shower, has unlocked and opened the fresh laundry scented door. The next step according to the original plan was to go north after opening the door. But the user just opened the door, so the next action should be to go north. However, the previous attempt to go north was blocked because the door was closed. Now that the door is open, going north should be possible. So the next command is "go north".

You've walked into a normal room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be normal. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the workshop. Let's see what's in here.



There is an open fresh laundry scented door leading south. There is an open gateway leading east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

Okay, let's see. The user has been navigating through various rooms in the game, following a set of instructions. They started in the Laundromat, moved to the Sauna, Cookhouse, Closet, Serious Studio, Shower, and now they're in the Spare Room again. The goal was to pick up the latchkey from the cubicle, but the user hasn't mentioned that yet.

Looking at the current location, the Spare Room has an unguarded exit to the east and an unblocked exit to the north. The user has been moving back and forth between rooms. The original plan included going north, then west, then picking up the key from the cubicle. But the user is currently in the Spare Room. The next step might be to go east to the Salon again or north to the Workshop. However, the user's previous actions suggest they might be looping between rooms without finding the cubicle.

Wait, the original instructions mentioned picking up the latchkey from the floor of the cubicle. The user hasn't encountered a cubicle yet. Maybe the cubicle is in a different room. The user is in the Spare Room now. The exits are east to Salon and north to Workshop. The Salon was visited earlier, but the Workshop is where the user started. Maybe the cubicle is in the Workshop or another room. Alternatively, the user might need to check all possible exits again. Since the user is in the Spare Room, the next logical step is to go east to the Salon again or north to the Workshop. But the user might need to explore more rooms to find the cubicle. However, the user's last action was going west from the Workshop to the Spare Room. The next step should be to check the other exit, which is east to the Salon. But the user might need to continue moving until they find the cubicle. Alternatively, maybe the cubicle is in the Serious Workshop or another room. The user needs to keep moving until they find it. The next action should be to go east to the Salon again.

There is an open fresh laundry scented door leading south. There is an open gateway leading east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Workshop, Spare Room, and Salon. They've been moving back and forth without finding the cubicle where the latchkey is. The original goal was to pick up the latchkey from the cubicle. So far, the user has only found the fresh laundry scented key in the shower but hasn't located the cubicle yet.

Looking at the current location, the Spare Room has exits to the east (Salon) and north (Workshop). The user needs to find the cubicle, which hasn't been mentioned in any of these rooms. Maybe the cubicle is in the Serious Workshop or another room not yet explored. Alternatively, the user might need to check all possible exits again. Since the user is in the Spare Room, the next step should be to go east to the Salon again or north to the Workshop. But since the user has already tried those, maybe they need to explore other rooms. However, the current path is looping, so the user might need to try a different approach. The next action should be to go east to the Salon again to check if the cubicle is there.

You've entered a salon. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

Hey, want to see a bed stand? Look over there, a bed stand. On the bed stand you make out a fondue. You can see a bench. But the thing is empty. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.
