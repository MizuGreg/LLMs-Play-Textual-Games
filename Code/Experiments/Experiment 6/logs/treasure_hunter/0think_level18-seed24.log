Welcome to TextWorld! First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to take a trip east. That done, pick up the pear from the toolbox. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Washroom =-
You're now in the washroom. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You can make out a closed safe.

There is a closed gate leading south. There is an open portal leading east. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

-= Spare Room =-
You find yourself in a spare room. A standard kind of place.

You can see an opened toolbox in the room. The toolbox contains a pear. Now that's what I call TextWorld!

There is an open passageway leading east. There is an open portal leading west. There is an unguarded exit to the south.
