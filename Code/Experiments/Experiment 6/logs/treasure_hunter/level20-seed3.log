Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to make an effort to go west. Then, take a trip north. After that, head west. Okay, and then, try to head south. After that, pick-up the teaspoon from the floor of the cookhouse. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Cubicle =-
This might come as a shock to you, but you've just stumbled into a cubicle.

You make out a locked case.

You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Vault =-
You are in a vault. An usual kind of place.

You see a safe. You can make out a counter. The counter is ordinary. But there isn't a thing on it.

There is an open gate leading north. There is an unguarded exit to the east.



>                                                                                                                                -= Vault =-0/2
Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they need to follow specific directions to reach a goal. The current location is the Vault. The original instructions were to go west, then north, then west again, then south, and pick up the teaspoon from the cookhouse.

First, the user started by going west from the Cubicle, which led them to the Vault. Now, in the Vault, the next step according to the initial instructions was to go north. The Vault has an open gate leading north and an unguarded exit to the east. Since the next step is to go north, the correct action here would be to move north. The user hasn't done that yet, so the next command should be "go north". 

I need to make sure that each step is followed in order. The user is trying to navigate through the game's environment, and each movement is part of the path to the goal. The key is to stick to the sequence provided: west, north, west, south, then pick up the teaspoon. So after going west to the Vault, the next step is indeed north. The user hasn't done that yet, so the next action should be "go north".
</think>go north
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Workshop =-
You find yourself in a workshop. An ordinary one.

You make out a locker. The locker is empty! What a waste of a day!

There is an open gate leading south. There is an open door leading west.



>                                                                                                                                -= Workshop =-0/3

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text adventure game. The original goal was to go west, then north, then west again, then south, pick up the teaspoon from the cookhouse. So far, the user has gone west from the cubicle to the vault, then north to the workshop. Now, the current location is the workshop. The next step according to the original instructions was to head west again. The workshop has a door leading west that's open. So the next action should be to go west. Let me check the environment again. The workshop has an open gate south and an open door west. So going west makes sense. The user hasn't picked up the teaspoon yet, so maybe after exploring west, they might find it. But according to the steps given, the next action is to go west. So the answer should be "go west".
</think>go west
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Sauna =-
You find yourself in a sauna.



There is a closed portal leading west. There is an open door leading east. There is an unguarded exit to the south.



>                                                                                                                                -= Sauna =-0/4

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game where they need to follow a series of directions to reach the goal. The original instructions were to go west, then north, then west again, then south, pick up the teaspoon in the cookhouse.

So far, the user has gone west from the cubicle into the vault, then north to the workshop, then west to the sauna. Now they're in the sauna. The next step according to the original plan was to go south. But the current location is the sauna. Let me check the environment again.

In the sauna, the exits are: a closed portal west, open door east, and unguarded exit south. The user's next action should be to go south, as per the original plan. But wait, the user is in the sauna, and the south exit is unguarded. So going south from the sauna would take them to the next area. Let me make sure that this is the correct path. The goal is to reach the cookhouse and pick up the teaspoon. So far, the user hasn't encountered the cookhouse yet. The path so far has taken them through vault, workshop, sauna. The next step is south from the sauna. That should lead them to the next area, possibly the cookhouse. So the next command should be "go south".
</think>go south

-= Cookhouse =-
You arrive in a standard kind of place. That is to say, you're in a cookhouse.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a teaspoon on the floor.


>                                                                                                                                -= Cookhouse =-0/5
Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me figure out what to do next. The user's goal is to pick up the teaspoon from the cookhouse. So far, they've gone west, north, west, and south, ending up in the cookhouse. The current location is the cookhouse, and there's a teaspoon on the floor.

The prompt says to pick up the teaspoon. But in TextWorld-style games, you usually need to pick up items by using a command like "take teaspoon" or "pick up teaspoon". However, the user's previous actions have been moving directions, and the assistant is supposed to only output the action command, nothing else.

Wait, the user's last action was "go south", which led them to the cookhouse. Now, in the cookhouse, the teaspoon is on the floor. So the next step is to pick up the teaspoon. The correct command here would be "take teaspoon" or "pick up teaspoon". But I need to check if the game expects a specific syntax. Since the user has been moving around, maybe the correct action is to take the teaspoon.

But the user's instruction says to only output the command. So the answer should be "take teaspoon" or similar. However, looking back at the previous interactions, the user's actions were all directions. But in this case, the teaspoon is an item that needs to be picked up. So the correct action here is to take the teaspoon. Therefore, the next command should be "take teaspoon".
</think>take teaspoon
