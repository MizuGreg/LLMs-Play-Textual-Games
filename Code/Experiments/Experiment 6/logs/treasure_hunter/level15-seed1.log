Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and find a passkey on a bench to win. So far, they've been moving between the Studio, Spare Room, Dish-Pit, and Cookhouse. The current location is the Dish-Pit, and the next step is to go north again.

Looking at the previous steps, the user has been moving in a loop between the Dish-Pit and Spare Room. The instruction was to go west, then south, then east, north, and so on. But the main goal is to find the passkey on the bench. 

In the current room (Dish-Pit), there's a refrigerator mentioned, but no bench. The exit to the east is unguarded, and the user is advised to go north. However, the user has been going back and forth between rooms without finding the bench. The passkey is supposed to be on a bench, but the user hasn't encountered a bench yet.

Wait, in the Studio, there's a stand mentioned, but nothing on it. In the Spare Room, there's a counter but nothing on it. The Cookhouse has an open passageway east, but no bench. The Dish-Pit has a refrigerator. Maybe the bench is in another room that's not been explored yet. 

But according to the current path, the user is stuck in a loop. The user needs to find the bench. Maybe the bench is in the Cookhouse? Or perhaps in the Studio? The user hasn't checked all rooms thoroughly. However, the current instruction is to go north from the Dish-Pit, which leads back to the Spare Room. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east from the Dish-Pit, which is unguarded. Let me check the previous steps. When in the Dish-Pit, the user was told to go north, but the exit to the east is unguarded. Maybe the passkey is in the Cookhouse, which was mentioned earlier. The user needs to go east from the Cookhouse. 

But the user's last action was going north from the Dish-Pit, leading back to the Spare Room. The user might be missing a key step. The original task was to go west, then south, then east, north, then recover the passkey from the bench. 

Wait, maybe the bench is in the Spare Room? But the Spare Room has a counter with nothing on it. The Studio's stand is empty. The Cookhouse hasn't been checked for a bench. The user needs to explore the Cookhouse more thoroughly. 

But the user's current position is the Dish-Pit. The next step is to go north, which leads back to the Spare Room. The user might need to go east from the Dish-Pit, which is unguarded. Let me check the previous steps again. 

In the Dish-Pit, the user was told: "There is an unguarded exit to the east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north." So maybe the user should go east instead of north. But the user has been going north repeatedly. 

Wait, the user's last action was going north from the Dish-Pit, which brings them back to the Spare Room. But the user hasn't checked the east exit yet. Maybe the passkey is in the east direction. However, the user's task was to go east after moving north. 

Alternatively, maybe the bench is in the Cookhouse. The user needs to go east from the Cookhouse. But the user hasn't been there yet. The user's path has been looping between the Dish-Pit and Spare Room. 

So, the user needs to break the loop and go east from the Dish-Pit. The instruction says to go east from the Dish-Pit. But the user's last action was going north. The correct next step would be to go east from the Dish-Pit. However, the user's current position is the Dish-Pit, and the exit to the east is unguarded. 

Therefore, the next action should be to go east from the Dish-Pit. That would lead to the Cookhouse. Then, in the Cookhouse, the user can check for the bench. So the user should go east now.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Dish-Pit and Spare Room. They've been going back and forth between these two areas repeatedly. The original goal was to find the passkey on a bench. So far, the user hasn't found any bench mentioned in the rooms they've explored. The key is likely in a room they haven't checked yet.

Looking at the previous steps, the user went from the Dish-Pit to the Spare Room and back. The Cookhouse was mentioned earlier, but the user didn't explore it thoroughly. The Cookhouse has an open passageway east and an exit to the west. Maybe the bench is in the Cookhouse or another room beyond that.

The user's last action was going north from the Dish-Pit, which leads back to the Spare Room. To break the loop, they need to try a different direction. In the Dish-Pit, there's an unguarded exit to the east. The user should go east instead of north. That would take them to the Cookhouse, where they can check for the bench. The passkey is supposed to be on a bench, so exploring the Cookhouse is the next logical step. The user needs to go east from the Dish-Pit to reach the Cookhouse and then look for the bench there.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Dish-Pit, Spare Room, and Studio. They've been moving back and forth without finding the passkey on the bench. The original goal was to recover the passkey from the bench and win.

So far, the user hasn't found any bench mentioned in the rooms they've explored. The key is likely in a room they haven't checked yet. The Cookhouse was mentioned earlier, but the user didn't explore it thoroughly. The Cookhouse has an open passageway east and an exit to the west. Maybe the bench is in the Cookhouse or another room beyond that.

The user's last action was going west from the Studio, leading back to the Spare Room. To break the loop, they need to try a different direction. In the Dish-Pit, there's an unguarded exit to the east. The user should go east instead of north. That would take them to the Cookhouse, where they can check for the bench. The passkey is supposed to be on a bench, so exploring the Cookhouse is the next logical step. The user needs to go east from the Dish-Pit to reach the Cookhouse and then look for the bench there.
