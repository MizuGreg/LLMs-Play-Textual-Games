Welcome to TextWorld! First, it would be a great idea if you could move west. Next, travel west. If you can get around to doing that, try to venture west. Then, venture west. Then, try to head south. That done, head east. Okay, and then, make an attempt to go to the south. Once you finish that, travel south. If you can get through with that, lift the keycard from the floor of the bar. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

Well, here we are in a washroom. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

You make out a locked dresser. You can see a bench. But there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You scan the room, seeing a table. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a table? But there isn't a thing on it. Sometimes, just sometimes, TextWorld can just be the worst.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.
