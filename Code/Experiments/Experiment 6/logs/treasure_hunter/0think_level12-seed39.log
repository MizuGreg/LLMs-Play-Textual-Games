Welcome to another profound session of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First thing I need you to do is to open the gateway. And then, travel east. And then, recover the burger from the floor of the cubicle. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Kitchenette =-
You're now in a kitchenette. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

You make out an opened cabinet. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this?

There is a closed gateway leading east. There is an open passageway leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

There is a burger on the floor.
