I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is how to play! First of all, make an effort to move west. Okay, and then, retrieve the fondue from the floor of the studio. Alright, thanks!

-= Steam Room =-
You arrive in a steam room. An usual kind of place. You begin looking for stuff.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

There is a cashew on the floor.

-= Studio =-
A rusty sign tells you that you are now in the studio. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

There is a fondue on the floor.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game called TextWorld. Their goal is to retrieve the fondue from the studio and probably reach the original goal, which might be escaping or completing a quest.

So far, the user has moved west from the Steam Room into the Studio, then north into the Dish-Pit, and then south back to the Studio. The Studio has a fondue on the floor. The user's last action was going south, which brought them back to the Studio. Now, they're asking if they're making the right moves and if they're close to the goal.

The fondue is in the Studio, and the user needs to retrieve it. The current location is the Studio again. The next step would be to pick up the fondue. But in TextWorld, you usually need to pick up items by using the "take" command. However, the user's previous actions were all movement commands. The user might not have realized they need to pick up the fondue.

Wait, the user's instruction was to "retrieve the fondue from the floor of the studio." So the correct action now is to take the fondue. But the user's last move was going south, which brought them back to the Studio where the fondue is. So the next command should be "take fondue" to pick it up. Then, perhaps they need to exit the studio. But the user hasn't mentioned exiting yet. However, the original goal might be to get the fondue, so once picked up, they might have achieved the goal. But the game might require them to exit or do something else.

But according to the user's question, they are asking if they're close to the goal. Since the fondue is in the Studio and they're currently in the Studio, the next logical step is to take the fondue. So the correct command is "take fondue".
