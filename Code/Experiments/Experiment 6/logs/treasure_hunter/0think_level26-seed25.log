-= Shower =-
You are in a shower. A standard kind of place. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.
