Welcome to another life changing game of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. Your first objective is to make an effort to travel north. Then, pick-up the key from the floor of the vault. Alright, thanks!

-= Dish-Pit =-
You arrive in a dish-pit. An ordinary one. You can barely contain your excitement.



There is an unguarded exit to the north. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Vault =-
You've entered a vault. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

There is a key on the floor.
