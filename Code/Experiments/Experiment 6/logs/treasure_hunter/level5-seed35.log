Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! First thing I need you to do is to try to take a trip north. Then, go to the east. Then, pick up the pear from the floor of the cookery. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Laundry Place =-
Well, here we are in the laundry place. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Steam Room =-
You've just sauntered into a steam room.



There is an unguarded exit to the east. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a passkey on the floor.
