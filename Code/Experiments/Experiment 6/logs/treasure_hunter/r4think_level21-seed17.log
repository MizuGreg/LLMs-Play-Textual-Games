Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an fast paced round of TextWorld? You do! Here is your task for today. First of all, make an attempt to take a trip south. Once you do that, attempt to go to the south. Then, pick up the garlic clove from the fridge. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Scullery =-
Well how about that, you are in a place we're calling a scullery. The room is well lit.



There is an open hatch leading south. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

>                                                                                                                                -= Scullery =-0/1

go south

-= Recreation Zone =-
Well, here we are in a recreation zone.

You make out an opened safe. What a letdown! The safe is empty!

There is an open hatch leading north. There is an open gateway leading west. There is an unguarded exit to the south.



>                                                                                                                                -= Recreation Zone =-0/2
AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go south

-= Dish-Pit =-
You have fallen into a dish-pit. Not the dish-pit you'd expect. No, this is a dish-pit. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a garlic clove.

You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.
