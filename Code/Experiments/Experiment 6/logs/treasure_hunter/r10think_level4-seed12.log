Welcome to TextWorld! Here is how to play! First of all, you could, like, venture south. Okay, and then, recover the bug from the floor of the closet. Alright, thanks!

-= Vault =-
You find yourself in a vault. A normal one.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the south. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is in a text-based game, moving between different rooms like a vault, closet, cookhouse, and workshop. The goal seems to be to reach the original destination, maybe the exit or a specific location.

Looking at the history, the user has been moving back and forth between the cookhouse and workshop. The clues mention a bug in the closet and a durian, but the main goal isn't clear. The user's previous actions were going south, north, west, etc., but they might be stuck in a loop.

The current room is the cookhouse again, with an exit to the east and north. The user has been going north and south repeatedly. Maybe the correct path is to go east from the cookhouse? But the user hasn't tried that yet. Alternatively, maybe the bug in the closet is part of the goal, but the user has already left the closet.

Wait, the original instruction mentioned recovering the bug from the closet. The user entered the closet, saw the bug, and then went back. But the goal might be to collect the bug and exit. However, the user hasn't picked it up yet. But in the game's context, maybe the bug is a key or something. However, the user's actions so far have been moving between rooms without interacting with objects.

The user is now in the cookhouse again. The next step might be to check the east exit. But the user hasn't tried going east yet. Alternatively, maybe the correct path is to go north again, but that leads back to the workshop. The user might be stuck in a loop between cookhouse and workshop. Maybe the correct exit is east from the cookhouse. Let me check the previous steps.

In the cookhouse, the user has an exit to the east and north. The user has been going north and south, but maybe the east exit is the way out. However, the user hasn't tried that yet. So the next action should be to go east. But the user's previous moves were going north and south, so maybe the correct path is east. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to collect the bug first. But in the closet, the user saw the bug but didn't pick it up. However, the game's instructions might require that. But the user's last action was going north again, leading back to the workshop. So perhaps the user needs to go east from the cookhouse. Let me think: the user is in the cookhouse, and the east exit is unblocked. So the next step should be to go east. That's the logical next move.
