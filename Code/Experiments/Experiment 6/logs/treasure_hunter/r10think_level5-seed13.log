You are now playing a fast paced game of TextWorld! First of all, you could, like, travel north. And then, make an effort to go west. And then, retrieve the passkey from the floor of the bar. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Canteen =-
Well, here we are in the canteen.



There is an unguarded exit to the north. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

There is a cauliflower on the floor.

-= Closet =-
You are in an usual kind of place. That is to say, you're in a closet. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.



You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.
