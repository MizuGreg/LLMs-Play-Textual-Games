Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. Your first objective is to head east. Okay, and then, travel north. With that over with, try to take a trip west. After that, make an attempt to go west. After that, recover the broom from the floor of the attic. Got that? Good!

-= Cubicle =-
You're now in the cubicle. You begin to take stock of what's here.

Oh, great. Here's a stand. But there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You can make out a shelf. The shelf is typical. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Silly shelf, silly, empty, good for nothing shelf.

There is an open gate leading east. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south. There is an unblocked exit to the west.
