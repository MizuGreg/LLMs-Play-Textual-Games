I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is how to play! First thing I need you to do is to try to venture west. And then, make an attempt to go west. Okay, and then, travel south. Then, make an effort to go south. Once you get through with that, head south. After that, move south. And then, retrieve the key from the floor of the canteen. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Chamber =-
You've entered a chamber. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.



You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

-= Shower =-
You've entered a shower.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a safe. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a shelf. The shelf is normal. But there isn't a thing on it.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the north.

-= Study =-
Okay, so you're in a study, cool, but is it ordinary? You better believe it is.

Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a desk. The desk is standard. But there isn't a thing on it.

There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an unguarded exit to the south.
