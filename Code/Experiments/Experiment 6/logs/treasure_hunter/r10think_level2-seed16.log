Welcome to another exciting game of TextWorld! Pick up the fondue from the floor of the studio.

-= Studio =-
A rusty sign tells you that you are now in the studio. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

There is a fondue on the floor.
