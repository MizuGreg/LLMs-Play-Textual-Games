It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, you could, like, look and see that the walnut gate is wide open. After that, make an attempt to take a trip west. Then, go south. And then, pick-up the latchkey from the floor of the closet. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Bathroom =-
You've come into a typical room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be typical. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the bathroom.

You make out a cabinet. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a drawer. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a trunk.

There is a closed walnut gate leading west. There is an open passageway leading south.

-= Office =-
You've just sauntered into an office.



There is an open walnut gate leading east. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what to do next. The user is in the Office room now. The goal was to pick up the latchkey from the closet after going west, south, etc. Let me recap the steps.

First, they started in the bathroom, looked west (but nothing was there), tried to go west but had to open the walnut gate. They opened it, went west into the Office. Now, the Office has an open walnut gate leading east and a south entranceway that's unguarded. The original plan was to go west (which they did, opening the gate), then go south. Wait, in the initial instructions, after going west, they needed to go south. But in the current room (Office), the south is unguarded. So maybe they should go south from here.

But wait, the user's previous action was "go west" after opening the gate, which led them to the Office. Now, in the Office, the next step according to the original plan was to go south. The user is asking if they're on the right track. The answer is yes. So the next action should be to go south from the Office. That's the next step in the sequence. The user needs to go south from the Office, then pick up the latchkey from the closet. So the next command is "go south".
</think>go south

-= Closet =-
You find yourself in a closet. An ordinary one. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You see a stand. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north.

There is a latchkey on the floor.
