It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! First step, take a trip east. Once you finish that, try to go north. Once you accomplish that, head east. After that, make an effort to travel north. With that done, venture east. If you can accomplish that, venture south. With that accomplished, head south. Okay, and then, make an effort to take a trip south. And then, recover the mop from the floor of the laundry place. And if you do that, you're the winner!

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game called TextWorld, and they've been moving through different rooms: office, cellar, laundromat, bedroom, cubicle, cookery, and back to the bedroom. The goal mentioned earlier was to recover the mop from the laundry place and then reach the final goal.

Looking at the current room, it's the bedroom again. The user has a chest here. The original goal was to get the mop from the laundry place, which is the laundromat. But in the laundromat, the user found a table with nothing on it. The mop wasn't there. So maybe the mop is in another location?

Wait, the user has been moving east, north, south, west, and back. The current room is the bedroom. The chest in the bedroom might be where the mop is? Or maybe the mop is in another room. Let me check the previous rooms.

In the laundromat, there was a table but nothing on it. The exit to the east was a portal, then they went to the cookery, then west back to the bedroom. The chest in the bedroom might be the place where the mop is. But the user hasn't interacted with the chest yet. The instructions said to recover the mop from the laundry place, but maybe the mop is in the bedroom's chest?

Alternatively, maybe the mop is in the laundromat, but the user didn't check the table properly. Wait, the laundromat's table was described as "ordinary" with nothing on it. So maybe the mop is in the chest in the bedroom. The user needs to open the chest to get the mop. But the user hasn't done that yet. The current room is the bedroom, and the chest is there. So the next step would be to open the chest and take the mop. But the user's previous actions were moving around, and the goal was to get the mop from the laundry place. Hmm, maybe there's confusion here.

Wait, the original goal was to "recover the mop from the floor of the laundry place." So the mop should be in the laundromat's floor. But in the laundromat, the table was empty. Maybe the mop is on the floor, but the user didn't check. However, in the laundromat description, it says "there's nothing on this piece of garbage" (the table). But the floor might have the mop. However, the user hasn't checked the floor yet. But in the laundromat, the exits are east, south, west. The user went east to cookery, then west back to bedroom. So maybe the mop is in the laundromat, but the user hasn't looked properly. But how to get it?

Alternatively, maybe the mop is in the chest in the bedroom. The user needs to open the chest. The user's last action was going east from the cookery to the bedroom. So the next step would be to check the chest. But the user hasn't interacted with it yet. The instruction says to "recover the mop from the floor of the laundry place," so maybe the mop is in the laundromat, but the user needs to go back to the laundromat and check the floor. But the user is currently in the bedroom. So the user needs to go back to the laundromat, perhaps through the south exit from the bedroom. Let me check the bedroom's exits: north, south, west, and east. The user can go south to the laundromat again. Then check the floor for the mop. But the user hasn't done that yet. However, in the laundromat, the table was empty. Maybe the mop is on the floor, but the user hasn't checked. So the user should go back to the laundromat and look for the mop on the floor. But the user is currently in the bedroom. So the next action would be to go south to the laundromat again, then check the floor. But the user's previous steps didn't mention checking the floor. Alternatively, maybe the mop is in the chest in the bedroom. The user needs to open the chest. The user hasn't done that yet. The chest is in the bedroom. So the next action would be to open the chest. But the user hasn't interacted with it. The user's last action was going east to the bedroom. So the next step is to check the chest. But the user's instructions said to recover the mop from the laundry place. So maybe the mop is in the laundromat, but the user needs to go back there. However, the user is in the bedroom now. So the correct next step would be to go south to the laundromat again, then check the floor. But the user hasn't done that yet. Alternatively, maybe the mop is in the chest, and the user needs to open it. But the original goal was to get it from the laundry place. This is confusing. Maybe the user needs to go back to the laundromat and check the floor again. So the next action is to go south from the bedroom to the laundromat, then check the floor. But the user is in the bedroom, so the next command would be "go south" to return to the laundromat. Then, perhaps, the mop is on the floor. But the user hasn't checked that yet. So the next action is to go south to the laundromat again.

Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is trying to recover the mop from the laundry place, which is the laundromat. They've been moving through different rooms, ending up in the bedroom where there's a chest. They tried opening the chest but couldn't find the mop. The mop wasn't on the table in the laundromat, so maybe it's in the chest. But when they opened the chest, there was nothing. Wait, maybe the mop is in the scullery or another room. The user went back to the laundromat via the scullery and then back to the bedroom. Maybe they need to check other areas. Alternatively, maybe the mop is in the cookery or studio. But the user hasn't checked those yet. The next step might be to go back to the laundromat and check the floor again, or maybe the mop is in the scullery. But the user is in the bedroom now. The correct action would be to go back to the laundromat and look for the mop on the floor. So the next command should be "go south" to return to the laundromat.
