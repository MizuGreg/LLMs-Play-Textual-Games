Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First, it would be fantastic if you could attempt to venture north. That done, make an attempt to go north. Next, lift the key from the floor of the kitchen. That's it!

-= Dish-Pit =-
Ah, the dish-pit. This is some kind of dish-pit, really great standard vibes in this place, a wonderful standard atmosphere. And now, well, you're in it.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.
