Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First stop, make an attempt to go to the west. And then, make an attempt to venture north. After that, make an effort to venture west. Once you succeed at that, head south. And then, pick-up the chocolate bar from the floor of the chamber. Alright, thanks!

-= Bedroom =-
You arrive in a bedroom. An usual one.

You can see an opened box here. The box is empty! What a waste of a day! You see a coffer!

You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Cookhouse =-
Ah, the cookhouse. This is some kind of cookhouse, really great normal vibes in this place, a wonderful normal atmosphere. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.



There is an unguarded exit to the east. There is an unblocked exit to the north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and collect a chocolate bar. The current room is the Cookhouse, and they've already gone west from the Bedroom. The next steps according to the initial instructions were to go west again, then north, then south, and finally pick up the chocolate bar.

Looking at the current room description, the Cookhouse has exits to the east and north. The user's last action was going west from the Bedroom, which led them to the Cookhouse. Now, the next step in the plan is to venture west again. But wait, the Cookhouse's description says there's an unguarded exit to the east and an unblocked exit to the north. Wait, the user is in the Cookhouse, and the previous room was the Bedroom. The user's next action was to go west from the Bedroom, which led to the Cookhouse. Now, the user needs to go west again from the Cookhouse. But the Cookhouse's description says there's an unguarded exit to the east and an unblocked exit to the north. Wait, maybe there's a confusion here. Let me check the room descriptions again.

In the Cookhouse, the user is told that there's an unguarded exit to the east and an unblocked exit to the north. The user's next action is to go west, but the Cookhouse's description doesn't mention a west exit. Wait, maybe the user is supposed to go north next. But according to the initial instructions, after going west from the Bedroom, the next step was to go north. But in the Cookhouse, the user can go north or east. Wait, maybe the user is in the Cookhouse, and the next step is to go north. But the original plan was to go west, then north, then west again, then south, then pick up the chocolate.

Wait, the user's initial instructions were: first go west (from Bedroom to Cookhouse), then north, then west again, then south, then pick up the chocolate. But in the Cookhouse, the user can go north or east. So maybe after going west to the Cookhouse, the next step is to go north. But the user's next action was to go west again, but the Cookhouse doesn't have a west exit. Wait, maybe the user is supposed to go north from the Cookhouse. But the user's previous action was to go west from the Bedroom, leading to the Cookhouse. Now, the next step in the plan is to go north. But the user is in the Cookhouse, and the description says there's an unblocked exit to the north. So the user should go north. But the user's next action was to go west again, which might not be possible. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the direction. But according to the initial instructions, after going west from the Bedroom, the next step is to go north. So the user should go north from the Cookhouse. But the user's last action was to go west again, which might not be correct. However, the user's previous message said that after going west from the Bedroom, they went to the Cookhouse, and now the next step is to go north. But the user's next action was to go west again, which is not possible. So perhaps the user is confused. But according to the initial instructions, the user should go west, then north, then west again, then south, then pick up the chocolate. So maybe the user is in the Cookhouse and needs to go north. But the user's next action was to go west again, which is not possible. Therefore, the correct next action is to go north. But the user's previous action was to go west again, which might be incorrect. However, the user's current room is the Cookhouse, and the user is supposed to go north. So the correct next action is to go north. But the user's previous message said that after going west, they should go north. Therefore, the user should go north now.
</think>go north

-= Study =-
You are in a study. A typical kind of place.



There is an unblocked exit to the south. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

Okay, let's see. The user is navigating through different rooms in a text-based game. The original goal was to go west, then north, then west again, then south, and pick up the chocolate bar.

So far, they've gone from the Bedroom to the Cookhouse (west), then to the Study (north). Now, in the Study, the exits are south and west. The next step according to the original plan was to go west again. But wait, the user's previous action was going north from the Cookhouse to the Study. Now, in the Study, the unblocked exits are south and west. The next step in the original instructions was to venture west again. So the next action should be to go west from the Study. That would take them to the next room, which might be the next part of the path. Then after that, they need to go south and pick up the chocolate bar. So the next command is go west.

-= Kitchenette =-
I just think it's great that you've just entered a kitchenette.

You can see a freezer.

There is an open hatch leading north. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.



>                                                                                                                                -= Kitchenette =-0/4

Okay, let's see. The user has been moving through different rooms: bedroom, cookhouse, study, and now kitchenette. The original goal was to go west, then north, then west again, then south, and pick up the chocolate bar.

So far, the path taken is: bedroom (west) → cookhouse (north) → study (west) → kitchenette. Now, the next step after kitchenette would be to go south, as per the original plan. The user is in the kitchenette, and the exits are north, east, south. The instruction says after going west (from study to kitchenette), then head south. So the next action should be south. Then, after that, pick up the chocolate bar. But the current step is to go south from kitchenette. So the next command is "go south".

-= Chamber =-
You make another one of your grand eccentric entrances into a chamber.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the north.

There is a chocolate bar on the floor.


>                                                                                                                                -= Chamber =-0/5

Okay, let's see. The user has been moving through different rooms in the game: bedroom, cookhouse, study, kitchenette, and now the chamber. The original goal was to go west, then north, then west again, then south, and finally pick up the chocolate bar.

So far, the user has successfully gone west from the bedroom to the cookhouse, then north to the study, west to the kitchenette, and south back to the chamber. The next step according to the original plan is to pick up the chocolate bar. In the chamber, there's a chocolate bar on the floor. Since the user is now in the chamber, the next action should be to pick it up. The command would be "take chocolate bar" or something similar. But the user's previous actions were all "go" commands. However, in the chamber, the chocolate bar is on the floor, so the correct action here is to pick it up. The user needs to take the chocolate bar, which is the final goal.
</think>take chocolate bar
