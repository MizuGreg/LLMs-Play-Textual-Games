Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First stop, make an attempt to go to the west. And then, make an attempt to venture north. After that, make an effort to venture west. Once you succeed at that, head south. And then, pick-up the chocolate bar from the floor of the chamber. Alright, thanks!

-= Bedroom =-
You arrive in a bedroom. An usual one.

You can see an opened box here. The box is empty! What a waste of a day! You see a coffer!

You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

Ah, the cookhouse. This is some kind of cookhouse, really great normal vibes in this place, a wonderful normal atmosphere. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.
