Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an exciting round of TextWorld? You do! Here is how to play! First thing I need you to do is to make an attempt to venture north. Then, pick-up the poem from the floor of the bedchamber. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Spare Room =-
You are in a spare room. A typical one.

You can make out an opened ordinary looking cabinet in the corner. The cabinet is empty, what a horrible day!

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Bedchamber =-
You find yourself in a bedchamber. An usual kind of place.



There is an unblocked exit to the east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

There is a poem on the floor.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this TextWorld game. The goal is to pick up the poem from the bedchamber and then win. So far, they've gone north from the spare room into the bedchamber. Now, in the bedchamber, there's a poem on the floor. The prompt says to pick up the poem to win.

The current location is the bedchamber. The user needs to pick up the poem. The previous action was going north, which brought them here. Now, the next step is to pick up the poem. The command should be "take poem" or "pick up poem". But in TextWorld, the correct command might be "take poem" since that's the standard verb for picking up items. Let me check the previous interactions. The user was told to "pick-up the poem from the floor of the bedchamber." So the correct action is to take the poem. The next command should be "take poem".
</think>take poem
