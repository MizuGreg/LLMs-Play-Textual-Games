You are now playing a fast paced round of TextWorld! First thing I need you to do is to make an effort to go east. And then, attempt to move south. Then, make an attempt to go south. That done, go east. After that, lift the frisbee from the floor of the closet. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Cellar =-

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. There is an unblocked exit to the south. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

You find yourself in a cookhouse. A standard kind of place.



There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing a text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and perform specific actions to win. The goal mentioned is to lift a frisbee from the closet after moving in certain directions.

First, the user started in the Cellar. The initial instructions were to go east, then attempt to move south twice, then east again. After that, lift the frisbee from the closet. The user followed the first step by going east, which led them to the Cookhouse. Now, they're in the Cookhouse, and the next steps according to the initial plan would be to move south, then west, but the user is asking if they're on the right track and what their next action should be.

Looking at the current room, the Cookhouse has exits to the south and west. The user's next move should be to go south as per the initial plan. The user might be confused because the instructions said to go east first, then south twice, then east again. But in the Cookhouse, moving south would take them to the next room. The user needs to follow the sequence: east (to Cookhouse), south, south, east, then lift the frisbee. So the next step is to go south from the Cookhouse. The user's next action should be "go south".
</think>go south

-= Pantry =-
You've entered a pantry. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You scan the room for a safe, and you find a safe. The safe is empty, what a horrible day!

There is an open gate leading south. There is an unguarded exit to the east. There is an unblocked exit to the north. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and eventually lift a frisbee from a closet. The goal is to go east, then south twice, then east again, and then lift the frisbee.

So far, the user has gone east from the cellar to the cookhouse, then south to the pantry. Now, in the pantry, the options are south, east, north, or west. The提示 says there's an open gate south, unguarded exit east, unblocked north, and suggests trying west if needed.

The next step according to the original plan was after going east, then south twice. But the user has already done east (cellar -> cookhouse), then south (cookhouse -> pantry). Now they need to go south again from the pantry. But the pantry's south is an open gate. So the next action should be south again. However, the user might be confused because the pantry's south is open, but maybe that's part of the path. Alternatively, maybe the correct path is to go east from the pantry, but the original plan said after going east, then south twice. Wait, the original instructions were: go east, then attempt to move south, then make an attempt to go south again. Then go east. Then lift the frisbee.

So after the pantry, the user needs to go south again. But in the pantry, the south is an open gate. So the next command should be go south. But the user is at the pantry, and the next step is to go south. However, the user might have to check if that's the correct path. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east first. But according to the original plan, after the initial east, then two souths, then east again. So in the pantry, after entering, the next step is to go south again. So the correct action here is go south.
</think>go south

-= Cookery =-
You are in a cookery. An ordinary kind of place. Let's see what's in here.

You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a rack. You wonder idly who left that here. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well

There is an open gate leading north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. There is an unguarded exit to the south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.



>                                                                                                                                -= Cookery =-0/4

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and eventually lift the frisbee from the closet. The goal is to go east, then south twice, then east again, and then lift the frisbee.

So far, the user has gone east from the cellar to the cookhouse, then south to the pantry, then south again to the cookery. Now, the current room is the cookery. The instructions say after going east, then south, then east, they need to lift the frisbee. 

Wait, the user's previous actions were: go east (cellar -> cookhouse), then go south (cookhouse -> pantry), then go south again (pantry -> cookery). Now, the next step according to the initial plan was to go east again. But in the current room (cookery), the available exits are north, east, south, and west. The prompt says "You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east." So the next action should be to go east from the cookery.

But let me check the current room description again. In the cookery, there's an open gate leading north, an unguarded exit to the south, an exit to the west (unblocked), and the user is advised to try going east. So going east is the next step. After that, they would move to the next room. Then, after that, they need to lift the frisbee from the closet. So the next action here is definitely go east.

-= Closet =-
You find yourself in a closet. A normal kind of place.



There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

There is a frisbee on the floor.


>                                                                                                                                -= Closet =-0/5

Okay, let's see. The user has been moving through different rooms in the game: cellar, cookhouse, pantry, cookery, and now the closet. The goal is to lift the frisbee from the floor of the closet and win.

So far, the user has gone east from the cookery to reach the closet. The current room is the closet, and there's a frisbee on the floor. The previous steps involved moving south, east, etc., but now they're in the closet. The next step mentioned in the instructions was to lift the frisbee. But the user hasn't done that yet. The prompt says to "lift the frisbee from the floor of the closet. And if you do that, you're the winner!" So the next action should be to pick up the frisbee. However, the user's last action was going west, but the current room is the closet. Wait, the user's last command was "go east" which led them to the closet. Now, in the closet, the frisbee is on the floor. The correct action here is to pick up the frisbee. The user needs to use the command "take frisbee" or something similar. But the game's possible commands might be limited. In TextWorld, the usual commands are directions and taking items. So the correct command here is "take frisbee" to lift it. The user needs to do that to win. The previous steps were moving through the rooms, and now the final step is to take the frisbee. So the next action should be "take frisbee".
</think>take frisbee
