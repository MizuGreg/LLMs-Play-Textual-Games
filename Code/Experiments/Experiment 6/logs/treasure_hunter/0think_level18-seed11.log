You are now playing a fast paced episode of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to make an attempt to move west. That done, move south. After that, pick-up the teaspoon from the floor of the cookhouse. Got that? Good!

-= Workshop =-
You find yourself in a workshop. An ordinary one.

You make out a locker. The locker is empty! What a waste of a day!

There is an open gate leading south. There is an open door leading west.

GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Cookhouse =-
You arrive in a standard kind of place. That is to say, you're in a cookhouse.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a teaspoon on the floor.
