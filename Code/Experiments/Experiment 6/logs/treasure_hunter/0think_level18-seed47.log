You are now playing a exciting session of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First of all, take a trip north. With that accomplished, make an attempt to travel west. Next, move south. Then, venture west. After that, ensure that the passageway is open. Then, go south. Then, make an attempt to head east. If you can accomplish that, pick up the key from the floor of the closet. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Kitchenette =-
You arrive in a kitchenette. A standard kind of place. You begin looking for stuff.

You make out a shelf. You wonder idly who left that here. However, the shelf, like an empty shelf, has nothing on it. Silly shelf, silly, empty, good for nothing shelf.

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.
