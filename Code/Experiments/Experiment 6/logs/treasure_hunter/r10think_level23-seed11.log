I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First, it would be a great idea if you could take a trip east. After that, head east. Then, travel south. Following that, go east. Following that, make an effort to move east. Then, try to head north. Okay, and then, pick-up the Comic Strip Calendar from the floor of the workshop. And if you do that, you're the winner!

You're now in the shower.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text adventure game called TextWorld. Their goal is to navigate through different rooms and eventually pick up the Comic Strip Calendar from the workshop. 

Looking at the history of commands, the user has been moving east and west between the Cookhouse and Office rooms. The game seems to be looping between these two rooms, with the user repeatedly going east and west. The instruction mentioned earlier was to first go east, then east again, then south, then east, then north, and finally pick up the Comic Strip Calendar from the workshop.

Wait, the user hasn't reached the workshop yet. The current location is the Cookhouse, and the next step according to the initial instructions was to go north from the Cookhouse. But in the game's current state, the Cookhouse has an unblocked exit to the north. So maybe the user needs to go north from the Cookhouse to reach the workshop. 

But in the previous steps, the user kept going back and forth between Cookhouse and Office. The user might be stuck in a loop. The initial plan was to go east, then east again, then south, then east, then north. But after going south from the Bedroom, they ended up in the Cookhouse. Then they kept moving east and west, which might not be following the original path.

Wait, the original instructions said: first, take a trip east. Then head east again. Then travel south. Then east again. Then try to head north. Then pick up the Comic Strip Calendar from the workshop. So after traveling south, the next step was to go east again. But in the current state, the user is in the Cookhouse, and the next step should be to go north to reach the workshop. However, the workshop hasn't been mentioned yet. Maybe the workshop is in the north direction from the Cookhouse.

Alternatively, maybe the workshop is in the Office room? But the user hasn't found the Comic Strip Calendar yet. The user needs to find the workshop where the calendar is on the floor. So perhaps after going north from the Cookhouse, they'll reach the workshop. But the user hasn't tried that yet. 

In the current step, the user is in the Cookhouse, and the game says there's an unblocked exit to the north. So the next logical step is to go north to reach the workshop. Then, once in the workshop, pick up the calendar. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action should be to go north from the Cookhouse.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out what's going on here. The user is stuck in a loop between the Cookhouse and Bedroom, moving back and forth. The original goal was to pick up the Comic Strip Calendar from the workshop. But so far, the user hasn't reached the workshop yet.

Looking at the previous steps, after going north from the Cookhouse, they end up in the Bedroom again. Then going south takes them back to Cookhouse. This suggests that the workshop might be in a different direction. Maybe the user needs to find another path. 

Wait, the initial instructions said to go east, then east again, then south, then east, then north. But the user has been going back and forth between Cookhouse and Bedroom. Maybe the workshop is in the east direction from the Cookhouse. The Cookhouse has an exit to the east, which the user hasn't tried yet. 

In the current state, the user is in the Cookhouse, and the game says there's an unblocked exit to the east. So the next step should be to go east from the Cookhouse. That might lead to the workshop where the calendar is. Let me check the previous steps. The user tried going north from Cookhouse but ended up in the Bedroom. So maybe east is the correct direction now.

You find yourself in an office. An ordinary one. The room is well lit.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

Okay, the user is trying to navigate through the TextWorld game. Their goal is to pick up the Comic Strip Calendar from the workshop. So far, they've been moving between the Cookhouse, Bedroom, and Office, but haven't found the workshop yet.

Looking at the current location, they're in the Office. The game mentions an exit to the east and a west entrance. The user has been going back and forth between east and west, which might not be leading them closer to the workshop. The initial instructions said to go east, then east again, then south, then east, then north. But the user hasn't followed that exact path yet.

Wait, in the previous steps, the user tried going east from the Cookhouse, which led them to the Office. Now, in the Office, the exit to the east is unguarded. Maybe the workshop is in that direction. But the user needs to check if there's a way to get to the workshop from the Office. Alternatively, maybe the workshop is in the north from the Cookhouse, but the user keeps getting stuck in the loop.

The user needs to find the workshop where the calendar is. Since the workshop hasn't been mentioned yet, perhaps the correct path is to continue moving east from the Office. But the user should also check if there's a way to reach the workshop through other exits. However, based on the current information, the next logical step is to go east from the Office. But the user might be missing something. Alternatively, maybe the workshop is in the west direction from the Office. But the user has been going west before, leading back to the Cookhouse.

Wait, the initial instructions said to go north after moving east several times. The user might need to go north from the Cookhouse to reach the workshop. But in the current state, the user is in the Office. Maybe the workshop is in the east direction from the Office. The user should try going east again. But the game says the exit to the east is unguarded. So the next action should be to go east from the Office. That might lead to the workshop. Let me check the previous steps. The user went from Cookhouse to Office by going east. Now, in the Office, going east again could be the next step. But the user needs to make sure they're following the correct path. Alternatively, maybe the workshop is in the north from the Cookhouse, but the user is stuck in a loop. However, the user hasn't tried going north from the Cookhouse again. But earlier attempts led them back to the Bedroom. So maybe the workshop is in the east direction from the Office. The user should go east again.
