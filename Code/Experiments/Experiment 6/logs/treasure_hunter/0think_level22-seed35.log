It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, you could, like, venture north. Then, make an effort to take a trip west. Then, make an effort to move north. Next, try to take a trip north. Then, recover the loaf of bread from the floor of the cellar. And if you do that, you're the winner!

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a portmanteau. The portmanteau is empty, what a horrible day!

There is an open gate leading east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

You make out a chair. The chair is ordinary. The chair appears to be empty. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a saucepan. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.
