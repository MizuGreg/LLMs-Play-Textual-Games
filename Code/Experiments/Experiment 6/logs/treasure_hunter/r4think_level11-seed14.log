Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an life changing round of TextWorld? You do! Here is your task for today. First of all, make an effort to move east. After that, recover the butterfly from the box inside the workshop. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Chamber =-
You find yourself in a chamber. An ordinary one.



There is an open gateway leading south. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Workshop =-
You've just shown up in a workshop.

You can see a box. The box contains a butterfly. You make out a locker. You can see a portmanteau.

You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

That's already open.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me figure out what to do next. The user is in the Workshop, which they just entered after going east from the Chamber. The workshop has a box with a butterfly, a locker, and a portmanteau. The previous action was trying to open the box, but it's already open. The goal is to recover the butterfly from the box inside the workshop.

Wait, the user already opened the box, and the butterfly is inside. So maybe the next step is to take the butterfly. But the game might require interacting with the box first. Let me check the previous messages again.

In the Workshop description, it says the box contains a butterfly. The user tried to open the box, but it's already open. So maybe the butterfly is already in the box, and the next step is to pick it up. But the game might have specific commands for that. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to interact with the box in another way.

Alternatively, maybe the butterfly is not in the box but in the workshop, and the box is just a container. But according to the description, the box contains the butterfly. So the correct action would be to take the butterfly from the box. But the user already opened the box. So perhaps the next step is to take the butterfly.

But the game might require using the 'take' command. Let me check the possible commands. The user is in the Workshop, and the box is open. The butterfly is inside. So the next action should be to take the butterfly. However, the user's previous action was 'open box', which was already open. So maybe the next step is to take the butterfly.

But the user's last message was "That's already open." So the game is indicating that the box is already open, so the butterfly is accessible. Therefore, the next action should be to take the butterfly. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the correct command would be 'take butterfly' or 'get butterfly'.

Alternatively, maybe the game requires interacting with the box first. But since the box is already open, the user can take the butterfly directly. So the next action is to take the butterfly from the box.
