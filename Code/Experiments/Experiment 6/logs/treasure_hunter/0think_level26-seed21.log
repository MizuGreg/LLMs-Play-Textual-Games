It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! First of all, try to head west. Then, venture west. Okay, and then, try to take a trip north. With that accomplished, head east. Okay, and then, pick up the TextWorld style passkey from the floor of the workshop. If you have got the TextWorld style passkey, venture south. After that, assure that the TextWorld style gate in the sauna is unlocked. After unlocking the TextWorld style gate, ensure that the TextWorld style gate is open. After that, go south. Then, make an attempt to take a trip south. That done, make an attempt to head south. Okay, and then, lift the key from the floor of the canteen. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Cookhouse =-
I just think it's awesome that you're in a cookhouse now.

You see a chest. Hmmm... what else, what else?

There is an unguarded exit to the north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.
