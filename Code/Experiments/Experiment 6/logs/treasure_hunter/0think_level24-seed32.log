Welcome to another fast paced round of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First off, attempt to travel north. With that over with, try to take a trip east. Then, retrieve the Microsoft latchkey from the floor of the bathroom. And then, make an effort to go to the south. Next, check that the Microsoft portal is unlocked with the Microsoft latchkey. And then, ensure that the Microsoft portal is open. And then, take a trip south. Once you accomplish that, venture south. Once you succeed at that, pick-up the passkey from the floor of the kitchen. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Sauna =-
You arrive in a sauna. A standard kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a trunk, so there's that. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a board. The board is typical. The board appears to be empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked.
