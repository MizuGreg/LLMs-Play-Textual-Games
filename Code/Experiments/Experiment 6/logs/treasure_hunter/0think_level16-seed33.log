Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First, it would be great if you could try to take a trip south. And then, head east. Then, go to the north. Next, go to the north. With that done, go west. After that, pick-up the loaf of bread from the floor of the study. And if you do that, you're the winner!
