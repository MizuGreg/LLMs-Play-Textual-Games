Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First off, make an effort to travel east. Then, make an attempt to move north. Then, pick-up the key from the floor of the vault. Got that? Good!

-= Spare Room =-
You find yourself in a spare room. A standard one.



There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go east

-= Dish-Pit =-
You arrive in a dish-pit. An ordinary one. You can barely contain your excitement.



There is an unguarded exit to the north. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go north
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Vault =-
You've entered a vault. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

There is a key on the floor.


>                                                                                                                                -= Vault =-0/3
