Welcome to TextWorld! Here is your task for today. Your first objective is to venture west. And then, go to the north. Once you get through with that, go east. With that accomplished, pick up the passkey from the floor of the office. That's it!

You find yourself in a lounge. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

You smell an intriguing smell, and follow it to a bar. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You can make out a mantelpiece. The mantelpiece is standard. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the mantelpiece! oh well.

There is an open passageway leading south. There is an open portal leading west. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north.
