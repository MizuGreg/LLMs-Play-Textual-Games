Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First off, attempt to move north. Then, try to take a trip west. And then, move south. Once you manage that, retrieve the passkey from the floor of the cookery. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Restroom =-
You're now in a restroom.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a cucumber on the floor.
