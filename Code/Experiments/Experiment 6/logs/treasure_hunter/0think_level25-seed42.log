It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. Your first objective is to try to go east. After that, make an effort to go east. Then, lift the keycard from the floor of the closet. Then, go to the west. And then, unlock the hatch. After unlocking the hatch, open the hatch in the salon. And then, make an effort to head north. If you can do that, go north. With that accomplished, move north. With that over with, make an attempt to take a trip west. And then, retrieve the grape from the floor of the bathroom. And if you do that, you're the winner!
