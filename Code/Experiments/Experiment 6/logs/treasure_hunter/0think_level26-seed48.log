Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, try to take a trip south. Once you accomplish that, attempt to move west. Then, take a trip west. And then, go to the north. And then, make an attempt to take a trip west. Next, attempt to go to the south. And then, lift the latchkey from the floor of the kitchenette. That's it!

-= Launderette =-
You are in a launderette. A typical one. Let's see what's in here.

You make out a drawer. The drawer is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You see a shelf. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

There is a closed hatch leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.
