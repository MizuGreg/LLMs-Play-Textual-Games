Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First, it would be fantastic if you could make an effort to head north. If you can succeed at that, travel west. With that over with, try to take a trip west. After that, lift the broom from the floor of the attic. And if you do that, you're the winner!
