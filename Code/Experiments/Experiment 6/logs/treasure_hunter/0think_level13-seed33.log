I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First, it would be a great idea if you could try to take a trip north. And then, head north. Then, go to the west. Next, recover the loaf of bread from the floor of the study. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Bedroom =-
Ah, the bedroom. This is some kind of bedroom, really great standard vibes in this place, a wonderful standard atmosphere. And now, well, you're in it.

You can see a bar. The bar is typical. The bar appears to be empty.

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go north
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. A typical one.

You see a pan. The pan is normal. The pan appears to be empty. Hey, want to see a counter? Look over there, a counter. The counter appears to be empty.

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

-= Washroom =-
You arrive in a washroom. An ordinary kind of place.

You see a cabinet. You make out a table. The table is typical. However, the table, like an empty table, has nothing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You can see a bench. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is an unguarded exit to the south. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go west

-= Study =-
You're now in the study. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You make out a mantle. Now why would someone leave that there? The mantle is usual. However, the mantle, like an empty mantle, has nothing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the mantle! oh well.

There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

There is a loaf of bread on the floor.
