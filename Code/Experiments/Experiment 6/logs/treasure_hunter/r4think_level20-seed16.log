Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, you could, like, make an effort to move east. Then, move south. Then, ensure that the hatch within the cellar is open. After that, head south. And then, open the portal. And then, attempt to head south. Then, move west. With that accomplished, make an effort to go to the north. Following that, go west. Then, pick up the peanut from the floor of the studio. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Canteen =-
You find yourself in a canteen. A typical one. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."

You can make out a platter. The platter is typical. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a table. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You think about smashing the table to bits, throwing the bits into a pit, etc, until you get bored.

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east.

There is a candy bar on the floor.

-= Pantry =-
You've entered a pantry. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

An open chest is close by. The chest is empty, what a horrible day! Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. But the thing is empty. Look over there! a shelf. The shelf is normal. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

There is an open gate leading south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

There is an open hatch leading north. There is a closed portal leading south.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game and has followed a set of instructions. They've moved east, then south, opened the hatch, went south again, and now they're in the basement. The next steps according to the initial instructions were to open the portal, then go south, then west, north, west again, pick up the peanut, and win.

In the current basement, there's a closed portal leading south. The user's next step should be to open that portal. The previous actions involved opening the hatch, so following the same pattern, opening the portal makes sense. After opening it, they need to go south, then west, etc. So the correct command here is to open the portal.

GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

You open portal.

Well, here we are in a kitchenette.



There is an open portal leading north. There is an open passageway leading west.

-= Cubicle =-
Guess what, you are in the place we're calling the cubicle. You begin looking for stuff.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a safe. You can see a closed locker. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a desk. But the thing is empty.

There is an open passageway leading east. There is an open gateway leading north. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps given in the initial instructions. They moved east, south, opened the hatch, went south again, opened the portal, went south once more to the kitchenette, then west to the cubicle. Now, in the cubicle, they found a safe and a desk, but the desk is empty. The next step according to the original plan was to pick up the peanut from the studio floor after moving west and north, etc.

But in the current cubicle, the user needs to find the peanut. The original instructions said to pick up the peanut from the studio. However, the current location is the cubicle. Maybe the peanut is in the safe or the locker? The user pressed a button and found a safe and a desk. The safe is closed, and there's a locker. Maybe the peanut is in the safe or locker. Alternatively, maybe the peanut is in the studio, which is part of the previous steps.

Wait, the original goal was to pick up the peanut from the studio. So the user needs to get to the studio. But the current location is the cubicle. The cubicle has an exit to the west, north, and east. The original plan was to go west, then north, then west again. But the user is in the cubicle now. Let me check the previous steps again.

The user's path so far: canteen -> pantry -> cellar -> basement -> kitchenette -> cubicle. The next step in the original instructions was after opening the portal and going south (to kitchenette), then move west (to cubicle). Then, the next steps were to go north, then west, then pick up the peanut. So from the cubicle, they need to go north, then west. But in the cubicle, there's a gateway leading north. So the next command should be go north. Then, from the north, maybe the studio is there. Alternatively, maybe the peanut is in the cubicle's safe or locker. But the user hasn't checked those yet. However, the original plan says to pick up the peanut after moving west and north. So perhaps the peanut is in the studio, which is accessible via the cubicle's north exit. So the next step is to go north from the cubicle. Then, after that, go west to the studio, pick up the peanut, and win. So the correct next action is to go north.

-= Steam Room =-
Well how about that, you are in a place we're calling a steam room. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.



There is an open gateway leading south. There is an open door leading west.

-= Studio =-
You arrive in a studio. A standard one.



There is an open door leading east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked.

There is a peanut on the floor.


>                                                                                                                                -= Studio =-0/10

Okay, the user has reached the Studio, which is the final location mentioned in the original instructions. The goal was to pick up the peanut from the studio's floor. The current description says there's a peanut on the floor. So the next step is to pick up the peanut. The command should be "take peanut" or "pick up peanut". But in TextWorld, the correct command is usually "take" followed by the item. So the next action is to take the peanut.
