Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is how to play! First thing I need you to do is to attempt to travel south. With that over with, retrieve the key from the rack within the cookhouse. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Chamber =-
You make another one of your grand eccentric entrances into a chamber.

You make out a locked standard looking trunk right there by you.

There is an open passageway leading east. There is an unblocked exit to the north. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

-= Cookhouse =-
You find yourself in a cookhouse. A typical kind of place.

You can make out a rack. On the rack you can see a key. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a pan. The pan is normal. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Hm. Oh well

There is an unblocked exit to the north.
