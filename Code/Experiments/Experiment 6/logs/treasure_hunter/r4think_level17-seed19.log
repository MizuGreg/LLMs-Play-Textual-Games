I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First, it would be good if you could attempt to travel east. Then, make an attempt to head north. After that, open the portal. After that, attempt to move west. After that, try to venture north. Then, move west. And then, pick-up the latchkey from the floor of the kitchen. And once you've done that, you win!

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this TextWorld game and has followed a set of instructions to navigate through different rooms. They've gone from the basement to the garage, then to the laundry place, opened the portal, and went west again to a cubicle. Now, they're in the cubicle, and the next steps according to the initial task were to venture north, move west, pick up the latchkey from the kitchen, and then win.

Looking at the current room, the cubicle has an open portal east, an open hatch north, and an exit south. The user's next action should be to go north, as per the task. The hatch north might lead to another area. After that, they need to move west again. But first, they need to check if the latchkey is in the kitchen. However, the current room is a cubicle, so maybe the kitchen is further north or another direction. But according to the task, after moving west from the cubicle, they should pick up the latchkey from the kitchen. Wait, the user hasn't picked up the latchkey yet. The task says to pick it up from the kitchen's floor. So maybe after going north from the cubicle, they'll find the kitchen. Alternatively, maybe the kitchen is in a different location. But the user's next step is to go north from the cubicle. Let me check the current room's description again. The cubicle has an open hatch north. So going north from here would be the next step. Then, after that, move west. Then pick up the latchkey. So the next action is to go north.
</think>go north

-= Closet =-
You've entered a closet.

You see an opened chest. What a letdown! The chest is empty!

There is an open hatch leading south. There is an open gateway leading west.



>                                                                                                                                -= Closet =-0/7

-= Kitchen =-
You're now in the kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You smell a sickening smell, and follow it to a freezer. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You make out a closed case, which looks normal, in the corner. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a table. The table is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open gateway leading east. There is an open passageway leading north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

There is a latchkey on the floor.


>                                                                                                                                -= Kitchen =-0/8

Okay, let's see. The user has reached the kitchen, and there's a latchkey on the floor. The task was to pick up the latchkey from the kitchen's floor and then win. So the next step is to pick up the latchkey. The user is in the kitchen, and the latchkey is there. The previous actions led them here, so the correct command is to pick up the latchkey. But the system might expect a specific command format. The user has to pick it up, so the next action should be "pick up latchkey".
</think>pick up latchkey
