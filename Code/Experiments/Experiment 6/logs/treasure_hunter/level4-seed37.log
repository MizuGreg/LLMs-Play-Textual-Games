You are now playing a profound session of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First of all, head south. Then, recover the teapot from the floor of the dish-pit. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Canteen =-
Look at that notice! What does it say? It says Welcome to the canteen? Well that's cool. The room is well lit.



There is an unguarded exit to the north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

-= Dish-Pit =-
Ah, the dish-pit. This is some kind of dish-pit, really great ordinary vibes in this place, a wonderful ordinary atmosphere.



There is an unblocked exit to the north.

There is a teapot on the floor.
