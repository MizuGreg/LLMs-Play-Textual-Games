Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First thing I need you to do is to try to head east. And then, doublecheck that the door inside the vault is opened. Then, go north. With that done, go north. After that, try to go to the north. With that done, attempt to go west. And then, attempt to go south. Then, travel south. After that, attempt to head west. And then, attempt to travel west. Then, attempt to go to the west. Then, recover the key from the floor of the canteen. And if you do that, you're the winner!

You're now in a cellar.

As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a shelf. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked.

There is a closed door leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.
