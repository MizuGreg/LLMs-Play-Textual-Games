Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is how to play! First of all, you could, like, make an attempt to move north. With that done, venture north. With that done, make an effort to take a trip east. And then, try to take a trip east. And then, head south. Then, go to the south. Next, go to the west. With that done, go north. After that, open the suitcase in the cubicle. Then, take the sandwich from the suitcase. And if you do that, you're the winner!
