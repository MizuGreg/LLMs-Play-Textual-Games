It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, you could, like, ensure that the door is open. And then, go to the south. And then, retrieve the key from the floor of the salon. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Cookery =-
Of every cookery you could have walked into, you had to walk into a typical one. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You see a chair. The chair is typical. The chair appears to be empty.

There is a closed door leading south. There is an open passageway leading east.
