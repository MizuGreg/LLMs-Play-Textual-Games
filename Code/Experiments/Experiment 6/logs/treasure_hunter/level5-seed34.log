Welcome to TextWorld! First of all, you could, like, venture north. And then, venture east. Okay, and then, retrieve the passkey from the floor of the pantry. Got that? Good!

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?



There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded.
