Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First step, head east. After that, recover the candy bar from the board inside the kitchen. Alright, thanks!

-= Shower =-
You find yourself in a shower. A typical kind of place. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You can see a drawer. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. What's that over there? It looks like it's a rack. The rack is standard. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. Hm. Oh well

There is an unblocked exit to the east.

go east

-= Kitchen =-
You make a grand eccentric entrance into a kitchen.

You can make out a board. On the board you can see a candy bar.

There is an open door leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.
