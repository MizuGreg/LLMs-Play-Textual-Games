I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! First stop, take a trip west. And then, lift the sandwich from the floor of the bedroom. Alright, thanks!

-= Bathroom =-
Well how about that, you are in a place we're calling a bathroom. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

-= Bedroom =-
You've just walked into a bedroom.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

There is a sandwich and a key on the floor.

That's not a verb I recognise.
