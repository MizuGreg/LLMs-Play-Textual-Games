Welcome to TextWorld! Here is how to play! First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to venture north. With that over with, take a trip west. And then, make an effort to head north. Following that, attempt to travel west. Then, lift the latchkey from the floor of the kitchen. Alright, thanks!
