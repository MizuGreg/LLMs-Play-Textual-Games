Welcome to another profound round of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to attempt to take a trip west. With that over with, make an effort to venture west. And then, attempt to go to the north. After that, lift the fondue from the floor of the office. Got that? Good!

-= Salon =-
You arrive in a salon. A typical kind of place. You start to take note of what's in the room.



There is an unguarded exit to the west.

There is a key on the floor.

You can't go that way.

You are in a pantry. A normal kind of place.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game and has been moving through different rooms. The goal mentioned earlier was to lift the fondue from the office floor. So far, they've gone west from the salon into a bar, then tried to go north but couldn't, so they went west again into a pantry.

Now, in the pantry, the prompt says there's an exit to the east, north, and south. The user is asked if they're on the right track and what their next move should be. The key here is to figure out the correct path to reach the office where the fondue is. 

Looking at the rooms visited: Salon (started here), then Bar, then Pantry. The exits from the pantry are east, north, south. The original exit from the salon was west, which led to the bar. Maybe the office is connected through another path. 

Wait, the user needs to lift the fondue from the office floor. So the office must be a room they haven't reached yet. The pantry is a possible intermediate room. Let's think about the possible connections. 

From the pantry, going east might lead back to the bar, but the bar had an exit to the east (which would be back to the salon?) or maybe another direction. Alternatively, going north or south from the pantry could lead to the office. 

But the user is in the pantry and needs to find the right exit. The prompt says "You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south." So maybe all three directions are possible, but which one leads towards the office?

Alternatively, maybe the office is connected via the pantry's north exit. Or perhaps the south exit. But without more info, the user needs to try one of them. Since the user is trying to get to the office, perhaps the correct path is to go north from the pantry. But the user has to choose one direction. 

Alternatively, maybe the office is in the south of the pantry. But the user needs to make a decision. Since the user is trying to reach the office, and the previous rooms were salon, bar, pantry, perhaps the next step is to go east from the pantry to reach the office. But I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, maybe the correct path is to go north from the pantry. But the user has to pick one. Since the user is trying to reach the office, and the previous steps were west, then north (but couldn't), then west again. Maybe the office is connected via the pantry's north exit. 

Alternatively, maybe the user should go east from the pantry. But the user needs to choose. The user's next action should be to go east, north, or south. Since the user is trying to reach the office, perhaps the correct direction is north. But the user has to make a choice. 

In the pantry, the exits are east, north, south. The user needs to pick one. Since the user is in the pantry, and the previous rooms were salon, bar, pantry, maybe the office is connected via the north exit. So the next action would be to go north.

-= Office =-

That's not a verb I recognise.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Office room, which has an unguarded exit to the south and a fondue on the floor. The previous action was trying to lift the fondue, but that wasn't a valid command. The user needs to figure out the correct action here.

First, the goal is to lift the fondue from the floor of the office. The available commands might be "take fondue" or "pick up fondue". Since "lift" wasn't recognized, maybe the correct verb is "take". So the next action should be to take the fondue. Then, after taking it, the user might need to exit or do something else. But the current step is to take the fondue. So the correct command is "take fondue".
