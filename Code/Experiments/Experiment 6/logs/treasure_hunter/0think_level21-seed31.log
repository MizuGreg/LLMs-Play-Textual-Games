Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First stop, make an effort to venture east. Okay, and then, travel north. After that, recover the durian from the floor of the shower. That's it!

-= Bedroom =-
You've entered a bedroom. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a basket. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting.

There is an open portal leading west. There is an unguarded exit to the east. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.
