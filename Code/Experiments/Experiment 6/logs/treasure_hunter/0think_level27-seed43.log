It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First off, go to the south. After that, take a trip west. That done, retrieve the type U passkey from the floor of the cookery. After that, go west. Then, make an effort to head north. After that, look and see that the type U portal within the playroom is unlocked with the type U passkey. After that, ensure that the type U portal is open. And then, attempt to go to the west. With that accomplished, make an effort to head west. And then, make an attempt to go to the south. Following that, move south. With that accomplished, travel east. If you can get around to doing that, travel east. Then, pick-up the blanket from the floor of the salon. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Shower =-
You are in a shower. An ordinary kind of place. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."



You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

-= Restroom =-
You are in a restroom. An ordinary one. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a bench. But there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the bench. You make out a counter. The counter is typical. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Cookery =-
Well, here we are in the cookery. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You make out a freezer. Now why would someone leave that there? You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a rack. The rack is typical. On the rack you make out a fork.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

There is a type U passkey on the floor.

-= Kitchenette =-
This just in- You, in the kitchenette. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You can see a closed cabinet.

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north.

-= Playroom =-
You are in a playroom. An ordinary kind of place. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

A closed box is nearby.

There is a closed type U portal leading west. There is an unguarded exit to the east. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Playroom =-
You are in a playroom. An ordinary kind of place. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

A closed box is nearby.

There is a closed type U portal leading west. There is an unguarded exit to the east. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.
