-= Attic =-
You are in an attic. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You can see a stand. Now why would someone leave that there? But there isn't a thing on it.

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Shower =-
You are in a shower. A standard kind of place.

You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a drawer. You can make out a basket. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? Oh, great. Here's a shelf. However, the shelf, like an empty shelf, has nothing on it. You move on, clearly done caring about your TextWorld experience. You see a board. You see a passkey on the board. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a bench. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is an unguarded exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.
