I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. Your first objective is to go to the west. And then, head north. And then, pick-up the book from the floor of the workshop. Alright, thanks!

-= Playroom =-
You are in a playroom. A normal one.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Lounge =-
You've entered a typical room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be typical. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the lounge. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.
