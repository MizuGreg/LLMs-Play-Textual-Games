Welcome to TextWorld! Here is how to play! First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to move east. That done, make an attempt to move south. After that, head south. And then, recover the sponge from the floor of the sauna. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Laundromat =-
You arrive in a laundromat. An ordinary one.

You smell an intriguing smell, and follow it to a board. Now why would someone leave that there? The board is ordinary. But there isn't a thing on it.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Studio =-
You've just sauntered into a studio. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an unblocked exit to the south. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

There is a loaf of bread on the floor.

-= Dish-Pit =-
You find yourself in a dish-pit. A normal one. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a case. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You see an opened chest nearby. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this?

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

You're now in the workshop. You begin looking for stuff.

Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a mantelpiece. However, the mantelpiece, like an empty mantelpiece, has nothing on it. You can see a table. But there isn't a thing on it.

There is an unguarded exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.
