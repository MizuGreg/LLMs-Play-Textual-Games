Welcome to another profound session of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First step, make an attempt to go east. Then, attempt to venture east. And then, go east. Then, make an effort to travel south. Then, go to the west. With that accomplished, travel west. And then, head west. Following that, attempt to take a trip south. And then, pick up the spork from the floor of the cookery. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is in a text adventure game, and they've been moving between rooms: Laundry Place, Playroom, Cookhouse, and back again. The original goal mentioned in the welcome message was to pick up the spork from the cookery. 

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Playroom again after moving east and west multiple times. The Laundry Place has an exit to the east, which leads back to the Playroom. The Cookhouse was earlier in the journey, but the user hasn't been there in a while. The goal is to pick up the spork, which is in the cookery. 

Wait, the user hasn't gone south yet. The Playroom has an open gate leading south. Maybe that's the way to the Cookhouse again. The original path was: go east, then east again, then go south to the Cookhouse, pick up the spork. But the user has been looping between Playroom and Laundry Place. 

So the next step should be to go south from the Playroom to reach the Cookhouse again, then pick up the spork. The user's current position is the Playroom, so the correct action is to go south. But the user's previous actions were going east and west, which might be redundant. The key is to find the spork, which is in the Cookhouse. So the next move should be south to get back to the Cookhouse and pick up the spork.

You are in a cubicle. A normal kind of place.

You can make out a coffer. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. What's that over there? It looks like it's a desk. The desk is normal. However, the desk, like an empty desk, has nothing on it.

There is an open gate leading north. There is an open portal leading west. There is an unguarded exit to the east. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

It is! It's an armchair. The armchair is normal. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

You can make out a coffer. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. What's that over there? It looks like it's a desk. The desk is normal. However, the desk, like an empty desk, has nothing on it.

There is an open gate leading north. There is an open portal leading west. There is an unguarded exit to the east. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is in a text adventure game, and they've been moving between rooms: Laundry Place, Playroom, Cookhouse, and now they've ended up in the Workshop and Cubicle multiple times. The original goal was to pick up the spork from the cookery.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Cubicle again, and the previous attempts to go south led them back to the Workshop, which has a locked bureau. The user hasn't found the spork yet. The key might be in the Cookhouse, which was part of the initial path. But the user has been looping between Cubicle, Workshop, and Study without reaching the Cookhouse again.

The user needs to find the spork, which is in the Cookhouse. The initial path was to go east, then east again, then south to the Cookhouse. But the user's movements have taken them away from that path. Maybe they need to find another way back to the Cookhouse. The Playroom has an exit to the south, which might lead back to the Cookhouse. Alternatively, the Study has an exit to the south that could lead to the Cookhouse.

Wait, in the Playroom, there's an open gate leading south. The user was in the Playroom earlier and tried going south, but maybe they didn't go that way. The user needs to go south from the Playroom to reach the Cookhouse again. But the user is currently in the Cubicle, so they need to find a path back to the Playroom or Cookhouse.

The Cubicle has an open gate north and a portal west. Going west from the Cubicle leads to the Study, which has an exit to the south. From the Study, going south might lead back to the Playroom. Then from the Playroom, going south would reach the Cookhouse. Once there, the user can pick up the spork.

So the next steps should be: from Cubicle, go west to Study, then south to Playroom, then south again to Cookhouse. But the user is currently in the Cubicle, so the immediate next action is to go west to the Study. Then from Study, go south to Playroom, then south to Cookhouse. Once in the Cookhouse, they can pick up the spork.

But the user's last action was going north from Workshop to Cubicle. Now, in Cubicle, the user should go west to Study. Then from Study, go south to Playroom. Then from Playroom, go south to Cookhouse. Then pick up the spork. So the next command should be go west from Cubicle to Study.

-= Study =-
You're now in the study.

You make out a closed toolbox in the corner. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a locker. You see a mantle. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's an armchair. The armchair is normal. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open portal leading east. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

-= Cookery =-
You find yourself in a cookery. A typical kind of place.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked.

There is a spork on the floor.
