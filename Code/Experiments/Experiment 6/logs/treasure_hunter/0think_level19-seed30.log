Welcome to TextWorld! First of all, you could, like, open the gate. Then, make an attempt to go to the west. And then, travel north. Then, make it so that the hatch is opened. After opening the hatch, take a trip west. Then, make it so that the portal in the bedchamber is ajar. Then, make an attempt to move west. And then, make an effort to go to the south. That done, recover the latchkey from the floor of the closet. Alright, thanks!
