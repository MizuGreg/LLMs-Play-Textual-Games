Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, you could, like, attempt to travel south. And then, make an effort to take a trip east. And then, make an attempt to move east. Following that, open the oak door in the closet. Then, make an effort to go to the north. And then, make an effort to move west. After that, lift the fresh laundry scented key from the floor of the shower. With the fresh laundry scented key, insert the fresh laundry scented key into the fresh laundry scented door in the shower's lock to unlock it. And then, ensure that the fresh laundry scented door inside the shower is open. After that, travel north. Then, attempt to move east. After that, open the portal. Then, attempt to head north. Then, pick-up the latchkey from the floor of the cubicle. Got that? Good!

-= Laundromat =-
You arrive in a laundromat. An ordinary one. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You can see a rack. The rack is normal. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a counter. You shudder, but continue examining the counter. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is an unblocked exit to the south.

You are in a sauna. An ordinary one. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a board. The board is usual. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

There is an open door leading east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in this TextWorld game. They started by going south, then north, then east. But when they tried to go east again, it didn't work. The current location is the Laundromat again, and they can't go east.

Hmm, the original instructions mentioned moving east after going south, then east again, then opening the oak door in the closet. But maybe the path is blocked or requires another action. Since they can't go east from the Laundromat, perhaps they need to check other directions or look for items that might help.

Wait, the user mentioned opening the oak door in the closet. Maybe there's a closet in the Laundromat that they haven't checked. Alternatively, maybe the exit to the east is blocked by something, and they need to interact with an object first. The rack and counter are empty, so maybe there's a hidden item or a puzzle here.

The user is at the Laundromat again after trying to go east. Since going east isn't possible, maybe they should look for other actions like checking the closet, looking for a key, or interacting with the rack or counter. The next step might be to check the closet for the oak door. Alternatively, maybe they need to find a way to open the door first.

But the user's next action should be based on the available commands. Since they can't go east, perhaps they should try another direction, like north again, or check the closet. The original plan was to go south, then east, then east again, but that's not working. Maybe the order of actions needs adjustment. Alternatively, maybe the oak door is in the closet, so they need to open it. But how?

Wait, the user's initial steps were to go south, then north, then east. But after going north, they ended up back in the Laundromat. Maybe the exit to the east is blocked, so they need to find another way. Perhaps the closet is in the Laundromat, and they need to open the oak door there. The user's next action should be to check the closet or look for the oak door. But the game's current state shows the Laundromat with a rack and counter, and an exit to the south. So maybe the closet is part of the room, and they need to open the door there.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to pick up an item first. The original plan included lifting the laundry key from the shower, but that's in the shower, which they haven't accessed yet. But the current location is the Laundromat. So perhaps the next step is to check the closet for the oak door. The user's next action should be to open the oak door in the closet. But how? Maybe they need to look for the closet first.

Wait, the user's initial instructions said to open the oak door in the closet. So maybe the closet is in the Laundromat. The user needs to look for a closet in the room. Since the rack and counter are there, maybe the closet is nearby. So the next action would be to look for the closet and open the oak door. But the game's current state doesn't mention a closet. Maybe the user needs to check the room again for objects.

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go east again, but it's blocked. So perhaps they need to find another way. But the user can't go east, so maybe they need to try another direction. The only exit is south. But that's where they came from. Maybe they need to find another item or interact with the rack or counter. But the rack is empty, and the counter is empty. So perhaps the next step is to check the closet, even if it's not mentioned. Maybe the user should try to open the oak door in the closet, even if it's not immediately visible.

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go east again, but the game is blocking it. So perhaps the user needs to find a way to proceed. But the user's next action should be based on the available commands. Since they can't go east, maybe they should try another direction, like north again, but that's where they came from. Alternatively, check the closet for the oak door.

In the original plan, after going south, then north, then east, then open the oak door. But since they can't go east, maybe the next step is to check the closet for the oak door. So the next action would be to open the oak door in the closet. But how? Maybe the user needs to look for the closet first. So the next action is to look around for the closet, then open the door. But the game's current state doesn't mention a closet. So perhaps the user needs to check the room again for objects. Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go east again, but the game is blocking it, so they need to find another way.

Wait, the user's initial steps were to go south, then north, then east. But after going north, they are back in the Laundromat. Then they tried to go east, but it's blocked. So maybe the next step is to check the closet in the Laundromat. The user's next action should be to open the oak door in the closet. But how? Maybe the user needs to look for the closet first. So the next action is to look around for the closet. But the game's current state doesn't mention it. Maybe the user needs to check the rack or counter for something. But they are empty. Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go east again, but it's not possible. So perhaps the user is stuck and needs to find another way.

In this case, the user's next action should be to check the closet for the oak door. So the command would be to open the oak door in the closet. But the game might not have that object yet. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to look for the closet first. But since the game's current state doesn't mention it, perhaps the user needs to try another approach. However, the user's instructions say to open the oak door in the closet. So the next action is to open that door. But how? Maybe the user needs to look for the closet first. But since the game doesn't mention it, maybe the user is supposed to proceed with the next step in the original plan, even if it's blocked. Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go east again, but it's not possible. So the user might need to find another way.

In conclusion, the next action should be to open the oak door in the closet, even if it's not immediately visible. So the command is "open oak door in closet".

Okay, let's recap what's happening here. The user is in a laundromat, and they've been trying to find the oak door in the closet as per the original instructions. But so far, they've been unable to locate it. The game's current state shows a rack, a counter, and an exit to the south. The user has tried multiple commands like looking around, checking the rack, counter, and the south exit, but nothing seems to work.

The original plan was to go south, then north, then east, open the oak door in the closet, then proceed to north again, move west, pick up the key from the shower, unlock the door, and so on. But the user is stuck in the laundromat, unable to find the closet or the oak door. The problem might be that the closet isn't in the laundromat, or maybe the oak door is in a different location that's not immediately visible.

Since the user has tried looking around and specific objects without success, maybe the next step is to try a different approach. The user might need to check other directions or look for clues that indicate where the closet is. However, the only exit available is to the south, which they've already tried. Alternatively, maybe the closet is part of the laundromat, but it's hidden or requires a specific action to open.

Another possibility is that the user needs to find a key or item that allows them to open the door. The original plan mentioned picking up the laundry key from the shower, but the user hasn't reached the shower yet. However, the current location is the laundromat, so maybe the shower is in a different part of the game.

Given the constraints, the user might need to try moving south again, even though that's the only exit. But the user is already in the laundromat, and moving south would take them back to the sauna. Alternatively, maybe the closet is in the sauna, and the user needs to check there. But the user's last action was in the laundromat.

Wait, the user's initial steps were to go south, then north, which brought them back to the laundromat. The next step was to go east, but that's blocked. So perhaps the user needs to find another way to proceed. Since the oak door is in the closet, and the user can't find it, maybe the closet is in the laundromat but requires an action to open. However, the user hasn't found it yet.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to look for the key first. The original plan says to pick up the key from the shower, but the user hasn't accessed the shower. However, the current location is the laundromat, so maybe the shower is in a different room. But the user can't go east, so they might be stuck.

In this case, the user's next action should be to try moving south again, even though they've been there before. Maybe there's a hidden path or an object in the sauna that can help. Alternatively, the user might need to look for the key in the laundromat, but the rack and counter are empty. 

Given the available commands and the current state, the user might need to try looking around again or check the south exit for something. But the user has already tried that. The next logical step might be to go south again, even though it's the same room, to see if there's anything new. Alternatively, the user might need to look for the key in the laundromat, but it's not there. 

So, the next action should be to go south again, even though it's the same room, to check if there's something else there. But the user is already in the laundromat, and moving south would take them to the sauna. Maybe the sauna has the key or the closet. So the user should try moving south again.

-= Sauna =-
You are in a sauna. An ordinary one. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a board. The board is usual. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

There is an open door leading east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.

<think>
Okay, the user is stuck in the Laundromat again, trying to find the oak door in the closet. They've tried multiple commands like looking around, examining the rack and counter, and checking the south exit, but nothing seems to work. The original plan was to go south, then north, then east, but that's not working. The user is now in the Laundromat again after going south and north.

The problem might be that the closet isn't in the Laundromat. Maybe the closet is in the sauna or another room. The user tried going east from the Laundromat but couldn't. The sauna has an east door, but the user hasn't checked that yet. Maybe the closet is in the sauna, and the user needs to check there.

Alternatively, the user might need to find the key first. The original plan mentions picking up the laundry key from the shower, but the user hasn't reached the shower. However, the current location is the Laundromat, so maybe the shower is in a different part of the game. The user needs to find a way to get to the shower or the closet.

Since the user can't go east from the Laundromat, maybe they need to check the sauna's east door. The sauna has an open door leading east. The user hasn't checked that yet. Maybe the closet is in the sauna, and the user needs to go east from the sauna. But the user is in the Laundromat, so they need to go south to the sauna, then east. Let me check the previous steps.

The user went south to the sauna, then north back to the Laundromat. Now, they need to go south again to the sauna, then east. The sauna's east door might lead to the closet. So the next action should be to go south again, then east. But the user is currently in the Laundromat, so they need to go south to the sauna first. Then, from the sauna, go east. That might lead them to the closet where the oak door is. So the next command should be "go south" again to reach the sauna, then "go east" from there. But the user is in the Laundromat, so the next step is to go south again.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Laundromat and the Sauna, trying to find the oak door in the closet. They've tried multiple commands but haven't found the closet or the door. The original plan was to go south, then north, then east, but that's not working. The user is now in the Sauna again after going south and north.

However, the current location is the Sauna, so maybe the shower is in the Cookhouse or another room. The user needs to check the Cookhouse's east or west doors.

Since the user is in the Sauna, they can try going east again to the Cookhouse. The Cookhouse has an open wooden gateway leading east and a door leading west. Maybe the closet is in the Cookhouse, and the user needs to go east from there. The next step should be to go east from the Cookhouse to check for the closet or the key.

Okay, the user is trying to open the oak door in the closet, but the game is not responding correctly. They've tried "open oak door north" multiple times, but the system keeps saying it only understood the part about opening the oak door. Maybe the correct command is just "open oak door" without specifying north. Let me check the previous messages.

In the Closet room, there's a closed oak door leading north and an open wooden gateway west. The user tried "open oak door north" but the game didn't recognize it. Maybe the door's name is just "oak door" and not "oak door north". So the correct command should be "open oak door". Let me try that.

Okay, the user is trying to take the "fresh laundry scented key from the floor" in the Shower room. But the game keeps saying "You can't see any such thing." Wait, earlier in the Shower description, it mentions "There is a fresh laundry scented key on the floor." So why can't the user see it?

Maybe the command is incorrect. The correct command should be "take fresh laundry scented key" without specifying "from floor" since the key is already on the floor. Alternatively, maybe the key is hidden or needs to be interacted with differently. Let me check the previous commands.

The user tried "take fresh laundry scented key from floor" multiple times, but the game doesn't recognize it. The correct command might just be "take fresh laundry scented key" because the key is on the floor by default. The game might not require the "from floor" part if the key is already there. So the next action should be to take the key directly.

Okay, the user is trying to unlock the fresh laundry scented door north using the key they picked up. The game keeps saying "I didn't understand that sentence." Maybe the command format is wrong. Let me check the available commands again.

The available commands include "unlock ... with ...". The correct syntax should be "unlock fresh laundry scented door north with fresh laundry scented key". But the game might be expecting a different structure, like "unlock door north with key". Alternatively, maybe the door's name is different. Let me check the previous messages.

In the Shower room, the door is described as "closed fresh laundry scented door leading north". So the correct command should be "unlock fresh laundry scented door north with fresh laundry scented key". But the game isn't recognizing it. Maybe the key's name is just "fresh laundry scented key" without repeating it. Let me try simplifying the command.
