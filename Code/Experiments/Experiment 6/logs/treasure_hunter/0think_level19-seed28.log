Welcome to TextWorld! First of all, go to the south. Next, make an attempt to move west. And then, try to travel north. Then, ensure that the portal within the laundromat is open. And then, attempt to venture north. And then, move west. Following that, make an effort to take a trip south. Then, venture west. Next, pick up the passkey from the floor of the basement. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.
