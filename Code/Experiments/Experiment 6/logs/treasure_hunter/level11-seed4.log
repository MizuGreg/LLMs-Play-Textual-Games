Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First off, make an attempt to move south. And then, pick up the napkin from the floor of the scullery. That's it!

-= Canteen =-
You are in a canteen. A standard kind of place.



There is an open portal leading north. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

>                                                                                                                                -= Canteen =-0/1

go south

-= Scullery =-
You arrive in a scullery. A standard one.

You make out a closed refrigerator here.

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

There is a napkin on the floor.


>                                                                                                                                -= Scullery =-0/2
Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Scullery now. The goal was to pick up the napkin from the floor of the scullery. The user just moved south from the Canteen to the Scullery. The current description mentions a napkin on the floor. So the next logical step is to pick up the napkin. The command should be "pick up napkin". Let me check if there are any other items or obstacles. The refrigerator is closed, but that's not relevant here. The exit to the north is unblocked, but the main task is to pick up the napkin. So the correct action is to pick up the napkin.
</think>pick up napkin
