Welcome to another life changing session of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First step, ensure that the door is open. And then, make an effort to travel south. With that over with, pick up the candy bar from the board. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Chamber =-
Ah, the chamber. This is some kind of chamber, really great typical vibes in this place, a wonderful typical atmosphere. And now, well, you're in it.

You can make out a locked box.

There is a closed door leading south. There is an open gateway leading west.

-= Kitchen =-
You make a grand eccentric entrance into a kitchen.

You can make out a board. On the board you can see a candy bar.

There is an open door leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.
