Welcome to another fast paced episode of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, make an attempt to go to the south. With that accomplished, venture west. That done, ensure that the gateway in the basement is open. And then, go west. Next, lift the latchkey from the floor of the bedroom. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Steam Room =-
Look at that notice! What does it say? It says Welcome to the steam room? Well that's cool.

If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a cabinet. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You make out a shelf! The shelf is typical. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open gate leading north. There is an open hatch leading south.
