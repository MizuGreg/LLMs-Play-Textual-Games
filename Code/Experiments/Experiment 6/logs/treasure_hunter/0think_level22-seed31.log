Well, here we are in the playroom.

A locked chest is nearby. You make out a bed. The bed is normal. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset.

There is an open portal leading east. There is an open gateway leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Garage =-
You've entered a garage. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

-= Bedroom =-
You've entered a bedroom. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a basket. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting.

There is an open portal leading west. There is an unguarded exit to the east. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.
