Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an fast paced round of TextWorld? You do! Your first objective is to try to go west. And then, pick up the latchkey from the floor of the studio. Alright, thanks!

-= Steam Room =-
You find yourself in a steam room. A typical one.

You can make out a box, so there's that. You make out a rack. The rack is typical. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can see a table. The table is normal. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

-= Studio =-
You've just shown up in a studio. You can barely contain your excitement.

Oh, great. Here's a stand. The stand appears to be empty.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

There is a latchkey on the floor.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and collect items. The current room is the Studio, and there's a latchkey on the floor. The user's previous action was going west, which took them from the Steam Room to the Studio.

The user is now asking if they're making the right actions and if they're close to the goal. The goal is to pick up the latchkey and probably exit the studio. Since the latchkey is on the floor in the Studio, the next logical step is to pick it up. The user hasn't done that yet. The available exits are east, north, or possibly west again. But since the latchkey is in the Studio, the immediate action should be to pick it up. The user's next command should be to pick up the latchkey. However, in TextWorld-style games, the command might be "take latchkey" or "get latchkey". But the user's previous action was "go west", so maybe the game expects "take" as the command. Let me check the previous messages. The user was told to "pick up the latchkey from the floor of the studio." So the correct command here would be "take latchkey" or "get latchkey". But the user's previous action was "go west", so the next step is to pick up the key. The user is in the Studio, and the key is on the floor. So the next action should be to pick it up. The answer should be "take latchkey".
