Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! First, it would be fantastic if you could travel south. After that, make an attempt to take a trip south. Okay, and then, head east. And then, attempt to venture east. That done, make an attempt to go east. After that, recover the burger from the floor of the study. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Salon =-
You've just shown up in a salon.

You scan the room, seeing a recliner. The recliner is typical. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

-= Steam Room =-
You've entered a steam room. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You can see a locked drawer. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a shelf. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You see a counter. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. This always happens, here in TextWorld!

There is an open gate leading east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Of every laundry place you could have walked into, you had to come round an ordinary one.

Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a bench. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

There is an open door leading north. There is an open portal leading west.

You see an armchair. The armchair is standard. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You swear loudly. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a mantle. The mantle is normal. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

You find yourself in a studio. A typical one. The room is well lit.

You see an armchair. The armchair is standard. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You swear loudly. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a mantle. The mantle is normal. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.
