Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First stop, make an effort to venture south. Next, make an effort to move east. And then, travel north. And then, make an attempt to travel east. With that over with, head north. With that accomplished, go to the west. Then, make an effort to take a trip north. Then, retrieve the Cat Calendar from the floor of the cubicle. Once that's all handled, you can stop!
