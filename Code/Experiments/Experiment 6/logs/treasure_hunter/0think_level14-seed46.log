Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is how to play! First thing I need you to do is to go south. Following that, go to the east. And then, attempt to venture south. Then, make an attempt to move west. Okay, and then, pick up the key from the floor of the chamber. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Garage =-
You arrive in a garage. An ordinary kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You make out a closed display.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

There is a latchkey on the floor.

-= Shower =-
You find yourself in a shower. An ordinary kind of place. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You can make out a bench. The bench is ordinary. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the north.

-= Spare Room =-
You're now in a spare room. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

You can make out a coffer. Classic TextWorld. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You can see a chest. Now why would someone leave that there? You scan the room for a suitcase, and you find a suitcase. You smell a lovely smell, and follow it to a workbench. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an unblocked exit to the south. There is an unguarded exit to the west.
