Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, try to go south. Okay, and then, recover the keycard from the floor of the laundry place. Alright, thanks!

-= Cubicle =-
You arrive in a cubicle. A typical kind of place.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

go south

-= Laundry Place =-
You are in a laundry place.



There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

There is a keycard on the floor.
