I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Your first objective is to make an attempt to go south. After that, attempt to head south. And then, doublecheck that the hatch is ajar. After that, try to venture east. If you can get through with that, go east. Following that, ensure that the door is open. After that, make an effort to move south. After that, take the candy bar from the board within the kitchen. And once you've done that, you win!
