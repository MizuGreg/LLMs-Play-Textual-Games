Welcome to another life changing session of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to try to take a trip west. After that, make an attempt to travel west. With that over with, head north. With that accomplished, go to the east. Then, make an effort to take a trip east. Then, attempt to go north. With that done, go to the west. After that, try to go to the north. Once you finish that, retrieve the Cat Calendar from the floor of the cubicle. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Shower =-
You're now in a shower.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

-= Cookery =-
You've just walked into a cookery. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You see a fridge. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a freezer.

You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.
