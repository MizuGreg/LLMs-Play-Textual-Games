Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an exciting round of TextWorld? You do! First, it would be fantastic if you could ensure that the passageway is open. Then, travel east. After that, recover the nest of earwigs from the floor of the attic. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Cubicle =-
You are in a cubicle. A standard one. The room is well lit.

You can see a safe. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You can make out a table. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is a closed passageway leading east. There is an open portal leading north. There is an open hatch leading west. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they need to open a passageway, go east, recover earwigs from the attic, and then stop. The current location is a cubicle with a closed passageway east, an open portal north, open hatch west, and exit south.

The user tried "go east" but was told they need to open the passageway first. So the next step is to figure out how to open it. The passageway is closed, so maybe there's a way to open it. The cubicle has a safe, a table (which is empty), and the passageway east is closed. The user might need to interact with the safe or something else to open the passageway.

Looking at the items in the room: the safe is there. Maybe the safe is the key to opening the passageway. The user could try opening the safe. If the safe is locked, they might need a key, but since it's a text game, maybe there's a way to open it without a key. Alternatively, maybe the passageway can be opened by using the safe. Or perhaps the table has something, but it's empty. The user might need to check the safe first.

So the next action should be to open the safe. That makes sense because the safe is the only object that could be related to the passageway. So the command would be "open safe".

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this TextWorld game. The original goal was to ensure the passageway is open, travel east, recover the earwigs from the attic, and then stop. 

First, they started in the cubicle. The initial action was "go east", but the game said the passageway had to be opened first. So the user tried to open the safe next. The safe was opened, but that might not be the right path.

Wait, the original task was to open the passageway east. The user tried to go east first, but it was closed. Then they opened the safe. But opening the safe might not relate to the passageway. Maybe the safe is a red herring. The correct action should be to open the passageway, but how? The game didn't mention a way to open it yet. Maybe there's a key or something else. But the user hasn't found that yet. 

Alternatively, maybe the safe contains something needed to open the passageway. But in the current state, after opening the safe, the next step should be to check if the passageway is now open. But the game's response after opening the safe didn't indicate any change. So perhaps the user is on the wrong track. 

The original goal was to open the passageway, then go east. So the correct next step should be to find a way to open the passageway. Maybe the safe is a distraction. The user might need to look for a key or another object. But in the current description, the cubicle has a safe, a table, and the passageway is closed. The user might need to find a way to open the passageway, perhaps by using the safe's contents. But since the safe was opened and nothing was found, maybe the next step is to check the other directions, like north or west, but the original plan was to go east after opening the passageway. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to open the passageway first, but the game hasn't provided a way to do that yet. The user might need to find a key or use an item from the safe. Since the safe was opened, maybe there's a key inside. But the game's response didn't mention any items. So the user might be stuck. 

But the user's next action after opening the safe was to go east, but the passageway is still closed. So maybe the correct action is to look for a key or another object that can open the passageway. However, the user hasn't found that yet. 

In the current state, the user has opened the safe, but the passageway is still closed. The next logical step would be to check the safe's contents to see if there's a key or something that can open the passageway. But since the game didn't mention any items, maybe the user is supposed to try another approach. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go north through the portal, but that's not part of the original plan. The original plan was to open the passageway east, then go east. So the user needs to focus on opening the passageway. 

But the game's response after opening the safe didn't indicate any progress. So maybe the user needs to look for another way to open the passageway. Perhaps the safe is a trap, and the correct action is to check the other directions. 

In conclusion, the user might be on the wrong path. The correct next action should be to find a way to open the passageway, possibly by checking the safe's contents or another object. But since the safe was opened and nothing was found, maybe the next step is to check the other directions, like north or west, but that's not part of the original plan. Alternatively, the user might need to look for a key or another item. However, based on the current information, the next action should be to check the safe again or look for a key. But the user's last action was opening the safe, so maybe the next step is to look for a key inside the safe. But the game didn't mention any items, so perhaps the user is supposed to try another approach. 

Wait, the original instruction said to ensure the passageway is open first. The user tried to go east but it was closed. Then they opened the safe. Maybe the safe's contents are a key. But the game didn't mention any items. So maybe the user is supposed to try to open the passageway again, but how? Maybe the correct action is to look for a key in the safe. But since the safe was opened, maybe the user needs to check the contents. However, the game's response after opening the safe didn't mention any items. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go north through the portal, but that's not part of the original plan. The original plan was to open the passageway east, then go east.

But the user is in the cubicle, and the passageway is closed. The next step should be to find a way to open it. Maybe the safe is the key. So the user should check the safe's contents. But since the safe was opened, maybe the user needs to look inside. However, the game didn't mention any items. 

In this case, the user might need to try another action. Maybe the correct next step is to check the safe again, but the user already did that. Alternatively, the user might need to look for a key in another place. But the game's description doesn't mention any other items. 

So, based on the current information, the user might be on the wrong path. The correct action should be to find a way to open the passageway, but the user hasn't found it yet. Therefore, the next action should be to look for a key or another item that can open the passageway. But since the safe was opened and nothing was found, maybe the user needs to check the other directions. 

Alternatively, the user might need to go north through the portal, but that's not part of the original plan. The original plan was to go east after opening the passageway. So the user should focus on opening the passageway.

In summary, the user is stuck because they tried to open the safe but didn't find anything. The correct next action is to find a way to open the passageway, but the user hasn't found it yet. Therefore, the user should check the safe again for any items that can open the passageway. But since the game didn't mention any items, the user might need to try another approach.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this TextWorld game. The original goal was to ensure the passageway is open, travel east, recover the earwigs from the attic, and then stop. So far, they've been told to open the passageway first, then go east. They tried opening the safe, but that might not be relevant. Then they opened the passageway, which was the correct step.

Now, the next step after opening the passageway should be to go east, as the initial instruction said. The user's last action was opening the passageway, so the next logical command is "go east". They need to move into the east passage to proceed. The game might have a check for that action. I need to make sure that's the correct next step. The user might be confused if they try something else, but according to the original plan, after opening the passageway, going east is the next thing. So the answer should be "go east".

You've stumbled into an usual room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be usual. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the attic.

You make out a workbench. The workbench is typical. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is an open passageway leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

There is a nest of earwigs on the floor.

Okay, let me think through this. The user is playing a text adventure game. The original goal was to ensure the passageway is open, travel east, recover the earwigs from the attic, and then stop.

So far, they've opened the passageway, gone east to the attic, and now they're in the attic. The nest of earwigs is on the floor here. The next step should be to recover the nest. But how? The user needs to pick it up or maybe just collect it. The command might be "take nest of earwigs" or "get nest of earwigs". Since the game is text-based, the correct action would be to take it. The user is in the attic, so the command should be to take the nest. Let me check the previous actions. The user was told there's a nest on the floor, so the next logical step is to take it. Therefore, the correct command is "take nest of earwigs".
