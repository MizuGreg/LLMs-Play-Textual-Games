-= Workshop =-
Guess what, you are in the place we're calling the workshop.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

-= Bathroom =-
Ah, the bathroom. This is some kind of bathroom, really great normal vibes in this place, a wonderful normal atmosphere. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You see an opened safe here. The safe is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever!

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

-= Shower =-
You are in a shower. An ordinary one.

You can see a board. However, the board, like an empty board, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You can see a table. The table is typical. But there isn't a thing on it.

There is an unguarded exit to the east. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

You're now in the bedroom. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You can make out a bed. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The bed is usual. However, the bed, like an empty bed, has nothing on it. What's the point of an empty bed?

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.
