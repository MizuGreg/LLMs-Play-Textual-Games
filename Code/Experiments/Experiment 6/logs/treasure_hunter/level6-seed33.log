Welcome to another life changing round of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First thing I need you to do is to try to venture east. With that accomplished, attempt to take a trip north. And then, lift the coconut from the floor of the cubicle. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Playroom =-
You find yourself in a playroom. A typical one. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.



There is an unguarded exit to the east.

>                                                                                                                                -= Playroom =-0/1
AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go east
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Kitchen =-
You've entered a kitchen. The room is well lit.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go north
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Cubicle =-
You are in a cubicle. A standard kind of place. The room is well lit.



There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

There is a coconut on the floor.
