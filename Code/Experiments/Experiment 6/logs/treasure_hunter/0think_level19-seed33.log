It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First stop, make an attempt to go to the east. With that done, head east. And then, head south. If you can accomplish that, make an effort to take a trip south. Then, make an effort to move west. If you can finish that, attempt to go north. And then, venture west. And then, try to take a trip south. Then, pick up the loaf of bread from the floor of the salon. Got that? Good!
