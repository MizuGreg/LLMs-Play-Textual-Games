It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to make an effort to move south. Then, open the gateway. Then, attempt to travel south. Then, attempt to travel west. After that, take a trip south. And then, recover the key from the rack. Alright, thanks!
