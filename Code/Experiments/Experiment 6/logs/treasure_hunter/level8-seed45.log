Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First thing I need you to do is to make an effort to go to the east. And then, travel north. Then, take a trip west. And then, pick-up the pizza from the floor of the sauna. That's it!

-= Studio =-
You've just shown up in a studio. You start to take note of what's in the room.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east.

>                                                                                                                                -= Studio =-0/1
AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go east
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Pantry =-
This is going to sound unbelievable, but you've just entered a pantry.



There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.



>                                                                                                                                -= Pantry =-0/2
AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go north
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Attic =-
You are in an attic. A standard kind of place.



There is an unguarded exit to the north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.



>                                                                                                                                -= Attic =-0/3
AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go west

-= Sauna =-
Guess what, you are in a place we're calling a sauna.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east.

There is a pizza and a carrot on the floor.


>                                                                                                                                -= Sauna =-0/4
