Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is how to play! First thing I need you to do is to travel west. And then, make sure that the door is ajar. And then, make an effort to take a trip south. Okay, and then, venture west. After that, make an attempt to head west. And then, travel south. And then, make an effort to go east. After that, travel east. Okay, and then, go to the east. Next, retrieve the burger from the floor of the study. That's it!

-= Studio =-
You find yourself in a studio. A typical one. The room is well lit.

You see an armchair. The armchair is standard. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You swear loudly. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a mantle. The mantle is normal. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

You find yourself in a studio. A typical one. The room is well lit.

You see an armchair. The armchair is standard. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You swear loudly. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a mantle. The mantle is normal. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.
