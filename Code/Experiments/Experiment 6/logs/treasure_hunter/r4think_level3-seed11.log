It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First off, travel south. Then, pick up the laptop from the floor of the studio. Alright, thanks!

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

You find yourself in a studio. An usual one.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

There is a laptop on the floor.
