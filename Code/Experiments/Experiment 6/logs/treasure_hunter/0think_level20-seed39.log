I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is how to play! First thing I need you to do is to make an attempt to go north. Once you get through with that, make an attempt to venture north. And then, open the gateway within the kitchenette. And then, make an effort to take a trip east. Once you do that, recover the burger from the floor of the cubicle. Got that? Good!

-= Studio =-
Well, here we are in a studio.

You can see an opened box nearby. The box is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever!

You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked.

There is a keycard on the floor.

-= Bedchamber =-
You arrive in a bedchamber. A normal kind of place. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.



There is a closed door leading west. There is an open passageway leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.
