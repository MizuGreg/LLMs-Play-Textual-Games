I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! First thing I need you to do is to make an effort to go east. With that accomplished, travel east. After that, recover the burger from the floor of the study. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Restroom =-
You arrive in a restroom. An usual one. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.



There is an open gateway leading east. There is an open hatch leading north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.
