Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to make an attempt to go west. Then, try to travel north. After that, go east. Then, venture north. Following that, pick up the passkey from the floor of the cookhouse. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Laundry Place =-
You arrive in a laundry place. A normal one. You begin to take stock of what's here.



You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Cubicle =-
I am sorry to announce that you are now in the cubicle.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north.

There is a key on the floor.

-= Basement =-
You find yourself in a basement. An ordinary kind of place. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what to do next. The user mentioned a few steps: go west, then north, then east, then north again, and pick up the passkey from the cookhouse. 

Starting from the Laundry Place, the first action was go west to the Cubicle. Then, going north took me to the Basement. Now, the current location is the Basement. The user's next step should be to go east, as per the initial instructions. But wait, the Basement has an exit to the east and south. The user's goal is to get the passkey from the cookhouse. 

But where is the cookhouse? The user mentioned the cookhouse's passkey is on the floor. So maybe the cookhouse is in the basement? Or perhaps after moving east from the basement, there's a path to the cookhouse. 

In the Basement, the exits are east and south. The user's next action should be to go east. Let me check the previous steps again. The user said after going west, then north, then east, then north. So after the Basement, the next step is east, then north. 

So, from the Basement, going east would be the next step. Then, from there, go north to reach the cookhouse. But I need to confirm if the cookhouse is in the next room. Alternatively, maybe the cookhouse is in the basement. But the user said the passkey is on the floor of the cookhouse. So perhaps the cookhouse is a different room. 

Wait, the user's initial instructions said to pick up the passkey from the floor of the cookhouse. So the cookhouse must be a separate location. So after the Basement, going east would lead to another area. Let me think: the user is in the Basement. The exit to the east is unguarded. So going east from the Basement would be the next step. Then, perhaps the cookhouse is in that next room. 

So the next action is go east. Then, after that, go north to reach the cookhouse. Then pick up the passkey. 

But the user's current location is the Basement. The next step is to go east. So the answer should be "go east".
</think>go east

-= Garage =-
You have stumbled into the most usual of all possible garages. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.



There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an unblocked exit to the west.
