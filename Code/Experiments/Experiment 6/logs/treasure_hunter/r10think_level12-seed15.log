Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First thing I need you to do is to make an effort to travel south. If you can do that, attempt to go east. Then, retrieve the sandwich from the floor of the shower. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Lounge =-
Fancy seeing you here. Here, by the way, being the lounge. Let's see what's in here.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a bar. The bar is ordinary. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a couch. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The couch is typical. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You think about smashing the couch to bits, throwing the bits in the dump, etc, until you get bored. Look over there! a desk! Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is an unguarded exit to the east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

-= Workshop =-
Ah, the workshop. This is some kind of workshop, really great standard vibes in this place, a wonderful standard atmosphere. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

You can see an opened safe. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You make out a stand. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms. The task is to first travel south, then east, retrieve a sandwich from the shower floor, and then stop.

Looking at the history, the user has been moving between the Lounge and Workshop. They tried going south and north repeatedly. The current location is the Lounge again, with the same description. The exit to the east is unguarded, and the user is advised to try north or south again.

But the user's latest prompt asks if they're making the right actions and if they're close to the goal. The assistant needs to decide the next move. The original task was to go south, then east, then get the sandwich. However, in the current setup, the Lounge and Workshop are looping, and there's no mention of a shower yet. Maybe the user hasn't found the shower room yet.

Wait, the initial instruction said to "retrieve the sandwich from the floor of the shower." So the user needs to reach a shower room. But in the current rooms (Lounge and Workshop), there's no mention of a shower. Perhaps the shower is in a different area. The user has been moving between Lounge and Workshop, but maybe the east exit leads to another room that's not yet explored.

The user is advised to go east from the Lounge. The previous attempts to go east from Workshop didn't yield anything. But maybe from Lounge, going east is possible. However, in the current description, the Lounge has an exit to the east, and the Workshop has an exit to the east as well. But the user is stuck in a loop between these two rooms.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to find the shower room. Since the task mentions the shower floor, perhaps the shower is in a room that's not yet visited. The user needs to explore east from Lounge to find it. But the current description doesn't mention a shower. Maybe the user hasn't found the correct path yet.

The assistant's next action should be to go east from the Lounge, as per the initial instruction. Even though the user has been looping, the task requires moving east after going south. So the next step is to go east to see if that leads to the shower room where the sandwich is located.

-= Bedchamber =-
You're now in the bedchamber. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?



There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the south. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

You've just sauntered into a shower.



There is an open gateway leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

There is a sandwich on the floor.
