It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! First step, move west. That done, head west. And then, take a trip south. Next, make an effort to move east. Then, take a trip south. Then, go west. That done, lift the key from the floor of the chamber. Got that? Good!

-= Studio =-
Well how about that, you are in a place we're calling a studio.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.
