It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, you could, like, travel west. And then, lift the latchkey from the floor of the workshop. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Spare Room =-
You find yourself in a spare room. An usual kind of place. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.



There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

-= Workshop =-
You've just sauntered into a workshop.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the north.

There is a gummy bear and a latchkey on the floor.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in the Workshop, which is part of the TextWorld game. The goal is to lift the latchkey from the floor of the workshop and then win. So far, they've gone west from the Spare Room into the Workshop. Now, in the Workshop, there's a gummy bear and a latchkey on the floor. The user needs to pick up the latchkey.

The current prompt mentions that the exit to the north is unguarded, but the main task is to lift the latchkey. The user's previous action was "go west", which brought them to the Workshop. Now, they need to interact with the latchkey. Since the latchkey is on the floor, the correct action would be to pick it up. The game might require using the "take" or "pick up" command. But in TextWorld, sometimes the command is just "take latchkey" or "get latchkey". The user needs to do that to collect it. Once the latchkey is lifted, they win. So the next action should be to take the latchkey.
