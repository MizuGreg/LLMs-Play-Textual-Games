I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! First, it would be a great idea if you could make an attempt to take a trip east. Then, make an effort to travel north. That done, move north. Following that, move west. And then, pick-up the stick of butter from the floor of the kitchenette. That's it!

-= Cellar =-
You are in an usual kind of place. That is to say, you're in a cellar. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a rack. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing hasn't got anything on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the rack. You can make out a workbench. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Hm. Oh well

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

-= Office =-
You find yourself in an office. A typical kind of place.

A closed coffer is right there by you.

There is an open door leading east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Pantry =-
You arrive in a pantry. A standard kind of place.

You scan the room for a stand, and you find a stand. The stand is typical. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.

There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is in a text-based game called TextWorld, and they've been moving through different rooms: cellar, office, pantry. The original goal was to pick up the stick of butter from the kitchenette. So far, they've gone east from the cellar to the office, then north to the pantry. Now, the next step is to figure out the correct path to reach the kitchenette where the butter is.

Looking at the current room, the pantry, the description mentions exits to north, south, and west. The user's previous actions were go east (cellar to office), then go north (office to pantry). Now, they need to continue moving towards the kitchenette. The kitchenette is probably in the north or west direction from the pantry. But the pantry's exits are north, south, and west. Let me check the previous rooms again.

In the cellar, the exits were east, north, south. Then the office had exits east, north, west. The pantry has exits north, south, west. The original goal is to get to the kitchenette. The user needs to find the path that leads to the kitchenette. Since the user hasn't found the butter yet, they need to continue moving through the rooms.

In the pantry, the user might need to go north to reach the kitchenette. But the pantry's north exit is unblocked. Alternatively, maybe the kitchenette is in the west direction. But the user's previous steps were moving north, so maybe continuing north from the pantry would lead to the kitchenette. Alternatively, maybe the kitchenette is in the south direction from the pantry, but the user would have to check that.

Wait, the user's original plan was to go east, then north, then north again, then west, and pick up the butter. But in the pantry, the user is currently at the third room. The next step would be to go north from the pantry to reach the kitchenette. Let me check the previous steps again. The user's plan was: go east (cellar to office), then go north (office to pantry), then go north again (pantry to kitchenette?), then west, then pick up the butter. So from the pantry, going north would be the next step. But the pantry's north exit is unblocked. So the user should go north from the pantry to reach the kitchenette. Then, from the kitchenette, go west to find the butter. So the next action is to go north from the pantry.
</think>go north

-= Dish-Pit =-
You've just sauntered into a dish-pit. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

Look over there! a freezer. You shudder, but continue examining the room.

There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.



>                                                                                                                                -= Dish-Pit =-0/4

-= Kitchenette =-
Well, here we are in a kitchenette.

You can make out a locked cabinet close by.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

There is a stick of butter on the floor.


>                                                                                                                                -= Kitchenette =-0/5

<think>
Okay, let me recap the user's journey so far. They started in the cellar, went east to the office, then north to the pantry, then north again to the dish-pit, and finally west to the kitchenette. The goal was to pick up the stick of butter from the kitchenette's floor. The user is now in the kitchenette, and the stick of butter is indeed there. The next logical step is to pick it up. The command should be "take stick of butter" or something similar. But the user's previous actions were all "go" commands. However, in TextWorld, you typically use "take" to pick up items. So the correct action here is to take the stick of butter. The user needs to input that command now.
</think>take stick of butter
