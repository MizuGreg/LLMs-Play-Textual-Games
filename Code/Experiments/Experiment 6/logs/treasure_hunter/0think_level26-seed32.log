Welcome to TextWorld! Here is how to play! First stop, make an effort to venture north. Okay, and then, go west. After that, move south. Next, recover the Microsoft latchkey from the board. If you can get your hands on the Microsoft latchkey, take a trip north. Once you accomplish that, venture east. Once you succeed at that, try to move south. With that over with, insert the Microsoft latchkey into the Microsoft portal in the bedroom's lock to unlock it. After that, ensure that the Microsoft portal inside the bedroom is open. After that, move south. After that, venture south. And then, pick up the passkey from the floor of the kitchen. Alright, thanks!

-= Bedroom =-
Guess what, you are in a place we're calling a bedroom.



There is a closed Microsoft portal leading south. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the north. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

You arrive in a sauna. A standard kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a trunk, so there's that. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a board. The board is typical. The board appears to be empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Sauna =-
You arrive in a sauna. A standard kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a trunk, so there's that. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a board. The board is typical. The board appears to be empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked.
