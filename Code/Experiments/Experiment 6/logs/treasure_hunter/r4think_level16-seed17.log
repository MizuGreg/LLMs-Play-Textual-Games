Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an profound round of TextWorld? You do! Here is your task for today. First of all, move west. After that, open the portal. Then, make an attempt to move north. Next, ensure that the door is open. And then, make an attempt to head north. And then, pick-up the potato from the floor of the salon. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Kitchen =-
If you're wondering why everything seems so typical all of a sudden, it's because you've just shown up in the kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.



There is an open gateway leading east. There is an open hatch leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps in the text adventure game. They started in the kitchen, moved west to the office, opened the portal, went north to the attic, opened the door there. Now they're at the attic with a chest and a closed cabinet. The next steps according to the original task were: after opening the door, try to go north again, then pick up the potato from the salon.

Wait, but in the current location (attic), the possible actions are interacting with the chest or cabinet, or moving north/south. The user just opened the door leading north, so maybe the next step is to go north again. But the original task said after opening the door in the attic, attempt to head north. So the user is supposed to go north from the attic. But the current prompt shows that after opening the door, the user is in the attic, and the door is now open. So the next action should be to go north. However, the user's last action was opening the door, and the response was "You open door." Then the next prompt shows the attic's description again. So the user needs to go north from here. But the user hasn't done that yet. The original task said after opening the door, attempt to move north. So the next command should be "go north". But the user is in the attic, and the attic has a closed door leading north. Wait, no, the current description says there's a closed door leading north. Wait, no, the user just opened the door. Wait, the previous step was opening the door, and the current state is that the door is open. So the user is in the attic, and the door leading north is open. So the next step is to go north. But the user hasn't done that yet. The original task said after opening the door, attempt to go north. So the next action is "go north". Then, after that, the user would be in the next room, perhaps the salon where the potato is. So the next command should be "go north".

-= Salon =-
Guess what, you are in the place we're calling the salon.

You make out a bookshelf. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

There is an open door leading south. There is an open gate leading east.

There is a potato on the floor.

Okay, the user is trying to pick up the potato in the Salon, but the game keeps saying "That's not a verb I recognise." So, maybe the correct command is "take potato" instead of "pick-up potato". Let me check the previous interactions. The user tried "pick-up potato" multiple times, but it's not working. In text adventures, the usual verb is "take" instead of "pick-up". So the correct command should be "take potato". Let me confirm the game's expected commands. Since the user is in the Salon and the potato is on the floor, the correct action is to take the potato. Therefore, the next action should be "take potato".
