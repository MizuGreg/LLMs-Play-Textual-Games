I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is how to play! First off, take a trip north. And then, make an effort to take a trip north. Following that, pick-up the key from the floor of the cellar. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Bathroom =-
Look at you, bigshot, walking into a bathroom like it isn't some huge deal.



There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Studio =-
You arrive in a studio. A normal kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's here.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

-= Cellar =-
You are in a cellar. A standard one.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

There is a key and an insect on the floor.
