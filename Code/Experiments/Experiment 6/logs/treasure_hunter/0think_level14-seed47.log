Welcome to TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First step, try to go to the west. And then, open the passageway. Then, make an attempt to travel south. Next, move east. Then, pick up the key from the floor of the closet. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Study =-
You've entered a study.

You can see a locked suitcase.

There is an open gate leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north.

There is an open passageway leading north. There is an unguarded exit to the east.

There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

There is a key on the floor.
