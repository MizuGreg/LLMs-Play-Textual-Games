I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! First stop, go south. And then, make an effort to travel east. After that, attempt to travel east. And then, go to the south. With that over with, open the gateway. After opening the gateway, take a trip west. Then, pick up the stick of butter from the floor of the kitchen. Alright, thanks!

You're now in a chamber.

You can make out a mantelpiece. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a mantelpiece, go to TextWorld. The mantelpiece is standard. But there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

You arrive in a cellar. An usual kind of place. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a chest. You check the price tag that the chest's owner still hasn't taken off. 15 bucks? What a deal! You'll have to ask where they got this!

There is an open gate leading south. There is an open passageway leading west. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Chamber =-
You're now in a chamber.

You can make out a mantelpiece. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a mantelpiece, go to TextWorld. The mantelpiece is standard. But there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

-= Cellar =-
You arrive in a cellar. An usual kind of place. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a chest. You check the price tag that the chest's owner still hasn't taken off. 15 bucks? What a deal! You'll have to ask where they got this!

There is an open gate leading south. There is an open passageway leading west. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked.
