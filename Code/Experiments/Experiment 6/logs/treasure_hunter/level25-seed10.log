Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text adventure game, and they've been moving between rooms: starting in the Bedroom, then going to the Vault, Restroom, and back. The original goal was to go south, then west, north, west, south, south again, east, east, and then pick up the candy bar in the laundry place.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Restroom again, and the next step according to the previous pattern was to go east. But after going east, they end up back in the Vault. The user has been cycling through these rooms multiple times. The challenge is to find the path that leads to the laundry place where the candy bar is.

The problem might be that the user is stuck in a loop between the Vault and Restroom. The original instructions mentioned moving west from the Vault, which leads to the Restroom, and then maybe needing to find another exit. But in the Restroom, the exits are east, north, south, and west. The user has tried going east, which brings them back to the Vault. Maybe they need to go north from the Restroom? But the Vault is north of the Restroom, so going north from the Restroom would take them back to the Vault. Wait, but the user's goal was to get to the laundry place. Maybe the laundry place is in a different part of the map.

Alternatively, perhaps the user needs to go south from the Restroom. The Restroom has an exit to the south, which is unblocked. If they go south from the Restroom, they might reach the Laundry place. But in the previous steps, when the user was in the Restroom, they tried going east, north, and west, but didn't try south. The instruction said to go south from the Restroom. Let me check the previous messages.

In the Restroom description, it says: "You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west." So the south exit is unblocked. So the user should try going south from the Restroom. But in the previous steps, the user kept going east, which loops back to the Vault. So the correct next step would be to go south from the Restroom to reach the Laundry place where the candy bar is. Therefore, the next action should be "go south".

-= Dish-Pit =-
Of every dish-pit you could have sauntered into, you had to saunter into a normal one. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You scan the room for a cabinet, and you find a cabinet. The cabinet is empty, what a horrible day!

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

You are in a laundry place. A typical kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

You can see a trunk.

There is a candy bar on the floor.
