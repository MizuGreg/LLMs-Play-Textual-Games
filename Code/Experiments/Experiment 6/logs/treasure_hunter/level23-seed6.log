Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, go north. After that, venture east. Then, take a trip north. Once you get around to doing that, try to move west. After that, try to take a trip west. With that done, make an effort to venture west. Okay, and then, recover the sandwich from the table inside the kitchen. And if you do that, you're the winner!
