I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is how to play! First, it would be a great idea if you could head north. And then, travel east. And then, make it so that the portal is ajar. After that, venture north. After that, recover the latchkey from the floor of the cubicle. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Shower =-
Well, here we are in a shower.

You make out a shelf. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is an open wooden door leading east. There is an open stone passageway leading north.
