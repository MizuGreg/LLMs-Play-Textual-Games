Welcome to another profound session of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First thing I need you to do is to travel north. After that, go to the west. If you can get around to doing that, take the scarf from the rack. Got that? Good!

-= Steam Room =-
I am stoked to announce that you are now in the steam room.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

go north

-= Studio =-
You arrive in a studio. A typical kind of place.

Were you looking for a stand? Because look over there, it's a stand. The stand is normal. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.

You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Pantry =-
You are in a pantry. A standard kind of place.

You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a workbench. The workbench is standard. However, the workbench, like an empty workbench, has nothing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. Hey, want to see a rack? Look over there, a rack. You see a scarf on the rack.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.
