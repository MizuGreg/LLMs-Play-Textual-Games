It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to attempt to go north. And then, make sure that the walnut gate is ajar. After that, take a trip west. Following that, make an effort to head south. If you can do that, retrieve the latchkey from the floor of the closet. Got that? Good!

-= Sauna =-
You arrive in a sauna. A typical kind of place.



There is an open passageway leading north. There is an open gateway leading south.

-= Bathroom =-
You've come into a typical room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be typical. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the bathroom.

You make out a cabinet. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a drawer. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a trunk.

There is a closed walnut gate leading west. There is an open passageway leading south.

You find yourself in a closet. An ordinary one. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You see a stand. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north.

There is a latchkey on the floor.
