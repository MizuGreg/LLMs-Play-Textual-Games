Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First, it would be great if you could go to the north. With that done, go to the west. Okay, and then, attempt to venture south. After that, move west. Then, pick up the hat from the floor of the attic. Got that? Good!

-= Bedchamber =-
You are in a bedchamber. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

Hey, want to see a coffer? Look over there, a coffer, so there's that. You can see a trunk.

You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.
