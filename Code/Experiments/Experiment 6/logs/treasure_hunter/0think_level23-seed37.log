Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First, it would be great if you could check that the non-euclidean door is unlocked with the non-euclidean passkey. Then, open the non-euclidean door. And then, venture east. If you can accomplish that, go north. After that, travel north. And then, make an attempt to go to the west. Then, pick up the knife from the board. That's it!

-= Recreation Zone =-
You are in a recreation zone. A typical kind of place.

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a box.

There is a closed non-euclidean door leading east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

-= Spare Room =-
You are in a spare room. A standard kind of place.
