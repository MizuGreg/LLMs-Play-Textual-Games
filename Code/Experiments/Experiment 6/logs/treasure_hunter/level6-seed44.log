Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. Your first objective is to make an effort to move east. Then, venture north. Then, pick-up the fork from the floor of the canteen. Got that? Good!

-= Washroom =-
Well, here we are in a washroom. The room is well lit.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded.

>                                                                                                                                -= Washroom =-0/1
AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go east
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Cubicle =-
You arrive in a cubicle. An usual one.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the north. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.



>                                                                                                                                -= Cubicle =-0/2
AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go north
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Canteen =-
You've just shown up in a canteen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a pear and a fork on the floor.
