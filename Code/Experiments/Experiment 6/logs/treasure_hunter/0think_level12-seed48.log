You make out a case!

There is an unguarded exit to the north. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

-= Spare Room =-
You are in a spare room. It seems to be pretty typical here. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

You see a workbench. The workbench is normal. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded.
