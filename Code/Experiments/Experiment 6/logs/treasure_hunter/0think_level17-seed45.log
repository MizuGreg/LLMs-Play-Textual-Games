You are now playing a fast paced game of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First thing I need you to do is to try to move east. Then, make an effort to take a trip north. And then, attempt to head north. Next, take a trip north. And then, take a trip west. Following that, make an attempt to go to the south. And then, pick-up the potato from the floor of the kitchenette. Alright, thanks!

-= Studio =-
You find yourself in a studio. A normal kind of place. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

-= Pantry =-
I am required to announce that you are now in the pantry.

You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a table. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

There is an unguarded exit to the north. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

-= Sauna =-
You find yourself in a sauna. An ordinary kind of place. You can barely contain your excitement.

You scan the room for a shelf, and you find a shelf. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You make out a board. You wonder idly who left that here. The board is usual. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

-= Kitchenette =-
If you're wondering why everything seems so usual all of a sudden, it's because you've just walked into the kitchenette.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

There is a potato and a sandwich on the floor.
