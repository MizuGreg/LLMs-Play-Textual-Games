I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First off, make an attempt to take a trip north. With that accomplished, pick up the passkey from the floor of the laundry place. That's it!

-= Workshop =-
You've entered a workshop. You begin looking for stuff.



There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

There is a mug on the floor.

go north
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Laundry Place =-
You find yourself in a laundry place. An usual one. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

There is a passkey on the floor.
