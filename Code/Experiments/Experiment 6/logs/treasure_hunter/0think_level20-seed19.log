Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an exciting round of TextWorld? You do! First off, travel west. With that done, pick up the latchkey from the floor of the kitchen. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Closet =-
You've entered a closet.

You see an opened chest. What a letdown! The chest is empty!

There is a closed hatch leading south. There is an open gateway leading west.

go west

-= Kitchen =-
You're now in the kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You smell a sickening smell, and follow it to a freezer. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You make out a closed case, which looks normal, in the corner. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a table. The table is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open gateway leading east. There is an open passageway leading north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

There is a latchkey on the floor.
