Welcome to TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First, it would be a great idea if you could attempt to head south. With that done, make an effort to take a trip west. Then, travel south. With that over with, make an effort to venture east. And then, move east. Then, pick-up the passkey from the floor of the bar. That's it!

-= Cookhouse =-
You find yourself in a cookhouse. A standard one.

You can see a closed chest in the corner. You see a counter. The counter is ordinary. But the thing is empty. Hm. Oh well

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

-= Studio =-
You find yourself in a studio. A typical one. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You make out a locked toolbox nearby. You can make out a closed bureau.

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the south. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

-= Scullery =-
You arrive in a scullery. Let's see what's in here.

Look over there! a case. You look around you, at all the containers and supporters, doors and objects, and you think to yourself. Why? Why Textworld? You can see a fridge. The fridge is empty! What a waste of a day!

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

-= Chamber =-
You're now in the chamber. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

There is a sandwich on the floor.

-= Laundromat =-
You've entered a laundromat.

You see a bench. The bench is typical. But the thing is empty.

There is an unblocked exit to the east. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text adventure game. The goal is to pick up the passkey from the bar's floor. So far, they've moved south, west, south again, and east. Now they're in the Laundromat.

Looking at the current location: Laundromat. The description mentions a bench, and exits to east, north, south, west. The user needs to find the passkey. The previous locations included a cookhouse, studio, scullery, chamber, and now laundromat. The passkey was supposed to be in the bar's floor, but maybe the path requires moving through these areas.

Wait, the original instruction said after moving east twice, pick up the passkey from the bar's floor. But the user is now in the laundromat. Maybe they need to go back or check other directions. The exits here are east, north, south, west. The user might need to go north to reach the bar. Let me check the previous steps again.

Original path: start at cookhouse, go south to studio, west to scullery, south to chamber, east to laundromat. So from laundromat, going north would take them back to the chamber. Then maybe west to scullery, then north to studio, then east back to cookhouse? But the passkey is in the bar. Wait, maybe the bar is in a different area. Or perhaps the passkey is in the laundromat? But the user's task was to go to the bar's floor. Maybe the laundromat is part of the path to the bar.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east from laundromat. But the laundromat's east exit is unblocked. But the passkey is in the bar. Maybe the bar is in the north direction. Wait, the user is in laundromat. The exits are east, north, south, west. So going north from laundromat would take them to the chamber again. Then maybe west to scullery, then north to studio, then east to cookhouse, but the cookhouse had a closed chest. Hmm.

Wait, the original instruction said after moving east twice, pick up the passkey from the bar's floor. So maybe the bar is in the studio or scullery? Or perhaps the passkey is in the laundromat. But the user hasn't found it yet. The current location is laundromat, and the user needs to check if the passkey is here. But the description says the bench is empty. Maybe the passkey is in the laundromat, but the user hasn't checked. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go back to the chamber and check again.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east from laundromat. Let me check the exits again. The laundromat has an unblocked exit to the east. So going east from here would take them to the next area. But the user's goal is to get to the bar's floor. Maybe the bar is in the east direction. But the user hasn't checked that yet. So the next step would be to go east, then check if the passkey is there. But the user's current location is laundromat, and the next action is to go east. But the user is supposed to pick up the passkey from the bar's floor. So perhaps the bar is in the east direction. But the user hasn't found it yet. So the next action should be to go east, then check the bar. But the user's previous steps were to go east again. Wait, the user is in laundromat, and the exit to the east is unblocked. So the user should go east. Then, perhaps the bar is there. But the user hasn't found the passkey yet. Alternatively, maybe the passkey is in the laundromat, but the user hasn't checked. However, the description says the bench is empty. So maybe the user needs to go back to the chamber, then check other directions. But the user's next action is to go east. So the correct next step is to go east. But the user's task is to pick up the passkey from the bar's floor. So maybe the bar is in the east direction. Therefore, the user should go east. But the user is in laundromat, so going east would be the next step. Then, in the next area, check for the passkey. So the next action is go east.
