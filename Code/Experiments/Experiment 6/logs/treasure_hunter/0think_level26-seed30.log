-= Shower =-
You've just sauntered into a shower. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unblocked exit to the north.

You see a closed standard looking chest nearby. You can make out a fridge. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a rack. The rack is ordinary. On the rack you make out a key, so there's that. You see a saucepan. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.
