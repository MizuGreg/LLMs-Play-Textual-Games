Welcome to TextWorld! First stop, make an effort to venture west. After that, try to take a trip south. Then, take the licorice strip from the board inside the washroom. That's it!

-= Playroom =-
You find yourself in a playroom. A standard kind of place.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the south. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

-= Salon =-
Well, here we are in the salon. Let's see what's in here.



There is an open gate leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

-= Washroom =-
Fancy seeing you here. Here, by the way, being the washroom. You can barely contain your excitement.

You can see a rack. However, the rack, like an empty rack, has nothing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a board. On the board you can make out a licorice strip.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north.
