Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First off, attempt to move east. And then, recover the apple from the floor of the canteen. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Kitchen =-
You've entered a kitchen.

You see a rack. The rack is ordinary. But the thing is empty. You move on, clearly done caring about your TextWorld experience.

There is an open passageway leading south. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

go east
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Canteen =-
You find yourself in a canteen. An ordinary one.

You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a saucepan. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You move on, clearly done caring about your TextWorld experience.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

There is an apple and a passkey on the floor.
