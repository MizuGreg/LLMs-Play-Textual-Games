I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First thing I need you to do is to go to the south. And then, make an effort to take a trip east. After that, make an effort to head south. And then, pick up the fondue from the floor of the cookhouse. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Shower =-

There is an unguarded exit to the south.
