Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an exciting round of TextWorld? You do! Here is how to play! First stop, recover the fresh laundry scented latchkey from the floor of the laundry place. Then, try to head south. And then, unlock the fresh laundry scented door in the salon. After that, make it so that the fresh laundry scented door is ajar. Having opened the fresh laundry scented door, attempt to take a trip south. With that accomplished, recover the American style keycard from the shelf in the studio. After that, unlock the American style gateway with the American style keycard. And then, doublecheck that the American style gateway inside the studio is ajar. And then, make an effort to take a trip east. With that done, go to the east. Then, attempt to travel south. With that done, open the gateway. Then, make an effort to travel west. After that, pick up the berry from the floor of the kitchen. And if you do that, you're the winner!

You see a bookshelf. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

Well, here we are in the pantry. You begin to take stock of what's here.

A locked chest is nearby.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.
