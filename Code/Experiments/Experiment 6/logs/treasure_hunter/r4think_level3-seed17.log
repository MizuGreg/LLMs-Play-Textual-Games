Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, try to take a trip north. And then, recover the fondue from the floor of the pantry. Alright, thanks!

Of every kitchen you could have sauntered into, you had to walk into an ordinary one.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north.

You've just walked into a bar.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to recover the fondue from the pantry. They started in the kitchen, went north to the pantry, then kept moving between the kitchen and pantry. Now they're in the bar. The goal is to get the fondue from the pantry floor.

So far, they've been going back and forth between the kitchen and pantry. The pantry has the fondue, but they need to get it. The current location is the bar. The user is asking if they're making the right moves and if they're close to the goal.

Wait, the fondue is on the floor of the pantry. So the key is to get into the pantry, pick up the fondue, and then exit. But the user has been moving between kitchen and pantry. They are now in the bar, which is a new location. The bar has exits to east and west. But the pantry is probably still accessible from the kitchen. 

The user's previous actions were going north (to pantry), then south (back to kitchen), then north again (to pantry), and now east (to bar). So they might be stuck in a loop. The fondue is in the pantry, so they need to get into the pantry, pick it up, and then exit. But they haven't picked it up yet. 

The user is in the bar now. The pantry is probably not directly accessible from the bar. So maybe they need to go back to the kitchen, then north to the pantry again. Once in the pantry, they can pick up the fondue. Then exit through the north or south direction. 

But the user is asking if they're close. They might be going in circles. The next step should be to go back to the pantry. So from the bar, go west back to the kitchen, then north to the pantry again. Then pick up the fondue. 

But the user's last action was going east to the bar. Now they need to go west back to the kitchen. Then north to the pantry. Then pick up the fondue. So the next command should be 'go west' to return to the kitchen.
