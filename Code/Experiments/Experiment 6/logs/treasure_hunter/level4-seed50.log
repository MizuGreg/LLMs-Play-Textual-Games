Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, venture north. With that done, pick up the stick of butter from the floor of the basement. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Kitchenette =-
You've just shown up in a kitchenette. The room is well lit.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.
