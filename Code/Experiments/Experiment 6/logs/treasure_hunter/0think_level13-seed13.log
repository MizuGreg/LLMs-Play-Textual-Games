You are now playing a profound session of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First off, attempt to go to the south. That done, venture east. Then, make an attempt to head east. That done, pick up the passkey from the floor of the bar. Got that? Good!

-= Scullery =-
You arrive in a scullery. Let's see what's in here.

Look over there! a case. You look around you, at all the containers and supporters, doors and objects, and you think to yourself. Why? Why Textworld? You can see a fridge. The fridge is empty! What a waste of a day!

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an unguarded exit to the south.
