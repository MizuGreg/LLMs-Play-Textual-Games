Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, you could, like, make an effort to venture west. And then, make an effort to travel south. And then, head west. And then, make an attempt to venture north. And then, make an effort to go west. Once you get through with that, venture south. After that, pick up the licorice strip from the board inside the washroom. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Cubicle =-
You are in a cubicle. An usual kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

You can see a locked safe. You can see a stand. The stand appears to be empty.

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unblocked exit to the south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.
