-= Cubicle =-
You've entered a cubicle. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You make out a closed safe. You can make out a desk. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset.

There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

There is a telephone on the floor.
