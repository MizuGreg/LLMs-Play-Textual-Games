I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First, it would be good if you could attempt to travel east. Then, make an attempt to head north. After that, open the portal. After that, attempt to move west. After that, try to venture north. Then, move west. And then, pick-up the latchkey from the floor of the kitchen. And once you've done that, you win!
