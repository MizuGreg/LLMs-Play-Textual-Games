Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. Your first objective is to make an effort to head south. With that over with, go to the west. Following that, travel north. And then, attempt to move north. Once you do that, retrieve the stick of butter from the floor of the steam room. And once you've done that, you win!
