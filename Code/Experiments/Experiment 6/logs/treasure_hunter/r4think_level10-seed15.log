Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game and has been moving through different rooms: bedchamber, shower, canteen, and now the kitchenette. The goal mentioned earlier was to retrieve the banana from the workshop. So far, they've gone south from the bedchamber, then south again to the shower, then west to the canteen, and now they're in the kitchenette.

In the kitchenette, the description mentions a bowl on the floor. The user is asked if they think they're making the right actions and if they're close to the goal. The previous steps involved moving through rooms, but the banana is in the workshop. The user hasn't mentioned picking up any items yet, only moving. The next step would be to check if there's a way to get to the workshop. The current room is the kitchenette, and the exits mentioned are east and north. The user might need to go north from the kitchenette to proceed towards the workshop. Alternatively, maybe there's a path through the east exit, but the workshop hasn't been encountered yet. Since the goal is to get to the workshop and take the banana, the next logical step is to continue moving north from the kitchenette. So the command should be "go north".

-= Workshop =-
