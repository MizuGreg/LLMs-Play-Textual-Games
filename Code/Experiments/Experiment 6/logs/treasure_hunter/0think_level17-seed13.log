Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an exciting round of TextWorld? You do! Here is how to play! First, it would be good if you could attempt to head west. With that done, make an effort to take a trip south. Then, travel west. With that over with, make an effort to venture south. And then, move east. Then, move east. With that done, recover the passkey from the floor of the bar. And once you've done that, you win!
