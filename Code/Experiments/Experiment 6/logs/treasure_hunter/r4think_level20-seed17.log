-= Cookery =-
You are in a cookery. A typical one.

Hey, want to see a case? Look over there, a case. What's that over there? It looks like it's a chair. You shudder, but continue examining the chair. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Silly chair, silly, empty, good for nothing chair.

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game, and they've been given a series of instructions. The current scenario is in a bathroom, with a closed gateway west and an exit east. The user tried to go west but was told to open the gateway first. They successfully opened it, and now the next step is to proceed.

The user is asking if they're on the right track and if they're close to the goal. The original task mentioned going west, checking the gateway, opening the hatch, then proceeding to the office, portal, attic, and retrieving a potato. So far, they've opened the gateway and moved west. The next steps in the original plan were to travel west again, open the hatch, then go west again, open the portal in the office, venture north, check the attic door, go north again, and get the potato.

But in the current state, after opening the gateway, the user is in the bathroom. The next logical step would be to go west through the now-open gateway. However, the user might need to check if there's a hatch or another object to open. But according to the previous steps, after opening the gateway, they should travel west. So the next action should be "go west" again. But the user is in the bathroom, and the gateway is west. So after opening it, they should go through it. The response after opening the gateway was "You open gateway." Then the next step is to go west. But the user might need to check if there's a hatch or another object. However, the original plan says after opening the gateway, travel west. So the next action is "go west".

-= Kitchen =-
If you're wondering why everything seems so typical all of a sudden, it's because you've just shown up in the kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.



There is an open gateway leading east. There is a closed hatch leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps given in the original task. They started in the cookery, went west to the bathroom, opened the gateway, then went west again to the kitchen, opened the hatch, went west to the office, opened the portal, went north to the attic, opened the door. Now, they're in the attic, having opened the door. The next step in the original plan was to "attempt to venture north" after ensuring the attic door is open. But the user already opened the door and went north to the attic. Wait, maybe the original goal was to retrieve the potato from the salon's floor. So after the attic, the next steps would be to go north from the attic, then recover the potato. But in the current state, the user is in the attic, which has a closed door north and an open portal south. They just opened the door, so maybe they need to go north again. But the original plan said after opening the attic door, try to venture north. So the next action should be "go north". But the user is in the attic, and the door leading north is open. So they can go north. Then, after that, they would reach the next room, perhaps the salon, where the potato is. So the next command is "go north".

-= Salon =-
Guess what, you are in the place we're calling the salon.

You make out a bookshelf. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

There is an open door leading south. There is an open gate leading east.

There is a potato on the floor.
