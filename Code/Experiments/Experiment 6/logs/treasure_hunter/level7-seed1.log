Welcome to TextWorld! Here is how to play! Your first objective is to venture east. And then, go north. And then, travel north. With that over with, pick up the passkey from the floor of the cookery. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Dish-Pit =-
Well, here we are in the dish-pit. You start to take note of what's in the room.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

-= Cookhouse =-
You arrive in a cookhouse. A typical one.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game called TextWorld. The goal is to venture east, then north, then north again, pick up the passkey from the cookery, and win.

So far, the user started in the Dish-Pit. They went east to the Cookhouse. Now, the current location is the Cookhouse. The prompt says there's an exit to the north and west. The user's previous action was "go east", which brought them to the Cookhouse.

The user is asking if they're making the right moves and if they're close to the goal. Let me check the steps again. The original plan was: go east (done), then go north (once), then north again. Then pick up the passkey.

In the Cookhouse, the exits are north and west. The user needs to go north from here. The next step would be to go north. But wait, the original instruction says after going east, go north, then north again. So from the Cookhouse, going north would be the first north step. Then from there, another north. Then go to the cookery and pick up the passkey.

So the next action should be "go north" from the Cookhouse. The user is at Cookhouse, so that's the correct next step. The user is on the right track. They've done the first east, then the first north. The next step is the second north. Then they'll reach the cookery area where the passkey is. So the next action is definitely "go north".
</think>go north

-= Studio =-
This might come as a shock to you, but you've just entered a studio.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game called TextWorld. The goal is to venture east, then north, then north again, pick up the passkey from the cookery, and win.

So far, the user has gone from the Dish-Pit east to the Cookhouse, then north to the Studio. The current location is the Studio. The directions available here are north, south, and west. The prompt says that north is unblocked, south is unguarded, and west is unblocked. 

The original plan was to go east, then north, then north. But after the first east, they went north to the Studio. Now, they need to go north again to continue toward the cookery. But the user is asking if they're on the right track and if they're close to the goal.

Wait, the passkey is in the cookery. The user is in the Studio now. The previous steps were Dish-Pit → Cookhouse → Studio. The next step should be to go north again from the Studio to reach the cookery. But the user is at the Studio, and the directions are north, south, west. The cookery is probably in the north direction. So the next action should be to go north again. But the user is asking if they're close. The user might be confused if they've taken the wrong path. But according to the initial instructions, after going east, then north, then north, they should be in the cookery. So from Studio, going north would take them to the cookery. Then they can pick up the passkey. So the next action should be go north.

-= Cookery =-
You arrive in a cookery. A normal kind of place. You can barely contain your excitement.



You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a passkey on the floor.

Okay, let me figure out what to do next. The user has been moving through different rooms: Dish-Pit, Cookhouse, Studio, and now Cookery. The original goal was to venture east, then north, then north again, pick up the passkey from the cookery floor, and win.

So far, the user went east from Dish-Pit, then north to Cookhouse, then north again to Studio, and then north once more to Cookery. Now, in Cookery, the passkey is on the floor. The next step should be to pick it up. But the user's last action was "go north", which led them to Cookery. The prompt says to pick up the passkey from the floor. So the next command should be to pick up the passkey. However, in TextWorld-style games, sometimes you need to pick up items by using a command like "take passkey" or "get passkey". But the user's previous actions were all "go north" or "go east". Wait, in the Cookery room, the message says "There is a passkey on the floor." So the correct action here is to pick it up. The user's last action was moving north, so now they're in Cookery. The next step is to pick up the passkey. But the user's instruction says to only output the action, like "go north". So maybe the correct command here is "take passkey" or "get passkey". However, looking back at the initial instructions, the user was told to "pick up the passkey from the floor of the cookery". So the correct action here is to pick it up. But the user's previous actions were all movement commands. However, in TextWorld, sometimes you need to use "take" or "get" to pick up items. But maybe in this game, the command is just "pick up passkey". Alternatively, maybe the game expects "take passkey". But the user's previous actions were "go east", "go north", etc. So perhaps the correct command here is "take passkey". However, the user's instruction says to only output the action, so maybe "take passkey" is the right command here. Alternatively, maybe the game allows just "passkey" but that's less likely. Let me check the previous interactions. The user was told to "pick up the passkey from the floor of the cookery". So the correct action is to pick it up. Therefore, the next command should be "take passkey" or "get passkey". But in the context of the game, maybe the correct command is "pick up passkey". However, the user's previous actions were all movement commands. But in this case, the passkey is on the floor, so the player needs to pick it up. Therefore, the correct command is "take passkey".
