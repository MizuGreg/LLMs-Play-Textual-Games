You are now playing a life changing session of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First thing I need you to do is to try to go to the north. And then, pick-up the latchkey from the floor of the scullery. That's it!

-= Pantry =-
You've entered a pantry. You begin to take stock of what's here.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an unguarded exit to the south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a key on the floor.
