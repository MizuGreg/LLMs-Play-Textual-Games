Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First stop, attempt to go to the north. That done, pick-up the licorice strip from the floor of the spare room. Got that? Good!

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.



There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

-= Spare Room =-
You are in a spare room. A normal kind of place.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

There is a licorice strip and a passkey on the floor.
