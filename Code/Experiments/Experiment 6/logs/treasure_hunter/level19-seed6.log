Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, go west. With that accomplished, lift the chocolate bar from the floor of the workshop. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Kitchenette =-
You've just walked into a kitchenette.

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a cabinet. You can make out a saucepan. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

-= Workshop =-
You are in a workshop. A standard kind of place. You begin looking for stuff.



There is an unguarded exit to the east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

There is a chocolate bar and a broccoli on the floor.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to lift the chocolate bar in the Workshop. They've tried "lift the chocolate bar" multiple times, but the game keeps saying it's not a recognized verb. Hmm, maybe the correct command is just "lift chocolate bar" without the article "the"? Or perhaps there's a different verb they should use. Wait, in some text adventures, you have to use specific verbs like "take" instead of "lift". Let me check the previous interactions. The user first tried "lift the chocolate bar", which was rejected. Then they tried again, and the system kept saying the same thing. Maybe the correct command is "take chocolate bar"? Or maybe "get chocolate bar"? Alternatively, maybe the game expects "lift" without the article. Let me think. The user's last attempt was "lift the chocolate bar" again, and the system still says it's not a verb. So perhaps the correct command is just "lift chocolate bar" without "the". Alternatively, maybe the game uses "take" as the verb. But the user has been using "lift" so far. Wait, maybe the game is case-sensitive? Like "Lift" with a capital L? But the user has been using lowercase. Alternatively, maybe the game expects "pick up" instead of "lift". But the user has been using "lift". Hmm. Since the user is stuck, maybe they need to try a different verb. Let me think of possible commands. The user's goal is to lift the chocolate bar. So possible commands could be "take", "get", "pick up", "lift". Since "lift" is not working, maybe "take" is the correct verb here. Let me try that. So the next action should be "take chocolate bar". Alternatively, maybe "get chocolate bar". But the user has been using "lift", so maybe the game is expecting that. Wait, but the system says "That's not a verb I recognise." So perhaps "lift" is not the correct verb. Maybe the correct verb is "take". Let me check the game's possible commands. Since the user is in the Workshop, and there's a chocolate bar on the floor, the correct action is probably "take chocolate bar" or "get chocolate bar". So the next step should be to try "take chocolate bar".
