Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, go west. With that accomplished, lift the chocolate bar from the floor of the workshop. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Kitchenette =-
You've just walked into a kitchenette.

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a cabinet. You can make out a saucepan. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Workshop =-
You are in a workshop. A standard kind of place. You begin looking for stuff.



There is an unguarded exit to the east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

There is a chocolate bar and a broccoli on the floor.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they need to perform specific actions. The goal is to go west, lift the chocolate bar, and then stop. So far, they've gone west from the kitchenette into the workshop. The current location is the workshop, and there's a chocolate bar on the floor.

The user is asking if they're on the right track and what their next action should be. The previous steps were correct: going west from the kitchenette to the workshop. Now, the next logical step is to pick up the chocolate bar. The prompt mentions that once the chocolate bar is lifted, they can stop. So the next action should be to take the chocolate bar. The user needs to lift it from the floor. The command should be "take chocolate bar" or similar. But in the game's context, maybe the exact command is "lift chocolate bar" or "pick up chocolate bar". The user has to use the correct verb. The previous action was "go west", so the next is to interact with the chocolate bar. The response should be the command to lift it.
</think>lift chocolate bar

That's not a verb I recognise.

Okay, the user tried to "lift chocolate bar" but the game didn't recognize it. Let me check the possible commands. In TextWorld games, actions are usually verbs like "take", "pick up", or "get". The correct command here should be "take chocolate bar" or "pick up chocolate bar". Since the user was instructed to "lift the chocolate bar from the floor", maybe "lift" is the intended verb, but the game might expect "take" instead. Let me confirm the valid actions. The game's response after the first command was "go west", which worked. Then, the user tried "lift chocolate bar", which was invalid. So the correct command is likely "take chocolate bar". I should respond with that.
