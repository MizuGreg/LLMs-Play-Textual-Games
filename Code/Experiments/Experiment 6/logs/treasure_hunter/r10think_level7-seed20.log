Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First thing I need you to do is to attempt to go west. And then, attempt to head south. With that over with, make an attempt to venture east. Okay, and then, retrieve the loaf of bread from the floor of the garage. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Salon =-
Well how about that, you are in a place we're calling a salon.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

You find yourself in a study. A typical kind of place. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is in a text-based game where they have to navigate through different rooms and retrieve a loaf of bread from the garage. The current setup seems to be looping between the Salon and Study rooms, with the user repeatedly being told to go west or east.

First, the user's initial instructions were to go west, then south, then east, and finally retrieve the bread. But in the current state, the user is stuck in a loop between the Salon and Study. Every time they try to go west, they end up back in the Salon, and going east takes them to the Study again. The exits mentioned are west and south in the Salon, and east and south in the Study. But the user hasn't found a way to get to the garage yet.

Wait, the original goal was to retrieve the bread from the garage's floor. So maybe the user hasn't found the garage room. The current rooms are Salon and Study. The user needs to find a path to the garage. Let me check the possible exits again. In the Salon, going west is unblocked, but that just loops back. The Study has an exit to the south, which might be a different room. But in the previous steps, when the user went east from the Salon, they ended up in the Study, and going west from the Study takes them back to the Salon. So maybe the south exit from the Study is the key. Let me check the previous messages.

In the Study, the user is told there's an exit to the south. So maybe going south from the Study is the way to go. The user hasn't tried that yet. The user's last action was going east again, which took them back to the Study. So the next logical step would be to go south from the Study. That might lead to another room, perhaps the garage. Once in the garage, the user can look for the bread on the floor.

So the user needs to go south from the Study. The current prompt is in the Study, so the next action should be "go south". That's the missing step. The user has been looping between west and east, but the south exit from the Study is unblocked and might lead to the garage. Let me confirm: the user's last position was the Study, and the instruction says there's an exit to the south. So "go south" is the correct next action.
</think>go south

-= Sauna =-
Ah, the sauna. This is some kind of sauna, really great normal vibes in this place, a wonderful normal atmosphere. And now, well, you're in it.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

There is a keycard on the floor.
