You are now playing a profound game of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First off, make an attempt to take a trip south. Then, open the hatch. And then, go south. Then, take a trip west. With that over with, move south. Then, travel east. Then, pick-up the sandwich from the floor of the workshop. Alright, thanks!

-= Chamber =-
You arrive in a chamber. A standard one.

You can see a shelf. But there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is an open passageway leading south. There is an open gateway leading west.

-= Study =-
I just think it's great that you've just entered a study. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

You see a chair. The chair is usual. However, the chair, like an empty chair, has nothing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is a closed hatch leading south. There is an open passageway leading north.

There is a keycard on the floor.
