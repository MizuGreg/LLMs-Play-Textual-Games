It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First thing I need you to do is to travel south. Next, travel west. That done, pick-up the fly larva from the floor of the cookhouse. That's it!

-= Study =-
Of every study you could have walked into, you had to come round an usual one. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You see a locked coffer. You make out a trunk. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You scan the room for a stand, and you find a stand. The stand is typical. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is a closed gate leading west. There is an open gateway leading east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

-= Vault =-
You make a grand eccentric entrance into a vault. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You see a suitcase. You make out a counter. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the counter.

You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they have to navigate through different rooms and collect items. The goal is to pick up the fly larva from the cookhouse. So far, they've gone south, then west, and back north, but they're still in the Vault room.

Looking at the current room description, the Vault has a suitcase and a counter. The user needs to find the fly larva, which is in the cookhouse. The previous steps involved moving between the Study and Vault rooms. The next logical step would be to check the suitcase or the counter for any items. But the description says the counter has nothing, so maybe the suitcase has the fly larva. Alternatively, there's an unguarded exit to the west, which might lead to another room. But the user hasn't checked the suitcase yet. Since the user's goal is to pick up the fly larva, they need to find where it's located. The cookhouse is mentioned in the initial task, so maybe the cookhouse is another room they need to reach. However, the current room is the Vault, and the user has to find the correct path. The user might need to check the suitcase first. If the suitcase has the fly larva, then they can pick it up. If not, they might need to go west through the unguarded exit. But according to the previous steps, the user has already gone south, then west, then north. The current room is Vault, so maybe the next step is to check the suitcase. Alternatively, the user might need to go west again. But the user's last action was going north, so the current room is Vault. The user needs to check the suitcase or look for other items. Since the task is to pick up the fly larva from the cookhouse, maybe the user needs to go back to the Study room and then proceed to the cookhouse. But the user is in the Vault now. The user might need to check the suitcase first. Let me check the previous steps again. The initial task was to go south, then west, then pick up the fly larva. The user has already gone south, then west, but maybe they didn't reach the cookhouse yet. Wait, the initial instructions said after going south and west, pick up the fly larva from the cookhouse. So maybe the cookhouse is in the Vault room? Or maybe the user needs to go west from the Vault. The Vault has an unguarded exit to the west. So perhaps the user should go west from the Vault to reach the cookhouse. But the user is currently in the Vault, and the next action would be to go west. However, the user's last action was going north, so they are in the Vault. The user needs to check if the fly larva is in the Vault or if they need to go west. The initial task says to pick up the fly larva from the cookhouse, so maybe the cookhouse is a different room. The user might need to go west from the Vault to reach the cookhouse. Therefore, the next action should be to go west.

-= Cookhouse =-
You're now in the cookhouse.

You can make out a locked case, which looks usual, in the room.

There is a closed portal leading north. There is an open hatch leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a fly larva on the floor.

Okay, the user is trying to pick up the fly larva in the Cookhouse. They've tried "pick-up fly larva" multiple times, but the game keeps rejecting it. Let me check the possible commands. In text adventures, the correct verb is usually "take" instead of "pick-up". The user might be using the wrong verb. The fly larva is on the floor, so maybe the correct command is "take fly larva" or "get fly larva". Since the game doesn't recognize "pick-up", I should suggest the correct verb. The next action should be to take the fly larva using the proper command.
