Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, you could, like, head south. Then, make an effort to move west. And then, attempt to go to the north. And then, recover the sandwich from the floor of the chamber. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Washroom =-
Well, here we are in a washroom. The room is well lit.



There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.
