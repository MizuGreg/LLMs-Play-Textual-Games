Welcome to another profound game of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First off, open the hatch. After that, make an attempt to move west. Next, ensure that the portal is open. And then, make an attempt to head north. And then, doublecheck that the door is ajar. And then, travel north. And then, pick-up the potato from the floor of the salon. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Kitchen =-
If you're wondering why everything seems so typical all of a sudden, it's because you've just shown up in the kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.



There is a closed hatch leading west. There is an open gateway leading east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Office =-
You are in an office. A typical kind of place.

You can see a display.

There is an open hatch leading east. There is a closed portal leading north.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in the Office now. The previous steps were opening the hatch, going west, which led here. The goal is to eventually pick up the potato in the salon. Let me check the current environment.

In the Office, there's a display. The hatch leading east is open, and a portal north is closed. The original task mentioned ensuring the portal is open. Wait, the user had to "ensure that the portal is open" after moving west. So maybe the portal here is the one they need to open?

But the current location is the Office. The next steps according to the original task were: after moving west, check the portal is open, then go north, then check the door is ajar, then go north again, then pick up the potato.

Wait, the user is in the Office. The portal leading north is closed. So the next step should be to open that portal. But how? The user has to interact with it. The command would be "open portal" or "open north portal". But in TextWorld, the commands are usually more direct. Let me check the available actions. The user can interact with objects. The portal is closed, so maybe the correct command is "open portal".

But the user's next action should be to open the portal leading north. So the next command is "open portal".
