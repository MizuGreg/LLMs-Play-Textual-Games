You are now playing a profound round of TextWorld! First step, try to venture north. Next, go to the north. And then, pick up the loaf of bread from the floor of the launderette. Got that? Good!

-= Playroom =-
You arrive in a playroom. You begin to take stock of what's here.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Welcome to the basement. Let's see what's in here.
