Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an profound round of TextWorld? You do! First stop, move west. Then, try to go to the west. And then, go to the north. Once you get around to doing that, travel east. Then, move north. And then, go west. Once you manage that, pick-up the key from the floor of the cubicle. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Steam Room =-
I just think it's awesome that you're in a steam room now. Let's see what's in here.

You can see an opened cabinet in the room. The cabinet is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever!

There is an unguarded exit to the north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.
