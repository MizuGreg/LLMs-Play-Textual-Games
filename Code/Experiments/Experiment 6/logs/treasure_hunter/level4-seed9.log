I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is how to play! First stop, make an effort to go north. Following that, pick-up the teapot from the floor of the canteen. Alright, thanks!

-= Sauna =-
You've just walked into a sauna. Let's see what's in here.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

-= Canteen =-
You've entered a canteen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.



You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a keycard and a teapot on the floor.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in a text adventure game. They started in the sauna, went north to the canteen. Now they're in the canteen, which has a keycard and a teapot on the floor. The original goal isn't explicitly mentioned, but usually in these games, collecting items like the teapot might be part of a puzzle or reaching a destination.

The user's previous action was "go north" from the sauna to the canteen. Now, in the canteen, they need to pick up the teapot. The instruction said to pick up the teapot from the floor of the canteen. So the next logical step is to pick up the teapot. The user hasn't done that yet. The keycard is also there, but the teapot is mentioned first in the initial instruction. So the correct action here is to pick up the teapot. The user should say "take teapot" or "pick up teapot". The system only accepts the command as a short action, so "take teapot" is probably the right command here.
