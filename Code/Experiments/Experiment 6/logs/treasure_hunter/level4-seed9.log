I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is how to play! First stop, make an effort to go north. Following that, pick-up the teapot from the floor of the canteen. Alright, thanks!

-= Sauna =-
You've just walked into a sauna. Let's see what's in here.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

-= Canteen =-
You've entered a canteen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.



You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a keycard and a teapot on the floor.
