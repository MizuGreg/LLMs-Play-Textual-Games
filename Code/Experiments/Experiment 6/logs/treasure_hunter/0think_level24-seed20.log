Okay, and then, recover the loaf of bread from the counter inside the pantry. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Sauna =-
You've walked into a standard room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be standard. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the sauna.

You make out a box. You see a board. The board is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unblocked exit to the west.
