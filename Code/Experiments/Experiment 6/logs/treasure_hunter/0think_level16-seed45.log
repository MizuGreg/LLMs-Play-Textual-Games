You are now playing a fast paced game of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First thing I need you to do is to try to move north. Then, ensure that the door is open. And then, head west. After that, make an attempt to head west. After that, take a trip south. With that over with, pick-up the potato from the floor of the kitchenette. Alright, thanks!

-= Lounge =-
You are in a lounge. An ordinary kind of place.

You smell an intriguing smell, and follow it to a bed stand. The bed stand is standard. However, the bed stand, like an empty bed stand, has nothing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the bed stand.

There is an unblocked exit to the north.

Well, here we are in the washroom.



There is an open door leading east. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

-= Cookery =-
Look at you, bigshot, walking into a cookery like it isn't some huge deal. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

You scan the room for a chest, and you find a chest. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a pan. But there isn't a thing on it.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Kitchenette =-
If you're wondering why everything seems so usual all of a sudden, it's because you've just walked into the kitchenette.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

There is a potato and a sandwich on the floor.
