Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First step, make an attempt to go to the west. Then, try to take a trip north. And then, recover the poem from the floor of the bedchamber. Alright, thanks!

-= Sauna =-
You find yourself in a sauna. A typical one.



There is an open passageway leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

There is a sponge on the floor.

-= Spare Room =-
You are in a spare room. A typical one.

You can make out an opened ordinary looking cabinet in the corner. The cabinet is empty, what a horrible day!

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.
