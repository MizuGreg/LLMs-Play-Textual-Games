Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First step, make an attempt to go to the west. Then, try to take a trip north. And then, recover the poem from the floor of the bedchamber. Alright, thanks!

-= Sauna =-
You find yourself in a sauna. A typical one.



There is an open passageway leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

There is a sponge on the floor.

-= Spare Room =-
You are in a spare room. A typical one.

You can make out an opened ordinary looking cabinet in the corner. The cabinet is empty, what a horrible day!

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they need to follow specific steps. The initial instructions were to go west, then north, and recover a poem from the bedchamber. So far, they went west from the sauna into the spare room. Now, they're in the spare room, which has a cabinet that's empty. The next step according to the original plan was to go north. But the user is asking if they're on the right track and what their next move should be.

Looking at the current room description: the spare room has an exit to the north. The user's next action should be to go north, as per the initial plan. The cabinet is empty, so maybe that's a red herring. The goal is to get to the bedchamber and retrieve the poem. So moving north from the spare room would be the logical next step. The user needs to follow the directions given initially: go west, then north. So the next command should be "go north".
</think>go north

-= Bedchamber =-
You find yourself in a bedchamber. An usual kind of place.



There is an unblocked exit to the east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

There is a poem on the floor.

Okay, let me figure out what to do next. The user's goal is to recover the poem from the floor of the bedchamber. So far, they've gone west, then north, and now they're in the bedchamber where the poem is on the floor.

The current room is the bedchamber. The poem is on the floor, so the next logical step is to pick it up. The user's last action was going north, which led them here. Now, they need to take the poem. The command should be "take poem" or something similar. But in the game's context, maybe the correct command is "take poem from floor" or just "take poem". Since the poem is on the floor, the correct action is to take it. The user has to interact with the poem directly. So the next command should be "take poem".
</think>take poem
