Welcome to TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First, it would be a great idea if you could venture south. And then, go east. And then, travel north. With that over with, make an effort to go north. With that done, pick-up the passkey from the floor of the cookery. Got that? Good!

-= Spare Room =-
If you're wondering why everything seems so standard all of a sudden, it's because you've just shown up in the spare room.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

There is a keycard on the floor.

Well, here we are in the dish-pit. You start to take note of what's in the room.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing a text-based game called TextWorld. The current room is the Dish-Pit. The user has been told to first go south, then east, then north, and then pick up the passkey from the cookery. But the user is now in the Dish-Pit, and the next step is to figure out the correct path.

Looking at the current room description: the Dish-Pit has an exit to the east and north, both unguarded. The user's previous action was going south from the Spare Room to the Dish-Pit. The original task was to go south, then east, then north. But the user is now in the Dish-Pit, and the next step might be to go east as per the initial instructions.

But wait, the user is in the Dish-Pit. The original plan was to go south (from the start), then east, then north. But after going south once, they are in the Dish-Pit. The next step in the original plan was to go east. So the user should go east from the Dish-Pit. Then, after going east, they would be in another room. But the user is now in the Dish-Pit, so the next action should be to go east. However, the user is asking if they're making the right moves and if they're close to the goal.

Alternatively, maybe the user is confused. Let me check the room descriptions again. The Spare Room had a keycard on the floor. The user was told to pick up the passkey from the cookery. But in the Spare Room, there's a keycard. Wait, the initial instruction said to pick up the passkey from the cookery. But in the Spare Room, there's a keycard. Maybe that's a clue. But the user is now in the Dish-Pit. So perhaps the next step is to go east from the Dish-Pit. But the user is asking if they're on the right track.

The original plan was: go south (to Dish-Pit), then east, then north. Then pick up the passkey from the cookery. So after going east from the Dish-Pit, the user would be in another room. Then go north. But the user is in the Dish-Pit now. So the next action should be to go east. That's the next step in the original plan. Therefore, the correct next action is to go east.

-= Cookhouse =-
You arrive in a cookhouse. A typical one.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

Okay, let's see. The user has been moving through different rooms in the game. The original task was to venture south, then east, then north, and then pick up the passkey from the cookery. 

First, they started in the spare room, went south to the dish-pit, then east to the cookhouse. Now, in the cookhouse, the instructions say to go north or west. The user's next step should be to go north because that's part of the original plan. But wait, the cookhouse's description mentions an unguarded exit to the west. However, the original goal was to pick up the passkey from the cookery. Maybe the passkey is in the cookhouse. The user needs to check the floor for the keycard. The previous room (dish-pit) had a keycard on the floor, but maybe in the cookhouse there's the passkey.

Wait, the user's task was to pick up the passkey from the floor of the cookery. So the cookhouse is the cookery. The user is currently in the cookhouse. The passkey might be here. The user should look for it. But the current prompt says to go north or west. The user's previous action was going east to the cookhouse. The original plan was to go north after east. So maybe the next step is to go north. But the cookhouse's north exit is unblocked. Alternatively, maybe the passkey is in the cookhouse, so the user should check the floor here. But the user's next action is to go north or west. Since the original plan was to go north after east, the next step should be north. But the user needs to pick up the passkey. Maybe the passkey is in the cookhouse. So the user should check the floor here. But the command is to go north or west. So perhaps the correct next step is to go north. But the user needs to collect the passkey. Wait, the initial task said to pick up the passkey from the cookery's floor. So maybe the passkey is in the cookhouse. So the user should check the floor here. But the user's next action is to go north or west. So perhaps the user should go north first. But the user's previous action was east, then the next step is north. So the answer is go north.

-= Studio =-
This might come as a shock to you, but you've just entered a studio.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game, and they've been moving through different rooms. The original task was to venture south, then east, then north, pick up the passkey from the cookery. Let me check the history.

First, they started in the Spare Room, went south to the Dish-Pit, then east to the Cookhouse, then north to the Studio. Now they're in the Studio. The current room description says there's an unguarded exit to the south and unblocked north and west. The user is asked if they're on the right track and close to the goal. 

The passkey was supposed to be in the cookery, which is the Cookhouse. The user is now in the Studio. So maybe they need to go back to the Cookhouse. But the current room's exits are north, south, west. Wait, the Cookhouse was previously visited. Maybe the passkey is in the Cookhouse, so they need to go back. But the user is in the Studio. So perhaps the next step is to go south back to the Cookhouse. But the user's last action was going north to the Studio. So from the Studio, going south would take them back to the Cookhouse. Then they can check the cookery area for the passkey. Alternatively, maybe the passkey is in the Studio, but the original instruction said to pick it up from the cookery. So the user needs to go back to the Cookhouse. So the next action should be to go south from the Studio to return to the Cookhouse. Then check the cookery area. But the user hasn't picked up the key yet. So the correct next step is to go south to the Cookhouse again. But the user is in the Studio now. So the next command is go south.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game, and they've been moving around different rooms. The original task was to venture south, then east, then north, pick up the passkey from the cookery. Let me check the history.

Starting in the Spare Room, they went south to the Dish-Pit, then east to the Cookhouse. Then they went north to the Studio, then south back to Cookhouse. Now, in the Cookhouse again, the prompt says to go north or west. The user's last action was going south from Studio to Cookhouse. Now, they need to pick up the passkey from the cookery. Wait, the initial instruction mentioned picking up the passkey from the floor of the cookery. So maybe the passkey is in the Cookhouse. But in the Cookhouse description, there's no mention of a keycard or passkey. However, in the Spare Room, there was a keycard on the floor. But the user hasn't picked that up yet. Wait, the original task said to pick up the passkey from the cookery. Maybe the passkey is in the Cookhouse. But in the current Cookhouse description, there's no mention of it. Hmm.

Wait, looking back at the previous steps: After entering the Cookhouse (0/3), the user went north to Studio (0/4), then south back to Cookhouse (0/5). So maybe the passkey is in the Cookhouse, but it's not mentioned here. Or perhaps the passkey is in the Dish-Pit? Or maybe the user needs to check the rooms again. Alternatively, maybe the passkey is in the Studio. But the user hasn't checked there yet. Wait, the initial instruction said to pick up the passkey from the floor of the cookery. So cookery is the Cookhouse. But in the Cookhouse description, there's no mention of a passkey. However, in the Spare Room, there was a keycard. Maybe the user needs to collect that first? But the original task said to pick up the passkey from the cookery. Maybe there's a mistake in the room descriptions. Alternatively, maybe the passkey is in the Cookhouse, and the user needs to look for it. But the current Cookhouse description doesn't mention it. So perhaps the user needs to check the rooms again. The next step would be to go west or north from the Cookhouse. The user's last action was going south to Cookhouse, so now they are in Cookhouse again. The options are north or west. The original task was to go north after the initial steps. Maybe the passkey is in the Studio? But the user hasn't checked there. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west from Cookhouse. Let me check the previous steps again. The user's path is: Spare Room -> Dish-Pit -> Cookhouse (0/3) -> Studio (0/4) -> Cookhouse (0/5). So maybe the passkey is in the Cookhouse, but it's not mentioned. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west from Cookhouse. The instruction says to try going west. So the next action would be go west. But the user's last action was going south, so now in Cookhouse, the options are north or west. The user needs to pick up the passkey. Since the original task mentioned the passkey is in the cookery (Cookhouse), maybe the user needs to check the Cookhouse again. But the description doesn't mention it. Maybe the user needs to go west. Alternatively, maybe the passkey is in the Studio. But the user hasn't checked there. Wait, the user is in Cookhouse again. The next step is to go west or north. The user's previous actions were going north to Studio, then south back. Maybe the passkey is in the Studio. But the user hasn't checked there. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west from Cookhouse. The user's next action should be go west. But the user's last action was going south, so now in Cookhouse, the options are north or west. The user needs to pick up the passkey. Since the original task says to pick it up from the cookery (Cookhouse), maybe the user needs to check the Cookhouse again. But the description doesn't mention it. Maybe the user needs to go west. Let me think. The user is in Cookhouse (0/5), and the options are north or west. The user's next action should be go west. But the user's previous steps didn't mention a passkey. Maybe the user needs to check the rooms again. Alternatively, maybe the passkey is in the Dish-Pit. But the user hasn't checked there. Hmm. Maybe the user needs to go west from Cookhouse.

Okay, let's see. The user has been moving through different rooms in the game: starting in the spare room, then the dish-pit, cookhouse, studio, and back to the cookhouse. The original task was to venture south, then east, then north, pick up the passkey from the cookery.

Wait, the user mentioned the passkey is in the cookery's floor. So maybe the cookhouse is part of that. The current location is the dish-pit again. The previous steps were going south from the studio, which brought them back to the cookhouse, then west to the dish-pit. Now, in the dish-pit, they need to find the passkey. But the dish-pit's description doesn't mention a key. However, the initial instruction said to pick up the passkey from the floor of the cookery. Maybe the cookery is a different room. Wait, maybe the cookhouse is part of the cookery? Or perhaps there's a room called cookery that's not yet visited.

Looking at the room descriptions: the cookhouse is a typical one, with exits north and west. The dish-pit has exits east and north. The studio has exits north, south, west. The spare room has south and east. The user's path has been: spare room (south) -> dish-pit (east) -> cookhouse (north) -> studio (south) -> cookhouse (west) -> dish-pit (now). So maybe the cookery is the cookhouse? Or perhaps the cookery is a different room. The original task said to pick up the passkey from the floor of the cookery. So the user needs to find that room.

But in the current dish-pit, there's no mention of a passkey. The user might have missed it earlier. Wait, in the cookhouse, when they were there earlier, maybe the passkey was there. But the user hasn't checked the cookhouse again. Alternatively, maybe the cookery is the studio? Or another room. Alternatively, maybe the passkey is in the dish-pit, but the description doesn't mention it. The user needs to check all possible rooms.

But according to the initial instructions, the user was told to pick up the passkey from the floor of the cookery. So the user needs to find the cookery room. The cookhouse might be part of that. Alternatively, maybe the cookery is the studio. But the user is currently in the dish-pit. The next step would be to check the north exit from the dish-pit, which is unguarded. Going north from dish-pit would take them to the cookhouse again. Then, perhaps check the cookhouse for the passkey. Alternatively, maybe the passkey is in the cookhouse. The user needs to go north from the dish-pit to the cookhouse, then check if the passkey is there. So the next action should be to go north from the dish-pit.

Okay, let's see. The user has been moving through different rooms in the game. The original task was to venture south, then east, then north, and pick up the passkey from the cookery. But the current location is the Spare Room, where there's a keycard on the floor.

Wait, the user's last action was going north from the Dish-Pit back to the Spare Room. Now, in the Spare Room, the keycard is present. The original goal mentioned picking up the passkey from the cookery. But here, the keycard is in the Spare Room. Maybe "passkey" and "keycard" are the same item here. So the next step should be to pick up the keycard.

But the user's instruction says to only output the action. So the correct command would be to take the keycard. However, in TextWorld, sometimes you have to use specific commands like "take keycard" or "get keycard". But the user's previous actions were all "go directions", so maybe the correct action here is to pick up the keycard by using the "take" command. But the user's history shows that when they were in the Spare Room, the keycard was on the floor, and the next step would be to pick it up. So the answer should be "take keycard".
