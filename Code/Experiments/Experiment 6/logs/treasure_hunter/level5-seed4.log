Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First off, make an attempt to travel north. With that over with, take a trip north. That done, pick up the knife from the floor of the cookhouse. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Parlor =-
Guess what, you are in a place we're calling a parlor. The room is well lit.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

-= Shower =-
This might come as a shock to you, but you've just moved into a shower. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.
