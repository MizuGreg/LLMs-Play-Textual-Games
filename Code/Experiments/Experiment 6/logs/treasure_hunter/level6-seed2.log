Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First thing I need you to do is to travel east. And then, venture south. Then, pick up the latchkey from the floor of the workshop. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Kitchen =-
Well, here we are in the kitchen.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Bedchamber =-
You arrive in a bedchamber. An ordinary kind of place. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.



You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game. The goal is to go east, then south, pick up the latchkey from the workshop, and win. So far, they started in the kitchen, went east to the bedchamber. Now they're in the bedchamber, which has an exit to the south and west.

The user is asking if they're on the right track and if they're close to the goal. The current location is the bedchamber. The next step would be to go south, as per the initial instructions. The user has already gone east once, so the next step is south. Then, after that, they need to go west to reach the workshop where the latchkey is. But the user is asking if they're close. Since they've already done the first two steps (east and south), they're moving towards the workshop. The next action should be south from the bedchamber. The user's next command should be "go south".
</think>go south

-= Workshop =-
You've just sauntered into a workshop.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the north.

There is a gummy bear and a latchkey on the floor.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, let me figure out what to do next. The user has to pick up the latchkey from the workshop and then win. So far, they've gone east from the kitchen to the bedchamber, then south to the workshop. Now in the workshop, there's a gummy bear and a latchkey on the floor.

The original goal was to go east, then south, then pick up the latchkey. Wait, the user's path so far is kitchen -> bedchamber -> workshop. The directions mentioned in the workshop description say there's an unguarded exit to the north and east. But the user needs to pick up the latchkey first. Since the latchkey is on the floor here, the next logical step is to pick it up. But the game might require interacting with it, like taking it. However, the user's previous actions were moving directions. The instruction says to pick up the latchkey, so the correct action here is to take the latchkey. But the game's commands might be limited to movement and interacting with objects. Since the user is in the workshop, and the latchkey is there, the next step is to pick it up. So the command should be "take latchkey" or "pick up latchkey". But looking at the previous interactions, the user has only moved, so maybe the correct command here is to take the latchkey. However, the user's previous actions were movement commands. The game might require using "take" or "get" for objects. So the next action should be to take the latchkey.
</think>take latchkey
