Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First stop, go west. And then, venture west. Okay, and then, recover the latchkey from the case in the cellar. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Cookhouse =-
You are in a cookhouse. An ordinary kind of place. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You can see an opened chest in the room. The chest is empty, what a horrible day! Look over there! a pan. The pan is ordinary. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is an open wooden portal leading east. There is an open passageway leading west.

-= Scullery =-
You're now in a scullery. Let's see what's in here.

You can see a plate. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to a table. The table is standard. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open passageway leading east. There is an open portal leading south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Bathroom =-
You find yourself in a bathroom. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You make out a board. You shudder, but continue examining the board. But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is an open portal leading north. There is an open hatch leading west. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east.

You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

You make out a board. You shudder, but continue examining the board. But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is an open portal leading north. There is an open hatch leading west. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east.

-= Workshop =-
You are in a workshop. A standard one. You begin looking for stuff.

You make out a closed bureau close by. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a mantelpiece. The mantelpiece is ordinary. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.
