I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, head east. Then, make an effort to travel south. After that, attempt to go west. And then, retrieve the carrot from the floor of the chamber. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Spare Room =-
You find yourself in a spare room. A typical one.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.
