It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to take a trip south. After that, try to go to the south. After that, go to the south. Once you manage that, head south. And then, pick-up the key from the floor of the canteen. Alright, thanks!

-= Workshop =-
Well, here we are in the workshop. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

There is a latchkey on the floor.
