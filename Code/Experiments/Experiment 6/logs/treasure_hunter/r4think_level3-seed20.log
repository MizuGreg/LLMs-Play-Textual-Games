It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to head east. And then, pick-up the loaf of bread from the floor of the garage. Alright, thanks!

-= Sauna =-
Ah, the sauna. This is some kind of sauna, really great normal vibes in this place, a wonderful normal atmosphere. And now, well, you're in it.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

There is a keycard on the floor.

Well, here we are in the garage. You start to take note of what's in the room.



There is an unblocked exit to the west.

There is a loaf of bread on the floor.

That's not a verb I recognise.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game, and they've been given some commands. The goal seems to be to pick up the loaf of bread from the garage. 

First, the user started by going east, which led them to the sauna. Then they tried to pick up the bread, but the game didn't recognize that command. Wait, no—the user actually went east, then the next room was the garage. In the garage, there's a loaf of bread on the floor. The user tried to "pick-up loaf of bread," but the game said that's not a recognized verb. Oh, right, maybe the correct command is just "take loaf of bread" or "get bread." But in some text adventures, the verb is "take" instead of "pick-up."

Wait, looking back at the previous interaction: the user wrote "pick-up loaf of bread," and the game responded with "That's not a verb I recognise." So the game probably expects a different command. Maybe "take" is the correct verb here. So the next step would be to use "take loaf of bread" or "take bread." But the user might have made a typo, like using "pick-up" instead of "take." 

Alternatively, maybe the game uses "get" as the verb. But in many games, "take" is more common. So the correct command should be "take loaf of bread." But the user might not know that, so they need to try again. 

Also, the user is asking if they're on the right track. They've reached the garage, which is the correct location for the bread. So the next action should be to pick up the bread using the correct verb. Since the game didn't accept "pick-up," the user needs to try "take" instead. 

So the next action should be "take loaf of bread." That's the most likely correct command here. The user might have used the wrong verb, so correcting that would proceed the game.
