I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! First of all, go to the north. With that done, retrieve the latchkey from the floor of the closet. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Attic =-
You're now in an attic. You begin looking for stuff.

You see a locked toolbox close by. You make out a workbench. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The workbench is normal. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well

There is an unguarded exit to the north.

go north

-= Closet =-
You arrive in a closet. A normal kind of place.

Were you looking for a table? Because look over there, it's a table. The table is ordinary. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is an open passageway leading north. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

There is a latchkey on the floor.
