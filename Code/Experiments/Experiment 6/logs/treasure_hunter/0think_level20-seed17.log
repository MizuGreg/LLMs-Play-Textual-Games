You are in a cookery. A typical one.

Hey, want to see a case? Look over there, a case. What's that over there? It looks like it's a chair. You shudder, but continue examining the chair. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Silly chair, silly, empty, good for nothing chair.

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.
