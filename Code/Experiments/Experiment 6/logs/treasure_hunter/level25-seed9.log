You are now playing a profound session of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First thing I need you to do is to head west. Then, try to head south. Then, make an effort to move west. Following that, venture west. With that over with, move north. If you can get around to doing that, head east. Okay, and then, make an effort to move north. And then, travel north. After that, head west. Once you do that, try to take a trip west. That done, recover the paper towel from the safe. And once you've done that, you win!

You've just walked into a bathroom.

You make out a trunk. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see an opened dresser close by. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this?

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing a text adventure game and has a specific sequence of movements to follow. The goal is to navigate through different rooms and eventually recover the paper towel from the safe.

First, the user started in the Bathroom, went west to the Playroom. Now, in the Playroom, the next steps according to the initial instructions are: after going west, then south, then west again, then north, east, north, north, west, west, then retrieve the paper towel.

Looking at the current room (Playroom), the available exits are east, south, and west. The user's next move should be south as per the plan. But wait, the user's previous action was going west from the Bathroom to the Playroom. The next step in the instructions is to go south. So the next command should be "go south". But I need to check if that's the correct direction based on the current room's description.

The Playroom's description mentions an unguarded exit to the south. So going south is possible. The user's next action should be "go south" to follow the sequence. Then, after that, the next steps would be west again, then north, etc. So the correct next command is "go south".

-= Vault =-
You are in a vault. An ordinary kind of place. The room is well lit.

You make out a shelf. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Hopefully, this discovery doesn't ruin your TextWorld experience! You can make out a table. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

Okay, let's see. The user has a specific sequence of movements they need to follow. Let me recap the steps they outlined:

1. Head west.
2. Try to head south.
3. Make an effort to move west.
4. Venture west.
5. Then move north.
6. If possible, head east.
7. Then move north again.
8. After that, head west.
9. Then take a trip west.
10. Recover the paper towel from the safe.
11. Win.

So far, the user has moved from the Bathroom to the Playroom (west), then to the Playroom's south (which took them to the Vault). Now, in the Vault, they need to follow the next steps. Let's check the current location: Vault. The exits here are north and west. 

The next step in their plan after getting to the Vault is to move north (step 5). But wait, the user's current step after the Vault is step 5: move north. However, in the Vault, the exit to the north is unguarded. So the next action should be to go north. But let me check the user's current position again.

Wait, the user's current location is the Vault. The next step in their plan is after moving west (step 4: venture west), then move north (step 5). Wait, maybe I need to track the sequence more carefully.

Original steps:

After the initial west (Bathroom to Playroom), then south (Playroom to Vault). Then, the user's next steps are:

3. Make an effort to move west. (From Vault, west is an exit)
4. Venture west. (So from Vault, go west)
5. Then move north. (After moving west, then north)
6. If possible, head east.
7. Then move north again.
8. After that, head west.
9. Then take a trip west.
10. Recover paper towel.

But in the current state, the user is in the Vault. The exits are north and west. The next step according to the original plan is after moving west (step 3 and 4). Wait, maybe I need to re-express the steps in order.

Original steps:

1. Go west (from Bathroom to Playroom)
2. Go south (Playroom to Vault)
3. Go west (Vault to west)
4. Go west again (from there)
5. Go north
6. Go east
7. Go north
8. Go west
9. Go west again
10. Get paper towel.

But in the current state, the user is in the Vault. The next step after step 2 (south) is step 3: make an effort to move west. So from the Vault, go west. So the next action should be go west. Then, after that, step 4 is venture west again. So after going west from Vault, the next step would be to go west again. But let me check the current location.

In the Vault, the user can go west. So the next action is go west. Then, from there, they would be in another room. Let me check the previous steps again.

The user's current location is the Vault. The next step in their plan is step 3: move west. So the next action is go west. Then, step 4 is venture west again. So after moving west once, they need to move west again. But perhaps the user is at the Vault, and the next step is to go west. So the correct next action is go west. Then, from there, they would be in a new room, and then proceed with the next steps.

But the user's current prompt says that in the Vault, the exits are north and west. So the next action is go west. Then, after that, they would be in a room that has exits. Let me check the previous steps again. The user's next action should be go west. Then, after that, they need to go west again (step 4), then move north (step 5), etc.

So the next action is go west.

-= Cubicle =-
You've just shown up in a cubicle.

You can make out an opened display. What a letdown! The display is empty! Hey, want to see a bureau? Look over there, a bureau.

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following a specific sequence of directions: west, south, west, west, north, east, north, north, west, west, then retrieve the paper towel from the safe. So far, they've moved through Bathroom -> Playroom -> Vault -> Cubicle. The current location is Cubicle.

The next step in their plan is after moving west twice, then north, east, north, north, west, west. But let's check the current position. The user is in the Cubicle, and the exits are east, north, and west. The original goal was to get around to doing those directions and then recover the paper towel.

Wait, the user's original task was to head west, then south, then west, then west, then north, then east, then north, then north, then west, then west, then get the paper towel. So after the Cubicle, the next move would be north (as per the sequence: after west, move north). But in the Cubicle, the exits are east, north, west. So moving north from Cubicle would be the next step. Then, after that, they need to go east, north, north, west, west. But the user's next action here is to go north. Let me confirm the sequence again.

Original steps: After the first four moves (west, south, west, west), the next was north. Then east, then north, then north, then west, then west. So after the Cubicle, moving north would be the next step. Then from there, maybe east, then north, etc. So the next action should be go north.

-= Office =-
You are in an office. An ordinary one.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Okay, let's see. The user has been moving through different rooms in TextWorld, following a specific sequence of directions. The goal is to eventually recover the paper towel from the safe and win the game.

So far, they've gone west from the bathroom, then south to the vault, west again to the cubicle, and north to the office. The next step in their original plan was to head east after moving north. But in the office, the available exits are east, north, south, and west. The user's next action should be to go east as per the initial instructions. 

But wait, the user's original task mentioned after moving north, they should head east. So in the office, going east makes sense. However, the user might need to check if that's the correct direction. But since the game's feedback in the office says there's an unguarded exit to the east, it's safe to proceed. 

So the next command should be "go east" to follow the plan. Then, after that, the next steps would be moving north again, then west, etc., as per the original instructions. The user needs to stick to the sequence given. 

I need to make sure that each movement is in the correct order. The user has done the first few steps correctly. Now, in the office, going east is the next step as per the original plan. So the answer is "go east".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a specific path in the TextWorld game. Their original instructions were to move in a certain sequence: west, south, west, west, north, east, north, north, west, west, then retrieve the paper towel from the safe.

So far, the user has moved from the Bathroom to Playroom, then to Vault, Cubicle, Office, and back to Playroom. Now, they tried to go north from Playroom but couldn't. The current location is Playroom, and the available exits are east, south, and west. The user's next step after failing to go north would need to be one of those other directions.

Looking back at the original plan, after getting to Playroom again (step 6), the next action was supposed to be "go north" (step 7), but that's blocked. So the user needs to adjust their path. Maybe they need to go east again, then find another way. Alternatively, perhaps they should go south from Playroom to get back to the Vault or another area where the safe is located. But the user's goal is to get to the safe and retrieve the paper towel. 

Wait, the original instructions mention moving around and then recovering the paper towel from the safe. So the safe must be in one of the previous locations. The user has been moving through different rooms: Bathroom, Playroom, Vault, Cubicle, Office. The safe might be in the Office or another room. But the user hasn't found it yet. 

Since the user is stuck in Playroom and can't go north, the next logical step would be to try another direction. The available exits are east, south, or west. The user might need to go east again to check the next room, or south to go back to the Vault. Alternatively, going west might lead to another exit. 

The user's next action should be to try a different direction. Since they tried north and it's blocked, maybe go east again. But the user's original plan after Playroom (step 6) was to go north, which is blocked. So perhaps the correct path is to go east again, then proceed further. Alternatively, maybe the safe is in the Office, so going north from Playroom isn't possible, but going east to the Office might be the way. Wait, in the Office description, there's an exit to the east, south, and west. Maybe the safe is in the Office. The user needs to check there. 

But the user is currently in Playroom, and the next step is to try a different direction. Since they can't go north, the next possible move is east, south, or west. The user's original plan after Playroom was to go north, but that's blocked. So maybe the user should go east again, then check the Office. Alternatively, go south to the Vault. But the user's goal is to get to the safe. 

Given that the user hasn't found the safe yet, and the safe is mentioned in the original task, the user needs to explore the Office. So from Playroom, going east would lead to Office. Then, in the Office, maybe the safe is located. So the next action should be to go east again. But the user tried that already? Wait, the user's previous steps: after Playroom (step 6), they went east to Playroom again (step 7), but that's not possible. Wait, no, the user was in Playroom (step 6), then tried to go north (step 7), which is blocked. Then the user is back in Playroom. So the next action would be to try another direction. 

The available exits are east, south, west. The user's original plan after Playroom was to go north, which is blocked. So the user needs to try another direction. Let's check the exits again. The Playroom has exit to east, south, west. The user's next action should be to go east again, then proceed to Office. But the user might have already been there. Alternatively, go south to Vault. But the user's goal is to get to the safe. 

Alternatively, maybe the safe is in the Office. So the user needs to go east to Office, then check there. So the next action is go east. But the user tried that already? Wait, in the previous steps, the user was in Playroom (step 6), then tried to go north (blocked), then the next action is to go east again. But in the current state, the user is in Playroom, and the next action is to go east again. However, the user's previous move was to go east from Office to Playroom (step 5). So maybe the user needs to go south from Playroom to Vault. 

But the user's original plan was to move around and then get to the safe. The safe is probably in the Office or another room. Since the user is stuck in Playroom, the next step is to try a different direction. The user should go east again, then check the Office. So the next action is go east.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of movement commands in this TextWorld game. Their goal is to navigate through different rooms and eventually recover the paper towel from the safe.

Starting from the Bathroom, they went West to the Playroom, then South to the Vault, West again to the Cubicle, North to the Office, East back to the Playroom, North again which was blocked, then East to the Bathroom again. Now they're in the Bathroom again, and the last action was 'look', which didn't change the room. 

The current room is the Bathroom, and the user is asked if they're on the right track. The next step would be to check the possible exits again. The Bathroom has an unblocked exit to the West and a suggested exit to the North. Since the user has been moving west and north in previous steps, maybe they need to try going North from here. But the original plan was to head west, then south, then west, then west, then north, east, north, then west, then west again, and finally get the paper towel.

Wait, the user is at the Bathroom again. The original instruction mentioned recovering the paper towel from the safe. Maybe the safe is in a different room. The user hasn't found any items yet. The trunk and dresser are mentioned, but they're empty. Maybe the paper towel is in the safe in one of the rooms they've passed through. 

But the current room is the Bathroom. The exits are West and North. The user might need to go North from here. However, in the previous steps, when they tried to go North from the Playroom, it was blocked. But in the Bathroom, North is suggested as an unblocked exit. So perhaps going North from the Bathroom is possible. Let's check the previous descriptions. 

In the Bathroom, the user is told: "You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an unblocked exit to the west." So both North and West are possible. The user's next action should be to go North, as per the original plan. But the user's last action was 'look', which didn't move them. So the next command should be 'go north' again. Alternatively, maybe the safe is in the Bathroom, but the trunk and dresser are empty. Maybe the paper towel is in the safe in another room. 

But according to the original instructions, after moving around, the user needs to recover the paper towel from the safe. So maybe the safe is in the Vault or another room. However, the user hasn't found any safe yet. The current room is the Bathroom, and the exits are West and North. The user needs to proceed towards the safe. Since the user is at the Bathroom, perhaps the next step is to go West again, but the original plan had them go West, then South, etc. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go North from the Bathroom. Let's check the original steps again. The user's plan was: head west, then south, then west, then west, then north, east, north, west, west, then get the paper towel. So after the initial movements, they might have reached a room where the safe is. But in the current state, they're in the Bathroom again. Maybe they need to go North from here to proceed further. 

So the next action should be 'go north' to continue towards the safe. Alternatively, maybe the safe is in the West direction. But the user has already been to the Playroom and other rooms. Perhaps the safe is in the Office or another room. But without more information, the next logical step is to go North from the Bathroom as per the available exits.

The instructions given at the start outline a specific sequence of movements: go west, then south, west again, west again, north, east, north, north, west, west again, and finally retrieve the paper towel.

So far, the user has moved through several rooms: Bathroom → Playroom → Vault → Cubicle → Office → Playroom → Bathroom → Launderette. The current location is the Launderette, and the next step according to the initial instructions is to go north again. However, the user's last action was going north from the Bathroom to the Launderette. Now, the next step in the original plan was to travel north from the Launderette, but the user hasn't done that yet.

Looking at the current room (Launderette), the exits are north, south, and west. The user's next action should be to go north, as per the original plan. But the user might be confused because they might think they need to find the safe or the paper towel. However, the instructions don't mention any specific items except for the paper towel in the safe. So, following the sequence, after reaching the Launderette, the next step is to go north. The user hasn't done that yet, so the correct next action is to go north again.

Wait, but the user's last action was going north to the Launderette. The next step in the original plan was to "travel north" from the Launderette. So the user should go north again. However, the user might not know if that's the right path. But according to the instructions, after reaching the Launderette, the next step is to go north. So the correct command here is "go north".

There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in TextWorld, following a specific sequence of directions. The goal is to eventually recover the paper towel from the safe and win the game.

So far, the user has moved through the Bathroom, Playroom, Vault, Cubicle, Office, Playroom again, then to the Bathroom, Launderette, and now the Studio. The current room is the Studio, and the user is supposed to continue following the initial instructions: after moving north from the Launderette, they went to the Studio. Now, the next step in the original task was to "head east" after moving north, but the user might have missed that.

Looking at the current room (Studio), the available exits are south and west. The user's previous actions have been going north, west, etc., but they need to check if they're on the right path. The original plan was to move north, then east, then north again, then west, etc. However, in the Studio, the user can go south or west. Since the original instruction after moving north from the Launderette was to head east, but the Studio doesn't have an east exit, maybe the user needs to go west from the Studio. But the original plan said after moving north, head east. Wait, maybe there's a confusion here.

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go west from the Studio. The original task mentioned after moving north, head east, but if that's not possible, perhaps the user needs to find another way. However, the user's previous steps might have deviated. The key is to check if the user is on the correct path to reach the safe where the paper towel is. Since the user hasn't found the paper towel yet, they need to continue exploring.

In the Studio, the user can go south or west. The original plan after the Studio might involve moving west to reach the safe. Alternatively, maybe the safe is in a previous room. But the user hasn't encountered any safe yet. The initial rooms had a trunk and a dresser, but nothing mentioned about a safe. Maybe the safe is in the Laundry room or another area. The user needs to continue moving through the rooms, checking each time for the safe or the paper towel.

Since the user is in the Studio, the next logical step might be to go west, as that's an available exit. The original instructions said after moving north, head east, but if that's not possible, perhaps the user needs to explore other paths. Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go south from the Studio. However, the original plan after moving north from the Launderette was to head east, but the Studio doesn't have an east exit. Therefore, perhaps the user needs to go west from the Studio to continue the path. The user's next action should be to go west.

Okay, so you're in an attic, cool, but is it usual? You better believe it is.

You can see a chest. You make out a rack. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the north. There is an unguarded exit to the south. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

Okay, let's see. The user has been moving through different rooms in the game, following a specific path. The goal is to recover the paper towel from the safe and then win. So far, they've gone through Bathroom → Playroom → Vault → Cubicle → Office → Playroom → Bathroom → Launderette → Studio → Attic.

Now, in the Attic, the prompt mentions a chest and a rack. The user needs to find the paper towel in the safe. The previous steps involved moving west, north, south, etc., but maybe the safe is in one of these locations. The current room is the Attic, and the exits are east, north, south, and west. The user is supposed to look for the paper towel in the safe. Since the Attic has a chest, maybe that's where the safe is. Alternatively, the safe could be in another room, but the user needs to check all possibilities.

The user's next action should be to check the chest in the Attic. The command would be "open chest" or "look chest". But the game might require specific commands. Since the user has been using "go" commands, maybe they need to look inside the chest. Alternatively, if the chest is a safe, they might need to open it. However, the user's previous actions have been moving around, so maybe the safe is in the Attic. The user needs to check the chest here. The correct command would be "open chest" or "look chest". But the user's previous actions were "go" commands, so maybe "look" is the right action here. But the user just did "go west" to get to the Attic. So the next step is to check the chest. The answer should be "open chest" or "look chest". But the user's previous actions were "look" in the Bathroom. Wait, in the Bathroom, the user did "look" and then "go north". So maybe the correct command here is "open chest" to check if the paper towel is there. Alternatively, the safe might be in another room, but the user needs to check the chest in the Attic. So the next action is "open chest".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a sequence of movements in the TextWorld game. Their goal is to navigate through different rooms and eventually recover the paper towel from the safe.

So far, they've moved west, south, west, west, north, east, north, and now they're in the Attic. The current room is the Attic, where there's a chest that's welded shut. The user tried to open it, but it's locked. The next step would be to figure out how to proceed from here.

The user's next action should be to check the other exits in the Attic. The description mentions exits to the east, north, south, and west. Since the chest is welded shut, maybe the paper towel isn't here. They need to explore other rooms. The instruction says to try moving west again, as per the original plan. But the user might need to check if there's another way to get the paper towel. Alternatively, maybe the safe is in another room, and they need to find it. But according to the original task, after moving around, they need to recover the paper towel from the safe. So perhaps the safe is in the Attic, but the chest is a different object. Wait, the user is in the Attic, and there's a chest. Maybe the safe is a different object. But the user tried to open the chest, which is welded. So maybe they need to look for another way to get the paper towel. Alternatively, maybe the safe is in the bathroom, as the original plan mentions going back to the bathroom. But the user is in the Attic now. The next step would be to check the exits again. The user's next action should be to try moving west again, as per the original plan. But the user might need to check if there's a way to get the paper towel from another location. However, the original task says to recover the paper towel from the safe. So maybe the safe is in the bathroom, and the user needs to go back there. But the user is in the Attic. So the next step would be to move west again, as per the original plan. But the user is in the Attic, and the exits are east, north, south, west. So moving west from the Attic would take them back to the previous room, which was the Studio. But the user's original plan was to go west, then north, then east, etc. Maybe the user needs to go back to the bathroom where the trunk and dresser are. But the user is in the Attic. So the next action would be to move west again. But the user tried to open the chest, which is welded. So maybe they need to check other exits. But the user's next action should be to move west again, as per the original plan. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check the other exits. However, the user's original plan was to move west, then south, then west, etc. So perhaps the user needs to continue moving west from the Attic. But the user is in the Attic, and the exit to the west is unguarded. So the next action would be to go west again. But the user's previous action was trying to open the chest, which didn't work. So maybe the user needs to check the other exits. However, the user's next action should be to go west again, as per the original plan. So the answer is to go west.

Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game where they have to navigate through different rooms and eventually recover a paper towel from a safe. So far, they've moved through several locations: bathroom, playroom, vault, cubicle, office, playroom again, then bathroom, launderette, studio, attic, and now the basement.

The current room is the basement, and the user has to decide their next move. The goal is to get the paper towel from the safe. In the attic, they tried to open a chest but it was welded shut. Now in the basement, there's a cabinet and a workbench. The exits are east, south, and west.

The user's previous action was going west, which led them to the basement. Now, they need to figure out the next step. Since the goal is to find the paper towel, maybe the cabinet or workbench has something. But the workbench is described as empty. The cabinet might be the place to check. However, the user hasn't interacted with the cabinet yet. But in the attic, the chest was welded shut, so maybe the cabinet here is similar. Alternatively, maybe the safe is in another location.

Wait, the original instruction said to "recover the paper towel from the safe." So the safe is probably in one of these rooms. The user has to find it. So far, they've checked the trunk in the bathroom, the shelf in the vault, the display in the cubicle, the bureau in the cubicle, the table in the vault, the dresser in the bathroom, the chest in the attic. None of those had the paper towel. Maybe the safe is in the basement. The cabinet in the basement might be the safe. But the user hasn't opened it yet. However, in the attic, the chest was welded shut. So maybe the cabinet here is also locked. Alternatively, maybe the workbench has something, but it's described as empty.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to find the safe in another room. But the current room is the basement. The exits are east, south, and west. The user has to check the cabinet. But since the workbench is empty, maybe the cabinet is the place. However, the user hasn't tried opening it. But the previous attempt to open the chest in the attic failed. So maybe the cabinet here is also locked. But the user hasn't tried opening it yet. So the next action should be to open the cabinet. But the user's last action was going west, so now they are in the basement. The possible actions are to check the cabinet or try the exits. Since the goal is to find the paper towel, the cabinet is the most likely place. So the next action should be to open the cabinet. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the correct next step is to open the cabinet.

But the user's last action was opening the cabinet, and the response was "You open the cabinet." So now, the next action should be to look inside the cabinet to see if there's anything useful. The user needs to check the contents of the cabinet to proceed further. Since the game is text-based, the correct command would be "look in cabinet" or "look inside cabinet." But the user might need to use the correct syntax. Alternatively, maybe there's a specific item they need to take.

They've been moving around different rooms: bathroom, playroom, vault, cubicle, office, launderette, studio, attic, basement. Now they're in the basement, looking at a cabinet and a workbench. The cabinet was empty, and looking on the workbench didn't find anything.

The original goal was to recover the paper towel from the safe. So far, the user hasn't found any clues about a safe or a paper towel. The cabinets and chests they've checked haven't had anything. Maybe the safe is in another location they haven't checked yet. Let's think about the previous rooms. The vault had a shelf and a table, but nothing on them. The trunk in the bathroom was mentioned, but it's just a trunk. Maybe the safe is in the basement, but they haven't checked all the areas.

Wait, in the basement, there's a cabinet and a workbench. The user tried opening the cabinet, which was empty. Maybe there's another cabinet or a different object they can check. Alternatively, maybe the safe is in the basement but requires a key or some action to open. Or perhaps the paper towel is in a different room that they haven't explored yet.

Looking back at the path: they went west from the bathroom, then south, west, north, east, north, west, etc. Maybe they need to check other exits in the current basement. The basement has exits to east, south, west. They came from the attic, so maybe the safe is in the basement but hidden. Alternatively, maybe the workbench has something, but the user tried looking on it and couldn't see anything.

Alternatively, maybe the safe is in the laundry room or another area. But the user hasn't checked all possible exits. The next step might be to check other areas in the basement, like the workbench again, or check the exits to other rooms. Since the user is in the basement, maybe they should check the workbench again or look for other objects. Alternatively, maybe the safe is in the cabinet, but it was empty. Wait, the cabinet was empty, but maybe there's a hidden compartment?

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to find a key or another item to open the safe. But so far, no keys have been found. The user might need to explore more rooms to find the safe or the paper towel. Since the current room is the basement, maybe they should check all possible exits again. The exits are east, south, west.

Okay, let's try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game where they have to navigate through different rooms and eventually recover a paper towel from a safe. The goal is to follow a specific sequence of movements: west, south, west, west, north, east, north, north, west, west, then retrieve the paper towel.

So far, the player has moved through several rooms: Bathroom → Playroom → Vault → Cubicle → Office → Playroom again → Bathroom → Launderette → Studio → Attic → Basement → Bedchamber. They've been moving west and north, but sometimes getting stuck or redirected. 

In the current room, the Bedchamber, the available exits are east, north, and west. The user's last action was "go west," which led them here. The next step in the original plan was to "travel north" after moving east. But in the current room, the player is in the Bedchamber, and the exits are east, north, and west. 

The original instructions said after moving north, then east, then north, then west, then west again. But the player is now in the Bedchamber. Let me check the sequence again. 

Original steps: 
1. Go west
2. Go south
3. Go west
4. Go west
5. Go north
6. Go east
7. Go north
8. Go north
9. Go west
10. Go west
11. Recover paper towel from safe.

Wait, maybe the user is getting confused with the steps. Let me see the current position. The player is in the Bedchamber, which is room 17. The previous rooms were Basement (14), then Attic (12), then Studio (11), Launderette (10), Bathroom (8), Playroom (6), Vault (3), Cubicle (4), Office (5), Playroom (6), etc. 

The user needs to get to the safe where the paper towel is. So far, they haven't found any safe or a place with a safe. The original task mentions a safe, so maybe the safe is in one of the rooms they've passed through. 

In the Attic, there was a chest that was welded shut. In the Basement, there was a cabinet that was empty. The Bedchamber might have something else. But the user hasn't checked the Bedchamber yet. 

The current room is Bedchamber. The exits are east, north, west. The user's next action should be to check the Bedchamber for the safe. But the user hasn't looked around yet. The previous actions were "look on workbench" which didn't work. Maybe they need to look around the Bedchamber. 

But the user's last action was "go west," leading to Bedchamber. Now, the next step is to check if there's a safe here. The user might need to look in the Bedchamber. However, the user's instructions say to only output the command, so the next action should be to look around or check the room. 

Alternatively, maybe the safe is in the basement or attic. But the user hasn't found it yet. The original plan was to go west twice, then recover the paper towel. So perhaps after moving west again from the Bedchamber, they might reach a room with the safe. 

But the user is in the Bedchamber. The exits are east, north, west. The next step could be to go north or west. Let's check the original plan again. After moving west in the Bedchamber, the next step was to go west again. But the user is in the Bedchamber, so going west would take them to another room. 

Wait, the original steps after moving west in the Bedchamber (step 9) was to go west again. So the next action should be to go west from the Bedchamber. But the user is in the Bedchamber, so "go west" would take them to the next room. 

But the user's last action was "go west" to get here. So the next step is to go west again. But the user is in the Bedchamber, and the exit to the west is available. So the next command should be "go west" again. However, the user might need to check the Bedchamber first for the safe. 

But according to the original instructions, after moving west twice, they need to recover the paper towel. So maybe the safe is in the next room after going west from the Bedchamber. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to look for the safe in the current room. But the user hasn't checked the Bedchamber yet. The previous actions in the Bedchamber were just entering, so the next step is to look around. 

But the user's last action was "go west," leading to Bedchamber. Now, the next step is to check the Bedchamber. However, the user's instructions say to only output the command. So the next action should be "look" or "look around," but the user might need to check the room. 

But the user's previous action was "look on workbench," which didn't work. So maybe the user needs to check the Bedchamber's items. 

But the user's next action should be to go west again, as per the original plan. However, the user is in the Bedchamber, and the exit to the west is available. So the next command is "go west." 

But the user is in the Bedchamber, and the exit to the west is unblocked. So the next step is to go west again. That would take them to the next room. 

Therefore, the correct next action is "go west."

GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Sauna =-
You've just sauntered into a sauna.

You make out an opened normal looking safe in the room. The safe contains a paper towel. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting.

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. There is an unblocked exit to the north.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user's goal is to recover the paper towel from the safe and then win. So far, they've navigated through various rooms, including the sauna where the safe is located. The current room is the sauna, and the safe is mentioned here. The user needs to take the paper towel from the safe.

Looking at the previous actions, the user has been moving around different rooms, sometimes getting stuck but generally progressing. In the sauna, the safe is opened and contains the paper towel. The next logical step is to take the paper towel from the safe. The command should be "take paper towel" or something similar. But the game might require specific commands. Since the safe is described as containing the paper towel, the correct action would be to take it. The user hasn't done that yet, so the next action should be to take the paper towel from the safe. Then, after taking it, the game should end with a win. So the correct command here is "take paper towel".
