You are now playing a profound session of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First thing I need you to do is to head west. Then, try to head south. Then, make an effort to move west. Following that, venture west. With that over with, move north. If you can get around to doing that, head east. Okay, and then, make an effort to move north. And then, travel north. After that, head west. Once you do that, try to take a trip west. That done, recover the paper towel from the safe. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Bathroom =-
You've just walked into a bathroom.

You make out a trunk. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see an opened dresser close by. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this?

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game called TextWorld, and their goal is to navigate through different rooms and eventually recover a paper towel from a safe. The current room is an office, and the user has been moving around various rooms like the bathroom, playroom, vault, cubicle, and office.

The user's task is to follow a specific sequence of movements: go west, then south, then west again, then west again, then north, east, north, north, west, west, and finally retrieve the paper towel. So far, the user has moved through several rooms, but they haven't found the paper towel yet.

Looking at the current room, which is the Office, the exits are to the east, north, south, and west. The user needs to continue moving according to the original plan. The next steps in the original instruction were after reaching the Office: go east, then north, then north, then west, then west, then retrieve the paper towel.

But in the current state, the user is in the Office. The next action should be to go east, which they did in the previous step, leading them back to the Playroom. Then, from the Playroom, they need to go south to the Vault again. But the user might be getting stuck in a loop between these rooms. However, the original plan says after the initial movements, they need to go north from the Office, then north again, then west, then west, then get the paper towel.

Wait, the user's last action was going north from the Cubicle to the Office. Now, in the Office, the exits are east, north, south, west. The next step according to the original plan is to go east (which they did, leading to Playroom), then north, then north, then west, then west. But maybe the user needs to check if the paper towel is in the Vault or another room. However, the original instruction says to recover the paper towel from the safe, which might be in a specific location.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to move through the Office to the north, then proceed further. But the Office's north exit is unguarded. So, going north from the Office would take them to another room. Let me check the previous steps.

The user has been moving back and forth between the Vault, Cubicle, Office, Playroom. The original plan requires moving north from the Office, then north again, then west, then west. So, from the Office, going north would take them to a new room. Let's assume that after going north from the Office, they reach a room where the paper towel is located or can be accessed. But in the current state, the user is in the Office, and the next step is to go north. However, the user's last action was going north from the Cubicle to the Office, and now they are in the Office. The next step should be to go north again from the Office. But the Office's north exit is unguarded, so they can go there. Then, from that room, maybe they can find the paper towel or access the safe.

Alternatively, maybe the paper towel is in the Vault, but the Vault's shelf and table are empty. However, the user's task is to recover the paper towel from the safe, so perhaps the safe is in a different room. The user might need to continue moving through the rooms as per the original plan, making sure they follow the sequence correctly. The user has to make sure they don't get stuck in loops and eventually reach the safe where the paper towel is.

So, the next action should be to go north from the Office, as per the original plan. Then, after that, go north again, then west, then west, and then retrieve the paper towel. Therefore, the next command should be "go north".
