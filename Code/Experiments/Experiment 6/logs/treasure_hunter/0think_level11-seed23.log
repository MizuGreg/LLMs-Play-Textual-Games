Welcome to another exciting game of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to move east. Following that, recover the mug from the floor of the cookery. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Bedroom =-
You are in a bedroom. A standard kind of place.

Oh, great. Here's a locker. You see a mantelpiece. The mantelpiece is normal. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You see a recliner. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You see a bar. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Cookery =-
You find yourself in a cookery. An ordinary kind of place. Let's see what's in here.

You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to a cabinet. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The cabinet is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever!

There is an open portal leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a mug on the floor.
