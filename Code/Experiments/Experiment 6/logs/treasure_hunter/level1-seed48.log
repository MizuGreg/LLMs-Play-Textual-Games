I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Pick up the keycard from the floor of the studio.

You are in a studio.



There is an unguarded exit to the east. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

There is a keycard on the floor.
