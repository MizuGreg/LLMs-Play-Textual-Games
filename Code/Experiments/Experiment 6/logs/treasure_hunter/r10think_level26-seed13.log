Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an profound round of TextWorld? You do! Here is how to play! First of all, move east. Once you accomplish that, try to head east. That done, head north. Okay, and then, make an attempt to go to the west. Once you finish that, travel west. If you can get through with that, make an attempt to go west. If you can finish that, try to go west. After that, make an attempt to venture south. And then, travel east. Then, make an effort to move south. If you can do that, go south. With that over with, recover the keycard from the floor of the bar. Got that? Good!

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this TextWorld game and has been moving through different rooms. The goal mentioned earlier was to recover the keycard from the floor of the bar. Let me track their progress.

Starting from the shower, they went east to the salon, then east again to the bedroom, north to the cookery, west to the washroom, east back to cookery, west again to washroom, then east to restroom, west to scullery where they found a key. Then they went east to cookhouse, west back to scullery, and then south to spare room.

In the scullery, they found the key on the floor. The key is probably needed to open the locked chest in the cookhouse or the locked trunk in the spare room. The user is now in the spare room, which has a locked trunk and locker. The key from the scullery might be needed to open those.

The next step would be to use the key on the trunk or locker. But the user's last action was going south to the spare room. The current room has a locked trunk and locker. Since they have the key, they should try to open the trunk first. The command would be to use the key on the trunk. But the system might require a specific command like "open trunk" or "use key on trunk". However, in TextWorld, sometimes the correct command is just "open trunk" if the key is needed. Alternatively, maybe the key is already in inventory, so the user can try opening the trunk.

But the user hasn't mentioned picking up the key yet. Wait, in the scullery, the key was on the floor. So when they were in scullery (room 9), they saw the key. The user's last action was going west to scullery again (room 9), but then they went east to cookhouse (room 10), then west back to scullery (room 9), then south to spare room (room 13). So the key is still in scullery. Wait, no, when they were in scullery (room 9), they saw the key on the floor. So they need to pick it up. But in the previous steps, the user didn't pick it up. So maybe the key is still in scullery, and the user needs to pick it up before trying to open the trunk in the spare room.

Wait, the user is now in the spare room (room 13). The key was in the scullery (room 9). So the user must have gone from scullery to cookhouse, then back to scullery, but didn't pick up the key. So the key is still in scullery. Therefore, the user needs to go back to scullery to pick up the key, then go to the spare room to open the trunk. But the user is currently in the spare room. So the next step is to go back to scullery to pick up the key. But the current room is spare room. The exits from spare room are east, north, south. Wait, in the spare room description, there's an unblocked exit to the east, and north and south are unblocked or unguarded. So the user can go back to scullery by going west (since scullery is west of spare room? Wait, the previous movement was from scullery (room 9) to cookhouse (room 10), then west back to scullery (room 9), then south to spare room (room 13). So the spare room is south of scullery. Therefore, to get back to scullery, the user would need to go north from spare room. But the spare room's exits are east, north, south. So going north from spare room would take them back to scullery. Then, in scullery, they can pick up the key. Then, go back to spare room and open the trunk with the key.

But the user is in the spare room now. The next action should be to go north back to scullery to pick up the key. But the user's last action was going south to spare room. So the next step is to go north to scullery. But the user hasn't picked up the key yet. So the correct next action is to go north to scullery, pick up the key, then return to spare room and open the trunk. However, the user's current room is spare room, and the available exits are east, north, south. So the next command should be "go north" to return to scullery. But the user might not have realized that the key is still there. Alternatively, maybe the key is already in inventory, but that's not the case here. So the correct next step is to go north to scullery, pick up the key, then go back to spare room and open the trunk. But the user hasn't done that yet. Therefore, the next action is "go north".
