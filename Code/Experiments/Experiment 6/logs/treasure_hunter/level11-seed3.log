Welcome to TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, attempt to travel west. Once you accomplish that, pick-up the worm from the floor of the kitchenette. Alright, thanks!

-= Laundromat =-
You are in a laundromat.



There is an unguarded exit to the north. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Kitchenette =-
A well framed board tells you that you are now in the kitchenette.

You smell a sickening smell, and follow it to a saucepan. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

There is a worm on the floor.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in the Kitchenette part of the laundromat. The goal was to first go west, then pick up the worm from the floor of the kitchenette. They already went west, which led them here. Now, the prompt mentions there's a worm on the floor. So the next step should be to pick up the worm.

But wait, the user's last action was "go west", which brought them to the Kitchenette. The current description says there's a worm on the floor. The instruction was to pick up the worm after going west. So the next command should be "take worm" or "pick up worm". However, in TextWorld, the correct command might be "take worm" or "get worm". Let me check the previous messages. The user was told to "pick-up the worm from the floor of the kitchenette." So the correct action here is to pick up the worm. The user needs to do that now. The next action should be "take worm" or "pick up worm". Since the game might use "take", I'll go with that.
