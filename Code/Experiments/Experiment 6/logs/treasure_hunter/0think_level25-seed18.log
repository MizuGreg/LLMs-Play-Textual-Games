Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, you could, like, ensure that the oak door is open. After that, attempt to go north. With that accomplished, make an effort to go to the west. Following that, lift the fresh laundry scented key from the floor of the shower. After you have picked up the fresh laundry scented key, doublecheck that the fresh laundry scented door inside the shower is unlocked. And then, ensure that the fresh laundry scented door inside the shower is open. And then, take a trip north. Then, make an effort to go to the east. Okay, and then, open the portal within the studio. After you have opened the portal, head north. Then, pick-up the latchkey from the floor of the cubicle. Alright, thanks!

-= Closet =-

There is a closed oak door leading north. There is an open wooden gateway leading west.

-= Salon =-
You've entered a salon. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

Hey, want to see a bed stand? Look over there, a bed stand. On the bed stand you make out a fondue. You can see a bench. But the thing is empty. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.
