Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, you could, like, attempt to head north. And then, move north. And then, attempt to go to the west. After that, take the key from the bowl. If you can get your hands on the key, head east. If you can accomplish that, unlock the portal within the pantry. Then, open the portal in the pantry. Then, take a trip north. With that over with, head east. That done, go to the east. Then, try to travel south. And then, go to the south. And then, venture south. That done, recover the latchkey from the floor of the playroom. That's it!

You are in a launderette. An usual one.

You can see a dresser. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a case. The case is empty, what a horrible day! You can see a rack. The rack is typical. The rack appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.
