You are now playing a exciting session of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First of all, make an attempt to travel west. Next, move south. Then, venture west. After that, ensure that the passageway is open. Then, go south. Then, make an attempt to head east. If you can accomplish that, pick up the key from the floor of the closet. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Sauna =-
You've moved into a typical room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be typical. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the sauna.

You make out a board. The board is usual. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. There is an unguarded exit to the south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.
