I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! First thing I need you to do is to go to the east. With that accomplished, make an effort to go east. With that accomplished, travel east. After that, recover the burger from the floor of the study. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Attic =-
You've fallen into an usual room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be usual. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the attic.



There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an unblocked exit to the north.

There is a key on the floor.

You arrive in a restroom. An usual one. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.



There is an open gateway leading east. There is an open hatch leading north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

You can see a locked drawer. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a shelf. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You see a counter. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. This always happens, here in TextWorld!

There is an open gate leading east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

You can see a locked drawer. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a shelf. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You see a counter. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. This always happens, here in TextWorld!

There is an open gate leading east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

-= Steam Room =-
You've entered a steam room. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You can see a locked drawer. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a shelf. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You see a counter. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. This always happens, here in TextWorld!

There is an open gate leading east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

-= Attic =-
You've fallen into an usual room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be usual. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the attic.



There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an unblocked exit to the north.

There is a key on the floor.
