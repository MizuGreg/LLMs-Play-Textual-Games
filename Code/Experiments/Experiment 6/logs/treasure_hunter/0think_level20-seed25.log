It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to travel north. With that done, go north. And then, make an attempt to travel west. After that, take a trip south. With that done, attempt to head west. And then, try to go to the north. After that, make an effort to travel west. If you can get through with that, make an attempt to travel south. If you can finish that, go south. Okay, and then, pick-up the cauliflower from the floor of the study. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Kitchenette =-
You've just shown up in a kitchenette. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."

You see a case. You see an opened fridge. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You see a plate. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

There is an unguarded exit to the north.

Ah, the bathroom. This is some kind of bathroom, really great normal vibes in this place, a wonderful normal atmosphere. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You see an opened safe here. The safe is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever!
