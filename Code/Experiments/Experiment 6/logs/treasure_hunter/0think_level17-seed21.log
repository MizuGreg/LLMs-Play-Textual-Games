It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! First, it would be great if you could make an effort to travel north. Then, ensure that the gateway is open. Then, travel west. Then, move west. After that, attempt to go to the south. That done, move east. And then, pick-up the keycard from the floor of the kitchen. Alright, thanks!

-= Cookhouse =-
If you're wondering why everything seems so ordinary all of a sudden, it's because you've just shown up in the cookhouse.

You see a closed freezer in the room.

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.
