Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, make an attempt to move south. And then, go east. That done, go north. Once you get around to doing that, go east. Then, lift the pear from the floor of the cookery. Got that? Good!

-= Kitchen =-
Well I'll be, you are in the place we're calling the kitchen.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

-= Cellar =-
You find yourself in a cellar. A standard one.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Laundry Place =-
Well, here we are in the laundry place. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.



>                                                                                                                                -= Laundry Place =-0/3

-= Steam Room =-
You've just sauntered into a steam room.



There is an unguarded exit to the east. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a passkey on the floor.


>                                                                                                                                -= Steam Room =-0/4
