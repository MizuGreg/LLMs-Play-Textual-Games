Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First, it would be fantastic if you could take a trip north. Okay, and then, go east. Then, travel south. Next, travel south. After that, lift the stick of butter from the floor of the launderette. Got that? Good!
