Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First thing I need you to do is to venture north. If you can manage that, go west. Next, head south. And then, make an effort to take a trip west. After that, travel west. With that accomplished, head north. Once you succeed at that, try to go east. After that, venture north. And then, head east. After that, attempt to take a trip north. Next, go to the east. Then, recover the keycard from the floor of the bathroom. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Laundromat =-
Of every laundromat you could have sauntered into, you had to walk into an ordinary one.

As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. The counter is usual. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well

There is an unguarded exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

You arrive in an office. A standard one. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

What's that over there? It looks like it's a locker.

You are in a scullery. An usual kind of place. You start to take note of what's in the room.

But there isn't a thing on it. You can see a board. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.
