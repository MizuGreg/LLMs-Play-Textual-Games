I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First thing I need you to do is to make an effort to head north. Then, retrieve the key from the floor of the studio. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Closet =-
Ah, the closet. This is some kind of closet, really great ordinary vibes in this place, a wonderful ordinary atmosphere. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You can see a stand. The stand is normal. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an unguarded exit to the north. There is an unblocked exit to the south. There is an unblocked exit to the west.
