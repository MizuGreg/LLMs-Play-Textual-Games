It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, you could, like, look and see that the walnut gate is wide open. After that, make an attempt to take a trip west. Then, go south. And then, pick-up the latchkey from the floor of the closet. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Bathroom =-
You've come into a typical room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be typical. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the bathroom.

You make out a cabinet. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a drawer. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a trunk.

There is a closed walnut gate leading west. There is an open passageway leading south.

-= Office =-
You've just sauntered into an office.



There is an open walnut gate leading east. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

-= Closet =-
You find yourself in a closet. An ordinary one. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You see a stand. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north.

There is a latchkey on the floor.
