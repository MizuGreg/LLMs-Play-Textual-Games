It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! First thing I need you to do is to make an effort to go west. And then, try to head north. Then, assure that the gate is ajar. Then, make an attempt to venture east. After that, lift the stick of butter from the floor of the cubicle. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Attic =-
Well, here we are in the attic.

You see a safe. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can see a shelf. However, the shelf, like an empty shelf, has nothing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

You arrive in a spare room. A standard kind of place.

You make out a toolbox. The toolbox is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a coffer. Oh, great. Here's a display. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. This always happens!

There is an open portal leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

There is a passkey on the floor.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this TextWorld game, and they've already gone west from the Attic into the Spare Room. The current location is the Spare Room, which has a toolbox, a coffer (but it's just a table), a passkey on the floor, and exits in various directions.

The user's previous action was "go west", which led them to the Spare Room. Now, they're asking if they're making the right actions and if they're close to the goal. The original instructions mentioned exploring west, then north, ensuring the gate is ajar, venturing east, lifting the stick of butter from the cubicle, and then winning.

Looking at the current environment, the user needs to check if they've done the necessary steps. They've gone west (from Attic to Spare Room), which was the first step. Next, they need to go north. The Spare Room has an open portal leading north, so that's a possible direction. The user should try going north next. Also, there's a passkey on the floor. The original goal mentioned lifting the stick of butter from the cubicle, which might be in another area. But the current step is to go north as per the initial instructions.

The user's next action should be to go north. The passkey might be useful later, but the immediate next step is to follow the original plan: go west, then north. So the correct command here is "go north".

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text adventure game, and they've been following a set of instructions to move through different rooms. The goal is to eventually lift the stick of butter from the cubicle and win.

First, they started in the Attic, went west to the Spare Room, then north to the Kitchenette. Now, they're in the Kitchenette. The current description mentions a closed gate leading east, an open portal south, and suggests going west if they need an unblocked exit. The user's next step is to decide whether to go west, south, or maybe check the gate east. But the previous steps were moving west, then north. The original instructions mentioned after going west and north, they needed to assure the gate is ajar, then venture east, then lift the butter.

Wait, in the Kitchenette, there's a closed gate east. The user's previous action was going north, so maybe they need to check that gate. But the instruction says to "assure that the gate is ajar" before going east. So perhaps the user needs to open the gate first. But how? The game might require using an item or a command to open it. However, in the current room, the only thing mentioned is the closed gate east, open portal south, and the suggestion to go west. The user might need to check if there's a way to open the gate. Alternatively, maybe the gate is already ajar, but the user needs to confirm. But the current room's description says the gate is closed. So maybe the next step is to try opening it. But the user's previous actions were moving directions, so maybe the next step is to go east once the gate is open. But since the gate is closed, perhaps the user needs to find a way to open it. However, the user's previous steps didn't mention any keys or items. Wait, in the Spare Room, there was a passkey on the floor. Maybe the user needs to pick that up and use it to open the gate. But the user hasn't picked it up yet. So the next logical step would be to pick up the passkey from the Spare Room, then go east through the gate. But the user is currently in the Kitchenette. Wait, the user's last action was going north from the Spare Room to the Kitchenette. So the passkey was in the Spare Room. So the user needs to go back west to the Spare Room, pick up the passkey, then go east to open the gate. But the current room is Kitchenette, so the user needs to go west back to Spare Room. Then pick up the passkey, then go east to the next room. But the user's next action should be to go west from the Kitchenette to return to the Spare Room. But the user's instruction says to "assure that the gate is ajar" which is the east gate in the Kitchenette. But the gate is closed. So maybe the user needs to go back to the Spare Room, get the passkey, then go east to open the gate. So the next step is to go west from the Kitchenette to the Spare Room. Then pick up the passkey. Then go east to the next room, which would be the room beyond the gate. Then proceed to lift the butter. So the user's next action should be to go west.

You are in a steam room. An usual one. Let's see what's in here.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a box. What a letdown! The box is empty! You see a bench. The bench appears to be empty.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the instructions to navigate through the game. They started by going west, then north, then west again. Now they're in the Steam Room. The next step according to the initial instructions was to "assure that the gate is ajar." But in the current location, the Steam Room, the description mentions a closed gate leading east. Wait, the user's previous action was going west from the Kitchenette, which led them to the Steam Room. Now, in the Steam Room, there's an exit to the east that's unguarded. But the instruction was to check if the gate is ajar. However, the Steam Room's description says there's a closed gate leading east. So maybe the user needs to check if that gate is open. But the current prompt says the exit to the east is unguarded. Hmm, maybe the gate is ajar, but the user needs to confirm. Alternatively, maybe the gate is closed, and they need to open it.

Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game where they have to navigate through different rooms and perform specific actions to win. The original instructions mentioned going west, then north, ensuring the gate is ajar, venturing east, lifting the stick of butter from the cubicle, and then winning.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Kitchenette again after going east from the Steam Room. The previous steps have them moving between rooms: Attic → Spare Room → Kitchenette → Steam Room → Kitchenette. The next step mentioned was to make sure the gate is ajar. In the Kitchenette, there's a closed gate leading east. So maybe the user needs to open that gate. But the current prompt says the gate is closed, so the user needs to find a way to open it. However, the user's next action should be to open the gate leading east. But the system message says to only output the action, like "go north". 

Wait, the user's last action was "go east" from the Steam Room, which led them back to the Kitchenette. Now, in the Kitchenette, the gate east is closed. The original goal was to ensure the gate is ajar. So perhaps the next step is to open that gate. But how? The game might have commands like "open gate east" or something similar. However, the user's previous actions were all "go" commands. Maybe the game expects using "open" as a command. But the initial instructions said to only output the action, like "go north". So maybe the correct action here is to open the gate. But the user's previous actions were moving, so maybe the next step is to open the gate. However, the system message says to only output the action, so the answer should be "open gate east" or similar. But I need to check the possible commands based on the game's context. 

Alternatively, maybe the gate is already ajar, but in the current description, it's listed as closed. So the user needs to open it. The original instruction said to "assure that the gate is ajar", so the next action would be to open it. But the user's previous actions were moving, so perhaps the correct command here is "open gate east". However, the user's previous actions were all "go" commands, so maybe the game expects "open" as a command. But the user's instructions say to only output the action, so the answer should be "open gate east". However, the system might expect a different command. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to find a key or something to open it. But in the Spare Room, there was a passkey on the floor. Maybe the user needs to pick it up and use it. But the current location is Kitchenette, so maybe the passkey is not here. 

Alternatively, maybe the gate is supposed to be opened by moving through it, but it's closed. So the correct action is to open it. Therefore, the next command should be "open gate east".

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Kitchenette again. The previous action was trying to open the gate east, but maybe that's not the right command. The user's goal is to lift the stick of butter from the cubicle and win. So far, they've been moving around the rooms, checking different areas.

In the Steam Room, they found a bench and an exit east. Then they went back to the Kitchenette. Now, the gate east is closed. The user tried to open it, but maybe the correct action is to go through it instead. Wait, the prompt says "open gate east" was the last action, but the system might not recognize that command. Maybe the correct command is "go east" instead. But the gate is closed, so perhaps they need to open it first. However, the user's previous attempt to open the gate might not be valid. Alternatively, maybe there's another object to interact with here. Let me check the current room description again.

In the Kitchenette, there's a closed gate leading east, an open portal south, and the user is told to try going west if they need an unblocked exit. The user's previous action was trying to open the gate east, but maybe the correct action is to go east, and the game will handle the gate. Alternatively, maybe there's a key or item here that can be used to open the gate. Wait, in the Spare Room, there was a passkey on the floor. Maybe that's needed here. But the user hasn't picked it up yet. However, the current room is Kitchenette, so maybe the passkey isn't here. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west to find the passkey. But the user's goal is to get to the cubicle with the butter. Let me think again.

The original instructions said to go west, then north, then ensure the gate is ajar, then east, then lift the butter. So after opening the gate east, maybe the next step is to go through it. But the user tried "open gate east" and the system didn't accept it. Maybe the correct command is "go east" instead. Let me check the previous responses. The user was told in the Kitchenette that the gate is closed, and the exit west is unblocked. So maybe the user should try going west again, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to find the passkey in the Spare Room and use it here. But the user hasn't picked up the passkey yet. Wait, in the Spare Room, there's a passkey on the floor. So maybe the user needs to go back to the Spare Room, pick up the passkey, and then use it to open the gate east. But the user's current location is Kitchenette. So the steps would be: go west to Spare Room, pick up passkey, then go east to open the gate. But the user's last action was trying to open the gate, which might not be possible without the key. Alternatively, maybe the passkey is already here. But in the Kitchenette, there's no mention of a passkey. So perhaps the user needs to go back to the Spare Room, pick up the passkey, then return here to open the gate. But the user is in the Kitchenette now. So the next action should be to go west to the Spare Room, pick up the passkey, then go east to open the gate. However, the user's last action was "open gate east", which might not be valid. So the correct next step is to go west to the Spare Room, pick up the passkey, then go east to open the gate. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next command should be "go west" to return to the Spare Room.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in this TextWorld game. Their goal is to eventually lift the stick of butter from the cubicle and win. So far, they've moved west, north, east, and back west, and tried to open the east gate in the Kitchenette.

Looking at the current room, the Steam Room, the user is here after moving east from the Kitchenette. The Steam Room has a wall that opens to a box (which is empty) and a bench. The exit is to the east, which is unguarded. The user's last action was going west, which took them back to the Steam Room.

The user's next step should be to check if there's anything else in the Steam Room that might be relevant. The box is empty, but maybe there's something else. However, the main goal is to find the stick of butter in the cubicle. The user hasn't mentioned anything about a cubicle yet. Wait, in the initial description, the user was told to "lift the stick of butter from the floor of the cubicle." So maybe the cubicle is in a different room.

The user has been moving between rooms, but hasn't encountered the cubicle yet. The current room is the Steam Room. The exit to the east is unguarded, so maybe going east from here would lead to another room. But the user just came from the Kitchenette, which had a closed gate east. Wait, in the Kitchenette, there's a closed gate leading east and an open portal south. The user tried to open the gate east, but maybe that's a different room.

Alternatively, maybe the cubicle is in the Steam Room? But the Steam Room has a box and a bench, both empty. The user hasn't found the stick of butter yet. So perhaps the next step is to check the bench or the box again, but they're empty. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go back to the Kitchenette and try to go east through the gate they tried to open earlier.

Wait, the user tried to open the gate east in the Kitchenette, but maybe that's not possible. The game might require specific actions to open it. But the user's last action was going west, which brought them back to the Steam Room. So maybe the next step is to check the east exit again, or perhaps look for other items.

Alternatively, maybe the cubicle is in the Spare Room or the Attic. The user hasn't checked those rooms yet. But the initial instructions said to go west, then north, then ensure the gate is ajar, then east, then lift the butter. So maybe the cubicle is in a room that's been passed through but not explored thoroughly.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go back to the Spare Room, check the passkey on the floor, or look for other items. But the user's current location is the Steam Room. The exit to the east is unguarded, so perhaps going east from here is the next step. Let me check the previous steps again.

The user's path so far: Attic (go west) -> Spare Room (go north) -> Kitchenette (go west) -> Steam Room (go east) -> back to Kitchenette (go west). Now, in the Steam Room, the exit is east. So maybe going east from here would take them back to the Kitchenette, but the gate east in the Kitchenette is closed. Wait, but the user tried to open it earlier. Maybe the user needs to open that gate first.

But the user's last action was going west, which brought them back to the Steam Room. The next step would be to check the east exit again. However, the user might need to find the stick of butter in the cubicle, which hasn't been located yet. Maybe the cubicle is in the Spare Room or the Attic. The Attic had a safe and a shelf, but nothing on it. The Spare Room had a toolbox and a passkey. The Kitchenette has a closed gate east. The Steam Room has an empty box and bench.

Hmm. The user's goal is to lift the stick of butter from the cubicle. So maybe the cubicle is in a room that's been passed through but not explored. The user might need to go back to the Spare Room, check the passkey, or look for other items. Alternatively, maybe the cubicle is in the Steam Room, but the user hasn't found it yet. The Steam Room has a bench, but it's empty. The box is empty. So perhaps the user needs to go back to the Kitchenette, try to open the gate east, and proceed further.

But the user's last action was going west, which is back to the Steam Room. The next step would be to go east again, which would take them back to the Kitchenette. Then, perhaps try to open the gate east again. But the user tried that before. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go south from the Kitchenette, as there's an open portal south. But the user hasn't tried that yet.

Wait, in the Kitchenette, the user can go south (open portal), west (back to Steam Room), or east (closed gate). So maybe the user should try going south from the Kitchenette. But the user is currently in the Steam Room. So the next step would be to go east to the Kitchenette again, then go south. But the user's last action was going west, so they're in the Steam Room. So the next action would be to go east to the Kitchenette again. Then, from there, go south. But the user hasn't done that yet.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go back to the Spare Room, check the passkey, or look for other items. But the user hasn't been there since the initial steps. The Spare Room had a passkey on the floor. Maybe that's a clue. But the user hasn't picked it up yet.

Alternatively, the user might need to go back to the Attic, but that's west from the Spare Room. But the user has already been there.

This is a bit confusing. The user's goal is to lift the stick of butter from the cubicle. So perhaps the cubicle is in a room that's not yet explored. The user needs to find it. The current room is the Steam Room, which has no stick of butter. The next step is to go east to the Kitchenette again, then try to open the gate east, or go south from the Kitchenette.

But the user's last action was going west, which is back to the Steam Room. The next step would be to go east again, which would take them back to the Kitchenette. Then, from there, maybe go south. But the user hasn't tried that yet. Alternatively, maybe the cubicle is in the Spare Room or the Attic. But the user hasn't checked those rooms thoroughly.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go back to the Spare Room, pick up the passkey, and use it to open something. The passkey is on the floor in the Spare Room. But the user hasn't been there since the initial steps. So maybe the user needs to go back to the Spare Room, pick up the passkey, and use it to open the gate in the Kitchenette.

But the user's current location is the Steam Room. So the next step would be to go west to the Kitchenette again, then go south. Wait, but the user is in the Steam Room, so going west would take them back to the Kitchenette. Then, from the Kitchenette, go south. But the user hasn't done that yet.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go back to the Spare Room, which is west from the Kitchenette. So from the Steam Room, go west to Kitchenette, then west again to Spare Room. But the user hasn't done that yet.

This is getting complicated. The user's next action should be to go east from the Steam Room to the Kitchenette again, then try to open the gate east. But the user tried that before. Alternatively, go south from the Kitchenette. But the user hasn't tried that yet.

Wait, in the Kitchenette, the user can go south through an open portal. So from the Kitchenette, going south would be the next step. But the user is in the Steam Room. So the next action would be to go east to the Kitchenette, then south. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next step is to go east from the Steam Room to the Kitchenette again, then south. But the user's last action was going west, so they're in the Steam Room. The next action would be to go east to the Kitchenette.

-= Kitchenette =-
You are in a kitchenette. An usual kind of place.



There is a closed gate leading east. There is an open portal leading south. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

Okay, let's try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game where they have to navigate through different rooms and perform specific actions to win. The goal mentioned in the initial prompt was to go west, then north, ensure the gate is ajar, venture east, lift the stick of butter from the cubicle, and then win.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Kitchenette again, which has a closed gate leading east and an open portal south. The previous actions involved moving west and east between rooms, but the gate east remains closed. The user tried opening the gate east, but maybe that's not the right step now.

Wait, the original plan was to go west, then north, check the gate, then east, then lift the butter. The current room is Kitchenette, and the user is stuck in a loop between Kitchenette and Steam Room. The gate east is closed, so maybe the next step is to find a way to open it. But the user tried "open gate east" earlier, which might not be the correct command. Maybe the game expects a different action, like using an item or finding a key.

Looking back, in the Spare Room, there was a passkey on the floor. Maybe that's needed to open the gate. The user hasn't picked it up yet. So the next step might be to pick up the passkey, then use it to open the gate east. But the current room is Kitchenette, so the passkey might be in another room. Wait, the passkey was in the Spare Room. So the user needs to go back to the Spare Room to pick it up.

But the user is currently in the Kitchenette. The exit to the west leads back to the Steam Room, then to the Kitchenette again. So maybe the user needs to go west to Steam Room, then east again to Kitchenette, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe the passkey is in the Steam Room? Wait, in the Steam Room, there's a box that's empty and a bench. Maybe the passkey is there? But the user hasn't checked that yet.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go south from Kitchenette, which is open. Going south would lead to another room. Let me check the previous steps. The user was in the Steam Room, then went east to Kitchenette. In the Kitchenette, the open portal leads south. So going south from Kitchenette would take the user to a new room. Maybe that's where the passkey is located. But the user hasn't tried that yet.

So the next action should be to go south from Kitchenette. That would be the next step. Let me check the previous messages. The user was in Kitchenette, and the options were to go west, south, or east. The user tried going west again, but maybe going south is the right move. So the correct next action is to go south.

-= Spare Room =-
You arrive in a spare room. A standard kind of place.

You make out a toolbox. The toolbox is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a coffer. Oh, great. Here's a display. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. This always happens!

There is an open portal leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

There is a passkey on the floor.

Okay, let's break down the user's problem. They're playing a text-based game where they need to follow specific steps to win. The user has been moving through different rooms, opening gates, and interacting with objects. The goal mentioned in the initial instructions was to go west, then north, ensure the gate is ajar, venture east, lift the stick of butter from the cubicle, and then win.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Spare Room again after moving south from the Kitchenette. The Spare Room has a passkey on the floor. The previous steps included going west, north, east, and trying to open the east gate. Now, the user is at the Spare Room, and the passkey is present. 

The next logical step would be to pick up the passkey since it's mentioned as being on the floor. The passkey might be necessary to proceed further, especially since the user needs to ensure the gate is ajar. In the initial instructions, after going west, north, and ensuring the gate is open, they needed to venture east. The passkey could be a crucial item for opening the gate or accessing the next area.

The user's previous actions have been moving between rooms and trying to open gates. The passkey is now in the Spare Room, so picking it up would be the next step. After that, the user might need to use the passkey to open the gate leading east, which was previously closed. This would align with the original goal of ensuring the gate is ajar and proceeding east. 

Therefore, the correct action here is to pick up the passkey. The user should take the passkey from the floor in the Spare Room to continue towards the next step in the game.
