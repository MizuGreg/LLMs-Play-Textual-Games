Welcome to another fast paced episode of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First stop, attempt to head north. After that, go east. After that, unlock the lavender scented chest in the sauna. And then, assure that the lavender scented chest is wide open. And then, retrieve the paper towel from the lavender scented chest. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Restroom =-
You are in a restroom. A standard kind of place. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.

>                                                                                                                                -= Restroom =-0/1
AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go north
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Cellar =-
I never took you for the sort of person who would show up in a cellar, but I guess I was wrong. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a counter. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the counter.

There is an open door leading east. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go east
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Sauna =-
You have moved into a sauna. Not the sauna you'd expect. No, this is a sauna.

You make out a safe. What a letdown! The safe is empty! You make out a locked lavender scented chest. You see a shelf. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. What's the point of an empty shelf?

There is an open door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unblocked exit to the south.
