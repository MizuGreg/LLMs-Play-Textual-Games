Welcome to TextWorld! Here is how to play! First, it would be a great idea if you could make an attempt to head east. Okay, and then, go to the north. Okay, and then, go to the north. If you can finish that, make an effort to take a trip east. And then, pick up the latchkey from the pan. Got that? Good!

-= Laundry Place =-
You have walked into a laundry place. Not the laundry place you'd expect. No, this is a laundry place. You begin looking for stuff.

You can see an opened cabinet, which looks ordinary, in the corner. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You make out a table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

There is an open portal leading east. There is an open hatch leading north.

-= Bedroom =-
Guess what, you are in a place we're calling a bedroom. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.



There is an open gate leading north. There is an open portal leading west.

There is a loaf of bread on the floor.

-= Bathroom =-
You find yourself in a bathroom. A standard kind of place.

Were you looking for a board? Because look over there, it's a board. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is an open gateway leading north. There is an open gate leading south.

-= Cubicle =-
I am sorry to announce that you are now in the cubicle.

You see a coffer. You make out an opened trunk. The trunk is empty! What a waste of a day!

There is an open gateway leading south. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east.



>                                                                                                                                -= Cubicle =-0/4

-= Cookhouse =-
Wow! You're in a cookhouse. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You make out a pan. The pan is ordinary. On the pan you see a latchkey. You scan the room, seeing a bowl. However, the bowl, like an empty bowl, has nothing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the bowl.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.



>                                                                                                                                -= Cookhouse =-0/5
