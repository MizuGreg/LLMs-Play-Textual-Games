Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is in a text-based game where their goal is to lift the nest of bugs from the floor of the office. The environment seems to be a series of rooms connected by exits, and the player is moving between them.

Looking at the history of commands, the player has been moving east and west between the Canteen and Chamber rooms. The exits mentioned are east and south in the Canteen, and west in the Chamber. The player keeps going east from the Canteen, which leads back to the Chamber, and then west again, which loops back. This suggests that the player is stuck in a loop between these two rooms.

The original goal was to reach the office's floor where the bug nest is. The first room the player entered was the Office, then they went east to the Cellar, then north to the Canteen, and then back and forth between Canteen and Chamber. But the bug nest is still in the Office, which the player hasn't returned to yet. 

Wait, the initial description said that the Office had the nest of bugs. The player left the Office by going east to the Cellar. Now, the player is stuck in a loop between Canteen and Chamber. To reach the Office again, they need to find a way back. The exits in the Canteen are east and south. The player was going east from Canteen, which leads to Chamber, and west leads back to Canteen. But the exit to the south from Canteen might be a way back to the Office. However, in the previous steps, when the player was in the Canteen, they went east (to Chamber) and then west back to Canteen. But the exit to the south was mentioned as unblocked. Maybe the player needs to go south from Canteen to return to the Office.

Wait, the first move was from Office to Cellar (east). Then from Cellar, the player went north to Canteen. Now, in the Canteen, the exits are east (Chamber) and south. If the player goes south from Canteen, they might return to the Cellar, then from Cellar, go west back to Office. But the player hasn't tried that yet. The current loop is between Canteen and Chamber, but the player needs to go south from Canteen to get back to the Cellar, then west to the Office.

But in the previous steps, the player kept going east and west, not taking the south exit. So the next logical step would be to go south from Canteen to exit back to Cellar, then west to Office. But the user's last action was going east again, leading back to Chamber. So the player needs to break the loop and take the south exit from Canteen to get back to the Cellar, then find the way back to the Office.

Alternatively, maybe the Office is connected to the Cellar via another exit. The Cellar had an unblocked exit to the north (Canteen) and east. Wait, in the Cellar description, the user was told to try going east or west. But the player went north to Canteen. Maybe the exit to the east in the Cellar is the way back to the Office? Wait, the initial move was from Office to Cellar east. So the Cellar's east exit would be back to the Office. But the player was in the Cellar, then went north to Canteen. So if the player goes east from Cellar, they would return to the Office. But the player hasn't been in the Cellar since the first move. So maybe the player needs to go back from Canteen south to Cellar, then east to Office.

But the current position is in the Canteen, and the exits are east (Chamber) and south. So the correct next step would be to go south from Canteen to Cellar, then east to Office. However, the player has been stuck in the loop, so the next action should be to go south from Canteen to break the loop and return to the Office.
