Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. Your first objective is to make an effort to go east. After that, attempt to go to the north. Then, make an effort to head north. And then, attempt to take a trip west. And then, travel north. And then, head east. With that done, go east. And then, make an attempt to take a trip east. And then, attempt to go to the south. And then, go to the south. Then, make an effort to head west. Next, lift the gummy bear from the floor of the chamber. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Cubicle =-
You are in a cubicle. A typical kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

An open typical looking coffer is right there by you. The coffer is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You see a cabinet. You can see a chair. The chair is ordinary. However, the chair, like an empty chair, has nothing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You can see a bookshelf. The bookshelf is normal. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. This always happens! You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to a stand. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

You find yourself in a launderette. A typical one. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

You can make out a shelf. The shelf is normal. But the thing is empty.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text adventure game, and they've been given a series of directional commands to follow. The initial goal was to go east, then north, then north again, west, north, east, east again, south, south, west, pick up the gummy bear, and then win.

So far, the user started by going east from the cubicle, which led them to the launderette. Now, in the launderette, the available exits are east, north, and west. The next step in the original plan was to go north after east. But the user is asking if they're on the right track and what their next action should be.

Looking at the sequence: after the first east, the next instruction was to attempt to go north. The launderette has a north exit that's unguarded, so that should be possible. The user's next move should be to go north. But the user is asking if they're close, so maybe they need confirmation. However, the instructions say to only output the action, so the answer should be "go north" again. Wait, but in the current room (launderette), the user can go north. So the next step is to go north as per the original plan. The user's next action should be "go north".

You can see an opened chest. What a letdown! The chest is empty! Hey, want to see a bowl? Look over there, a bowl. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what the user is asking here. They provided a series of text-based game scenes where the player is moving between different rooms: a cubicle, a launderette, a canteen, and so on. The original goal was to follow a specific sequence of movements and then pick up a gummy bear.

First, I need to check the user's current position. The last scene they're in is the Canteen. The user has been moving east, north, and now they're in the Canteen. The next steps in the original goal were to go east, then north, then west, north, east, east, south, south, west, then pick up the gummy bear.

Looking at the Canteen scene, the exits are east, north, south, and west. The user's next action should be to go east again, as per the original plan. But wait, the user's previous actions were go east, go north, and now they're in the Canteen. The original instructions said after going north in the canteen, they should travel north again. But the Canteen has a north exit. So maybe the next step is to go north from the Canteen. However, the user's original plan after the canteen was to go east, then north, then west, etc. Wait, let me recheck the original goal.

Original goal steps: go east, then north, then north again, then west, then north, then east, then east, then south, then south, then west, then pick up the gummy bear. So after the canteen, the next step was to go north. But in the Canteen, the user can go north. So the next action should be go north. But the user's last action was go north to get to the Canteen. Wait, maybe I need to track the steps again.

Wait, the initial instructions were: first objective is to make an effort to go east. Then attempt to go north. Then make an effort to head north. Then attempt to take a trip west. Then travel north. Then head east. With that done, go east. Then attempt to take a trip east. Then attempt to go to the south. Then go to the south. Then make an effort to head west. Next, lift the gummy bear.

So the sequence is: east, north, north, west, north, east, east, south, south, west, then pick up gummy bear.

So after the Canteen, the next step would be going north again. But in the Canteen, the user is already in the Canteen. The exits are north, south, east, west. So the next step after arriving in the Canteen would be to go north again. But the user's last action was going north to get to the Canteen. Wait, maybe the user is in the Canteen and needs to go north again. But the original plan says after the canteen, go north. So the next action is go north. However, the user's previous action was go north to get to the Canteen. So perhaps the next step is to go north again from the Canteen. But the user's current position is the Canteen. So the next action should be go north. But the user's last action was go north to get to the Canteen. Wait, maybe the user is in the Canteen and needs to go north again. Let me check the current scene again.

In the Canteen scene, the exits are north, east, south, west. So the user can go north again. So the next action should be go north. But the user's original plan after the Canteen was to go north. So the answer should be go north. But the user's previous action was go north to get to the Canteen. So the next step is to go north again. But the user's current position is the Canteen, so the next action is go north. However, the user might have already done that. Wait, the user's last action was go north to get to the Canteen. So the next step in the original plan is to go north again. But the user is in the Canteen, so the next action is go north. But the user's next action is to go north again. But the user's current position is the Canteen. So the next action is go north. But the user's previous action was go north to get to the Canteen. So maybe the next step is to go north again. But the user's original plan says after the Canteen, go north. So the answer is go north.

-= Dish-Pit =-
You arrive in a dish-pit. A typical kind of place.

You can see a plate. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the south. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following a series of directions to move in different directions: east, north, east, north, west, south, etc. The goal was to eventually lift the gummy bear and win.

So far, the user has moved from the Cubicle to the Launderette, then to the Canteen, and then to the Dish-Pit. Each time, they've been going north or east as per the initial instructions. Now, in the Dish-Pit, the exits are east, north, south, and west. The next step in the original plan was to travel west after going north. But the user's last action was going north again. Wait, the original instructions said after going north, attempt to take a trip west. So maybe the next step is to go west from the Dish-Pit. But the user's last action was go north, leading to the Dish-Pit. Now, the next step according to the original plan was to go west. But the user hasn't done that yet. However, the current location is Dish-Pit, and the exits include west. So the next action should be to go west. But the user's previous action was go north, so maybe the next step is to go west. Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go east again. Wait, the original instructions said after going north, attempt to take a trip west. So from the Canteen, they went north to Dish-Pit. Then, the next step is to go west. So the next command should be go west. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the answer should be go west.

-= Office =-
You've entered an office. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You can make out a locked bureau nearby.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the south.



>                                                                                                                                -= Office =-0/5

Okay, let's see. The user has been following a series of directions to move in different directions: east, north, north, west, north, east, east, south, south, west, and then lift the gummy bear. So far, they've been moving through different rooms like the cubicle, launderette, canteen, dish-pit, and office.

Now, the current room is the Office. The next step in the original goal was to "make an effort to head west" after going south. But in the current room, the exits are east, north, and south. The user's last action was going west from the dish-pit to the office. Now, they need to go south from the office. The next step in the original instructions was to go south, then go to the south again, then west, then lift the gummy bear.

Wait, the original goal mentioned after going east, north, north, west, north, east, east, south, south, west, then lift the gummy bear. So after the office, the next direction should be south. The office has an unblocked exit to the south. So the next action should be go south. Then, after that, they need to go west again. But first, the immediate next step is south.

So the correct command here is "go south".

-= Bar =-
You've entered a bar.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following a sequence of directions to move around different rooms in the TextWorld game. The original goal was to go east, then north, then north again, west, north, east, east again, south, south, west, pick up the gummy bear, and then win.

So far, the user has moved through the Cubicle, Launderette, Canteen, Dish-Pit, Office, and Bar. The current location is the Bar. The next steps in the original plan after the Bar would be to go south again, then west, then pick up the gummy bear.

In the Bar's description, there's an exit to the north and east, and a suggestion to go south. The user's last action was going south from the Bar, but the response says "You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south." Wait, maybe there's a confusion here. The user is at the Bar, and the exits are east (unguarded), north (unguarded), and south (unblocked). The user's next move should be to go south as per the original plan. But the user's last action was going south, which might have led them to the next room. However, the current prompt shows they are in the Bar, and the next action is to go south again. Wait, maybe the user is supposed to go south from the Bar to reach the next room, then proceed to the west as per the original plan.

But the original plan after the Bar would be to go south, then west. So the next action should be to go south from the Bar. But the user's last action was going south, which might have led them to the next room. However, the current prompt shows they are still in the Bar. Wait, maybe the user is at the Bar and needs to go south again. Let me check the original steps again.

Original steps: After the Bar, the next step is to go south. Then, go west. Then lift the gummy bear. So from the Bar, going south would take them to the next room, then west from there. But the user's last action was going south, which might have led them to the next room. However, the current prompt shows they are in the Bar, so maybe the user needs to go south again. Wait, perhaps the user is at the Bar and needs to go south again. But the original plan says after the Bar, go south, then west. So the next action should be to go south from the Bar. But the user's last action was going south, which might have led them to the next room. However, the current prompt shows they are still in the Bar. Maybe the user is supposed to go south again, but the Bar's description says there's an unblocked exit to the south. So the next action is to go south again.

Alternatively, maybe the user is at the Bar and needs to go south again. But the original plan says after the Bar, go south, then west. So the next action is to go south from the Bar. Therefore, the correct next action is to go south.

Okay, let's see. The user has been moving through different rooms in the game, following a specific sequence of directions. The original goal was to go east, then north, then north again, west, north, east, east, south, south, west, and then pick up the gummy bear.

So far, the user has gone through Cubicle → Launderette → Canteen → Dish-Pit → Office → Bar → Cubicle again. Now, they're back in the Cubicle. The next steps in the original plan after returning to Cubicle would be to try to lift the gummy bear from the floor. But in the current description of the Cubicle, there's no mention of a gummy bear. The stand is empty, and all the furniture is empty. Wait, maybe the gummy bear is in a different location? Or maybe it's in the office or another room?

But according to the user's previous steps, they have to go east again. The current room is Cubicle, which has an exit to the east. So the next action should be to go east again. The user's next move is to go east, which would take them back to the Launderette. But the original goal was to go east, then north, etc. So maybe the user is supposed to keep moving in the specified directions, even if they loop back. However, the final step is to pick up the gummy bear. Since the current room (Cubicle) doesn't mention the gummy bear, perhaps the user needs to check other rooms.

But the user's next action, according to the original plan, is to "make an effort to go east" again. So the correct next command is to go east. The user is following the sequence as instructed, so even though they're back in the Cubicle, the next step is to go east again. The gummy bear might be in a different room, but the user hasn't reached that yet. So the next action is go east.

Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text adventure game, and their goal is to follow a specific sequence of movements and actions. The original instructions were to go east, then north, then north again, west, north, east, east, south, south, west, lift the gummy bear, and then win.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Launderette again, which is room 0/8. The previous steps have them moving through different rooms: Cubicle, Launderette, Canteen, Dish-Pit, Office, Bar, back to Cubicle, Launderette again. The next steps in the original plan after the first few moves would be to attempt to take a trip east again, then south, etc. But the user is now in the Launderette, and the next action in the sequence is to go east again. However, the user's last action was "go east" which led them back to the Launderette. The current prompt says to think about whether they're on the right track and then give the next command.

But the user's original goal is to eventually lift the gummy bear. So far, the user hasn't found any gummy bear. The gummy bear is mentioned in the original instructions as something to lift from the floor of the chamber. However, in the rooms described so far, there's no mention of a gummy bear. The user has been moving through rooms that are empty, with empty chests, shelves, etc. Maybe the gummy bear is in a different room that hasn't been explored yet.

The user's current position is the Launderette. The exits here are east, north, and west. The original plan after the first few moves was to go east, then south, etc. But the user is repeating rooms, which might indicate that they're not following the correct path. However, the game's rooms might be connected in a loop, so maybe the user is just moving through the same areas.

The next step according to the original plan after the Launderette is to attempt to go east again. But the user is already in the Launderette, and the next action in the sequence is to go east again. However, the user's last action was "go east" which brought them back to the Launderette. The current prompt says to think about whether they're on the right track. Since the user hasn't found the gummy bear yet, maybe they need to explore other rooms. But the instructions say to follow the sequence of movements, so perhaps the user is supposed to continue moving east, north, etc., even if they loop.

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go west from the Launderette, as the exit to the west is unblocked. But according to the original plan, after going east, the next steps are to go south, then south again, then west. However, the user is in the Launderette, and the exits are east, north, west. So maybe the next step is to go west, then proceed to the next room.

But the user's original plan after the first few moves was to go east, then south, then south, then west, then north, etc. So perhaps the user needs to go west from the Launderette. However, the user's last action was "go east", which led them back to the Launderette. The next step in the sequence is to go east again, but that might not be the right path. Alternatively, maybe the user should go west from the Launderette to proceed further.

But the user's instructions say to follow the sequence: after going east, attempt to go to the north, then north again, west, north, east, east, south, south, west, then lift the gummy bear. So after the initial east, the next steps are north, north, west, north, east, east, south, south, west. So in the current state, the user is in the Launderette, and the next step in the sequence is to go north. But the user's last action was "go east", which brought them back to the Launderette. The next step in the sequence would be to go north from the Launderette. However, the user's current position is the Launderette, and the exit to the north is unguarded. So the next action should be "go north".

But the user's previous action was "go east", and the current room is the Launderette. The next step in the sequence is to go north. So the correct next action is "go north".

You can see an opened chest. What a letdown! The chest is empty! Hey, want to see a bowl? Look over there, a bowl. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user has been moving through different rooms in the game, following a specific sequence of directions. The original goal was to go east, then north, then north again, west, north, east, east, south, south, west, lift the gummy bear, and then win.

So far, the user has cycled through Cubicle → Launderette → Canteen → Dish-Pit → Office → Bar → Cubicle → Launderette → Canteen. They're back in the Canteen again, which is step 9. The next steps in the original plan after step 9 (which was "travel north") would be to head east again. But in the current room (Canteen), the available exits are east, north, south, west. The user's next action should be to go east, as per the original plan. However, the user might be getting stuck in a loop. But according to the instructions, they need to continue following the sequence. The next step after step 9 (travel north) was to go east, but in the Canteen, going east is unblocked. So the next command should be "go east". But wait, the user's previous action was "go north" to get to Canteen again. The original plan after step 9 (travel north) was to head east. So the next step is to go east from the Canteen. Let me check the current room's exits again. In the Canteen, the exits are east, north, south, west. So "go east" is valid. Therefore, the next action is "go east".

-= Chamber =-
You've entered a chamber.

You make out a locker!

So far, the user has been moving east, north, north, west, south, south, east, and now they're in the Chamber. The Chamber has a gummy bear on the floor. The next step according to the original plan was to lift the gummy bear. The user's last action was "go east", which led them to the Chamber. Now, they need to pick up the gummy bear. The command for that would be "take gummy bear" or "lift gummy bear". But the game's previous commands were all "go [direction]", so maybe the correct command here is "take gummy bear". However, the user's previous actions were all movement commands, so they might need to use the correct verb here. The instruction says to "lift the gummy bear from the floor of the chamber" once you've done that, you win. So the next action should be to take the gummy bear. The correct command would be "take gummy bear" or "lift gummy bear". Since the game's previous commands were "go", maybe "take" is the right verb here. So the next action is "take gummy bear".
