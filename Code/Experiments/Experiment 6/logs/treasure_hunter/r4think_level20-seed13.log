Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First off, go west. Okay, and then, move south. Then, move west. With that done, go north. Once you manage that, make an attempt to go north. That done, venture east. And then, head north. After that, go to the west. With that done, look and see that the trunk within the attic is wide open. After pulling open the trunk, pick up the keycard from the trunk. And once you've done that, you win!

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of directions to navigate through different rooms and eventually find a keycard in an attic trunk. So far, they've gone west, south, west, north, north, and now they're in the Scullery. The next step according to the original instructions was to venture east and then head north. But the user is now asking if they're on the right track and if they're close to the goal.

Looking at the current room, the Scullery, the available exits are east, north, and south. The original plan was to go east from the Chamber (which was the previous room) and then north. Wait, the user's last action was going north from the Chamber to the Scullery. So maybe the next step is to go east from the Scullery. The original instructions said after going north from the Chamber, venture east and then north. But the user is now in the Scullery. Let me check the original steps again.

Original steps: After the initial movements (west, south, west, north, north), the next was to "venture east. And then, head north." So from the Scullery, the user should go east, then north. But in the Scullery, the exits are east, north, and south. So going east would be the next step. Then from the east exit, maybe they'd reach the attic? Or another room. The goal is to find the trunk in the attic. So the user needs to proceed east from the Scullery, then north to reach the attic. But the user is asking if they're close. The current room is Scullery, and the next step should be east. So the correct command here is "go east".

Okay, let's recap the user's journey so far. They started in a bar, went west to a laundromat, then south to a canteen, west to a closet, north to a chamber, then north again to a scullery. From there, they went east to a studio, north to a cookhouse, and then east again to a kitchen. The original goal was to navigate through various rooms, eventually reaching an attic where a trunk is open and retrieve a keycard.

Looking at the current room, the Kitchen, the user is told to go west. The previous steps involved moving in a pattern of west, south, west, north, north, east, north, east. The next step here is to go west from the kitchen. But wait, the user is in the kitchen, and the instruction says to go west. However, the user is asking if they're close to the goal. The keycard is in the attic trunk, so they need to find the attic. The previous rooms included a studio, cookhouse, kitchen. The next logical step would be to check if the attic is nearby. But according to the current room's description, the exit is west. So going west from the kitchen would take them back to the cookhouse or another room. But the user needs to reach the attic. Maybe the attic is connected through another path. Alternatively, perhaps the user needs to check the studio or cookhouse for a way to the attic. However, in the cookhouse, there's a closed chest. Maybe that's where the keycard is, but the user needs to open it. But the original instruction was to go to the attic and pull open the trunk. So perhaps the user is missing a step here. But according to the current path, the next action is to go west from the kitchen. So the correct command here is "go west".

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Cookhouse and Kitchen. They've been going back and forth between these two rooms. The original goal was to reach the attic and find the keycard. So far, the user hasn't reached the attic yet. The path they've taken so far includes several rooms like the bar, laundromat, canteen, closet, chamber, scullery, studio, cookhouse, and kitchen. The next step should be to find a way to the attic. But in the current setup, the exits from the Cookhouse are east, south, and west. The Kitchen has exits west and east. Maybe the user needs to check the closed chest in the Cookhouse. The original instruction mentioned a trunk in the attic, but maybe the chest here is a clue. However, the user hasn't opened it yet. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to find another path. But according to the previous steps, the user was supposed to go east from the Scullery, then north to the Studio, then north to the Cookhouse, then east to the Kitchen, then west back to the Cookhouse. This loop suggests that the user might be missing a different path. Perhaps the attic is connected through another room. But based on the current room descriptions, the user hasn't found the attic yet. The next possible action is to check the closed chest in the Cookhouse, but the user hasn't interacted with it. However, the original instructions didn't mention opening chests, only pulling open a trunk in the attic. So maybe the user needs to continue moving until they reach the attic. But how? The current path isn't leading there. Maybe the user needs to go south from the Cookhouse. The exit to the south is unguarded. Let me check the previous steps. The user was in the Cookhouse, and the exit to the south is unguarded. So maybe going south from the Cookhouse would lead to another room. But in the previous steps, when the user was in the Cookhouse, the exit to the south was mentioned. So the next action should be to go south from the Cookhouse. But the user is currently in the Cookhouse again after going west and east. So the correct next step is to go south.

Okay, let's recap. The user's goal was to navigate through various rooms, eventually reaching the attic where a trunk is open and retrieving a keycard. They've been moving around different rooms like the bar, laundromat, canteen, closet, chamber, scullery, studio, cookhouse, kitchen, and back to the scullery. Finally, they reached the attic, found the trunk, and now they're back in the scullery.

The current room is the Scullery, and the user is asked if they're close to the goal. The original plan was to go to the attic, open the trunk, and pick up the keycard. The user has already been in the attic (step 15) and saw the trunk. However, they didn't pick up the keycard yet. The next step should be to go back to the attic, open the trunk, and retrieve the keycard. But in the current setup, after going south from the attic (step 15), they're back in the scullery (step 16). So the next action should be to go north again to return to the attic. Once there, they can interact with the trunk. The user needs to go north from the scullery to the attic again, then open the trunk. The correct command here is "go north" to reach the attic once more and then proceed to open the trunk.
