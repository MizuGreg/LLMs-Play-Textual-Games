Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game called TextWorld, and they've been moving through different rooms. The original instructions mentioned a series of directions: go south, east, south, west, south, west, north, east, north, west, etc. The goal was to pick up a paper towel from a safe in the sauna.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Bedchamber. The room description says there's an unblocked exit to the east and a suggestion to go north or west. The user's previous actions have been following the initial directions, but they might have gotten stuck in a loop between the Basement, Attic, and Bedchamber.

The user is asking if they're on the right track and if they're close to the goal. The key here is to check if the paper towel in the sauna has been mentioned in the rooms they've visited. So far, the rooms visited are Attic, Lounge, Launderette, Bathroom, Study, Basement, and Bedchamber. The sauna hasn't been mentioned yet, so maybe the next step is to find the sauna.

But according to the initial directions, after moving west from the Bedchamber, the next step was to go north, but that's blocked. The user might need to find another path. Alternatively, maybe the sauna is in a room they haven't explored yet. Since the user is in the Bedchamber, perhaps the exit to the east leads to the sauna. The user should try going east to check.

Alternatively, maybe the safe in the sauna is in a room that's been visited but not mentioned. However, based on the current room descriptions, the sauna hasn't been encountered yet. The user needs to proceed to the sauna to pick up the paper towel. The next logical step would be to go east from the Bedchamber, as that's the unblocked exit mentioned.

Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Spare Room and the Dish-Pit. They keep going back and forth between these two rooms. The original goal was to pick up the paper towel from the safe in the sauna. So far, the user hasn't encountered the sauna yet. The current path seems to be going in circles without reaching the sauna.

The user is asking if they're on the right track. The answer is no because they haven't found the sauna. The correct approach would be to find a way to get to the sauna. Maybe the sauna is in a different part of the map that hasn't been explored yet. The user needs to find a new path that leads to the sauna instead of looping between the Spare Room and Dish-Pit.

Looking at the room descriptions, the Dish-Pit has an unguarded exit to the east, and the Spare Room has an exit to the south. Maybe the user should try going south from the Spare Room. The exit to the south is unblocked, so that's a possible direction. Alternatively, maybe the sauna is connected to another room that's not been visited yet. The user needs to break the cycle and explore new areas. The next step should be to go south from the Spare Room to see if that leads to the sauna.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Spare Room and the Dish-Pit. They keep going back and forth between these two rooms. The original goal was to pick up the paper towel from the safe in the sauna. So far, the user hasn't encountered the sauna yet. The current path seems to be going in circles without reaching the sauna.

The user is asking if they're on the right track. The answer is no because they haven't found the sauna. The correct approach would be to find a way to get to the sauna. Maybe the sauna is in a different part of the map that hasn't been explored yet. The user needs to find a new path that leads to the sauna instead of looping between the Spare Room and Dish-Pit.

Looking at the room descriptions, the Dish-Pit has an unguarded exit to the east, and the Spare Room has an exit to the south. Maybe the user should try going south from the Spare Room. The exit to the south is unblocked, so that's a possible direction. Alternatively, maybe the sauna is connected to another room that's not been visited yet. The user needs to break the cycle and explore new areas. The next step should be to go south from the Spare Room to see if that leads to the sauna.
