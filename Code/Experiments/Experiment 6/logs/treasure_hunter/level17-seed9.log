I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! First step, make an attempt to take a trip west. And then, go to the south. Okay, and then, open the passageway. And then, go south. And then, travel west. And then, attempt to venture north. Then, retrieve the poem from the floor of the bedchamber. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Studio =-
You are in an usual kind of place. That is to say, you're in a studio.

You can make out a stand. The stand is normal. However, the stand, like an empty stand, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is an open gateway leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.
