I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First stop, head north. And then, attempt to travel north. And then, go to the west. Then, take a trip west. And then, recover the printer from the chair in the cubicle. That's it!

-= Vault =-
You're now in a vault.

You see a shelf. The shelf is ordinary. But the thing is empty.

You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.
