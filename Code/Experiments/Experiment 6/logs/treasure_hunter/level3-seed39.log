I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! First thing I need you to do is to attempt to take a trip east. And then, pick up the candy bar from the floor of the cubicle. Alright, thanks!

-= Bedchamber =-
You are in a bedchamber. An ordinary one.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

-= Cubicle =-
You make a grand eccentric entrance into a cubicle.



There is an unblocked exit to the west.

There is a candy bar and a Quote of the Day Calendar on the floor.
