Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to make an effort to go west. Then, take a trip north. After that, head west. Okay, and then, try to head south. After that, pick-up the teaspoon from the floor of the cookhouse. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Cubicle =-
This might come as a shock to you, but you've just stumbled into a cubicle.

You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.
