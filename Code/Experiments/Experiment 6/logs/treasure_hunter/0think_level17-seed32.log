Welcome to another exciting episode of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to make sure that the hatch inside the bathroom is ajar. Then, make an effort to move south. And then, ensure that the gateway is open. After that, make an effort to move south. Then, venture west. And then, attempt to travel south. Then, take the key from the rack in the canteen. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Bathroom =-
You find yourself in a bathroom. An ordinary one.



There is a closed hatch leading south. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Workshop =-
You've walked into a normal room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be normal. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the workshop. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.



There is an open gateway leading north. There is an open passageway leading west. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. There is an unblocked exit to the south.



>                                                                                                                                -= Workshop =-0/6

You make out a locked standard looking trunk right there by you.

>                                                                                                                                -= Chamber =-0/7

-= Canteen =-
You've just shown up in a canteen.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a rack. You see a key on the rack. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You can make out a pan. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded.



>                                                                                                                                -= Canteen =-0/8
