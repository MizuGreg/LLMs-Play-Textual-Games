Welcome to another fast paced round of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First thing I need you to do is to travel east. Once you accomplish that, lift the passkey from the floor of the bar. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Laundromat =-
You've entered a laundromat.

You see a bench. The bench is typical. But the thing is empty.

There is an unblocked exit to the east. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

-= Bar =-
You find yourself in a bar. A typical one.



There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

There is a passkey on the floor.

That's not a verb I recognise.
