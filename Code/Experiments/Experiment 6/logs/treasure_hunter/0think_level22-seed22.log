Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an fast paced round of TextWorld? You do! First, it would be fantastic if you could try to travel north. That done, head east. Then, attempt to go to the north. Then, venture east. Following that, pick up the keycard from the floor of the bathroom. Alright, thanks!

-= Laundromat =-
Of every laundromat you could have sauntered into, you had to walk into an ordinary one.

As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. The counter is usual. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well

There is an unguarded exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

-= Chamber =-
Look at you, bigshot, walking into a chamber like it isn't some huge deal.

You make out a bar. The bar is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the bar. You can see a bed stand! The bed stand is ordinary. On the bed stand you see a textbook, so there's that.

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south. There is an unguarded exit to the west.
