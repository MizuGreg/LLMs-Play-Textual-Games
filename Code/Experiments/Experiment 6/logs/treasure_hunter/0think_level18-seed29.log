Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! First off, go south. That done, make an attempt to venture south. With that done, take a trip west. Once you get through with that, head north. After that, travel north. Then, make an effort to go west. With that done, try to take a trip west. And then, pick up the keycard from the counter. Got that? Good!

-= Workshop =-
You arrive in a normal kind of place. That is to say, you're in a workshop. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."

As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a bureau. Classic TextWorld. You can make out an armchair. The armchair appears to be empty.

-= Cellar =-
You are in a cellar. A standard one.

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a chest. You smell a wretched smell, and follow it to a stand. You shudder, but continue examining the stand. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You smell a sickening smell, and follow it to a table. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing hasn't got anything on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a shelf. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. However, the shelf, like an empty shelf, has nothing on it.

-= Spare Room =-
This is going to sound unbelievable, but you've just entered a spare room. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You make out a workbench. Now why would someone leave that there? The workbench is usual. The workbench appears to be empty.

You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked.



>                                                                                                                                -= Spare Room =-0/8

-= Sauna =-
You've seen better saunas, but at least this one seems pretty typical. The room is well lit.

You can see a counter. The counter is ordinary. On the counter you can make out a keycard.

>                                                                                                                                -= Sauna =-0/10
