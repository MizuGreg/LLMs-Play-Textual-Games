Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First, it would be fantastic if you could make an effort to head east. With that done, make an attempt to go to the east. After that, go to the north. And then, retrieve the teapot from the floor of the canteen. That's it!

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in a TextWorld game where they need to navigate through different rooms and eventually retrieve the teapot from the canteen's floor. The current setup seems to be looping between the Basement and Spare Room. The user has been instructed to go east, then north, and then get the teapot.

Looking at the history, the user started in the Bedchamber, went east to the Basement, then kept moving south and north between the Basement and Spare Room. The game's messages are repetitive, suggesting that the player is stuck in a loop. The key here is to figure out the correct path to the canteen.

The original goal was to go east, then north, then get the teapot from the canteen. But the current movement is between Basement and Spare Room. Maybe the canteen is in a different part of the map. Alternatively, perhaps the teapot is in the Spare Room, and the user needs to check there.

Wait, the user hasn't found the teapot yet. The instruction was to retrieve it from the canteen's floor. But the current rooms are Basement and Spare Room. Maybe the canteen is in the Spare Room, and the user needs to look for the teapot there. Alternatively, maybe the path to the canteen requires going east from the Basement.

The user has been going south and north between the two rooms, which might not be the right approach. The initial instruction said to go east first, then north. But after going east to the Basement, the next step was to go south, which brings them back to the Spare Room. Maybe the correct path is to go east from the Basement, but the message says there's an exit to the east, which is unblocked. So perhaps the user should try going east from the Basement instead of south.

But the user has been going south and north, which might be a loop. The problem is that the user is stuck in a cycle between the Basement and Spare Room. To break the loop, they need to find a different path. The key is to find the canteen's floor where the teapot is. Maybe the canteen is in the Spare Room, and the user needs to check there. Alternatively, the teapot is in the Basement.

But the user hasn't found the teapot yet. The next step should be to check the rooms for the teapot. Since the user is in the Spare Room, maybe they should look around. However, the game's messages don't mention any objects except the exit. So perhaps the teapot is in the Spare Room, and the user needs to pick it up.

Alternatively, maybe the correct path is to go east from the Basement, which is unblocked, and then proceed further. The user's previous actions were going south and north, which might not be leading them towards the canteen. The initial instruction was to go east, then north, then get the teapot. So perhaps after going east to the Basement, the user should go north again to reach the canteen.

But in the current state, the user is in the Basement, and the message says there's an exit to the east and an unguarded exit to the west. The user has been going south (to Spare Room) and then north back to Basement. This loop suggests that the correct path might be to go east from the Basement. Let me check the initial steps again.

Original instructions: go east, then north, then get teapot from canteen. So after going east to the Basement, the next step was to go north. But in the game, after going east to the Basement, the user was told to try going south. However, the correct path might be to go north from the Basement. Wait, in the first steps, after going east to the Basement, the user was told to go south, but maybe that's a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the canteen is in the Spare Room, and the user needs to go north from the Spare Room to reach it.

But the user is stuck in a loop. The next action should be to go east from the Basement, which is unblocked. Let me check the current room. The user is in the Basement, and the message says there's an exit to the east. So going east from the Basement would be the next step. That might lead to the canteen's floor where the teapot is located. So the correct action is to go east.
