Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First stop, go to the north. And then, move west. If you can succeed at that, head south. Then, head south. Then, move east. After that, doublecheck that the wooden passageway inside the cubicle is ajar. Then, head east. Then, make an attempt to travel east. Following that, lift the keycard from the floor of the workshop. And once you've done that, you win!

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me figure out what to do next. The user has been following the instructions step by step. So far, they've gone north, west, south, south, east, and then tried to go east again. But the wooden passageway was closed, so they had to open it. Now that they've opened it, the next step according to the original plan was to "doublecheck that the wooden passageway inside the cubicle is ajar." Since they just opened it, that's done. Then the next steps were to head east again, then lift the keycard from the floor of the workshop.

Wait, after opening the passageway, the next command in the user's plan was to "head east." So they were in the Cubicle, went east, but the passageway was closed. Then they opened it, and now they're in the Cubicle again. So the next step should be to go east again through the now-open passageway. But the user's last action was "open wooden passageway," and the response was "You open wooden passageway." Now, the next step is to go east again. So the command should be "go east." But the user is in the Cubicle, and after opening the passageway, they can go east into the passageway. Then, after that, they need to lift the keycard from the workshop floor. But first, they need to move east again. So the next action is "go east."

There is a keycard on the floor.

That's not a verb I recognise.

Okay, the user tried to "lift keycard" but the game said that's not a recognized verb. So I need to figure out the correct command. Let me check the available actions in the Workshop. The user is in the Workshop, and there's a keycard on the floor. The possible actions are probably "take keycard" or "pick up keycard". Since "lift" isn't working, maybe the correct verb is "take". So the next action should be "take keycard". That should pick up the keycard from the floor. Then, after taking it, the user would win. So the correct command here is "take keycard".
