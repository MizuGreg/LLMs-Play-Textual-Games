Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me see. The user has been following the steps given in the initial task. They started by checking the bathroom gateway, opened it, went west to the kitchen, opened the hatch, went west again to the office, opened the portal, went north to the attic, opened the door. Now they're at the attic with a chest and a cabinet. The next step according to the original task was to recover the potato from the salon's floor. But the current location is the attic. Wait, maybe there's a mistake here. Let me check the steps again.

Original task steps: After opening the attic door, they needed to venture north again. But the user just opened the door in the attic, which leads north. The next step was to venture north again. However, the current location is the attic, and the door is open north. So the next action should be to go north from the attic. But the user's last action was opening the door, so the next command would be "go north" again. But the user is asking if they're close to the goal. The potato is in the salon, so maybe they need to navigate through the current areas. However, the current location is the attic. The steps might have a misdirection. Alternatively, maybe after opening the attic door, they need to check the chest or cabinet. But the original task didn't mention those. Wait, the original task said after opening the attic door, try to venture north again. So the next step is to go north from the attic. But the user is at the attic, so "go north" is the next command. However, the user is asking if they're close. The potato is in the salon, so perhaps they need to go through the portal in the office, then north again, but the current path is attic. Maybe there's a mistake in the steps. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check the chest or cabinet in the attic for the potato. But the task says to recover the potato from the salon's floor. So perhaps the user needs to go back through the portal to the office, then north again, then through the kitchen, bathroom, etc., but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the potato is in the attic. But the task says salon. Hmm. The user might have taken the correct steps so far, and now needs to go north from the attic. So the next action is "go north".

-= Salon =-
