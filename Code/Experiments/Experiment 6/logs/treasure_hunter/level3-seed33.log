Welcome to TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to travel east. And then, recover the coconut from the floor of the cubicle. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Cookery =-
You are in a cookery. A standard kind of place. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

There is a passkey on the floor.

AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go east
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Cubicle =-
You are in a cubicle. A standard kind of place. The room is well lit.



There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

There is a coconut on the floor.

-= Salon =-
Okay, so you're in a salon, cool, but is it usual? You better believe it is. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.



You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.
