Welcome to another exciting episode of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First of all, venture west. With that done, make an attempt to go to the west. Then, pick-up the broom from the floor of the attic. Alright, thanks!

-= Steam Room =-
Well, here we are in the steam room.

You can make out a counter. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The counter is typical. The counter appears to be empty.

There is an open passageway leading south. There is an open portal leading west. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

-= Studio =-
Of every studio you could have walked into, you had to show up in an ordinary one.

You can see a locker. Classic TextWorld.

There is an open portal leading east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.
