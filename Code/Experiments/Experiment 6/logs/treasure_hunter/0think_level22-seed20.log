Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First off, make an effort to venture south. With that over with, make an attempt to go to the east. After that, head east. Then, try to move north. With that accomplished, recover the loaf of bread from the counter. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Sauna =-
You've walked into a standard room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be standard. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the sauna.

You make out a box. You see a board. The board is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

-= Laundromat =-
You've entered a laundromat.

You make out an opened dresser in the corner. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this?

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the north.

-= Shower =-
You've just sauntered into a shower.

You can see a rack. But there isn't a thing on it.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Garage =-
You find yourself in a garage. A typical kind of place. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a cabinet.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

-= Pantry =-
You've just walked into a pantry. Let's see what's in here.

You can make out a counter. The counter is ordinary. On the counter you can see a loaf of bread.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.
