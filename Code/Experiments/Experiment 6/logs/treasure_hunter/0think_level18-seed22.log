Welcome to another profound episode of TextWorld! First off, open the passageway. After pulling open the passageway, make an effort to take a trip east. And then, attempt to head south. Following that, travel east. And then, take a trip north. And then, make an effort to go east. And then, travel north. That done, retrieve the key from the floor of the studio. And if you do that, you're the winner!
