Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to recover the fondue from the pantry. They've been moving between the Kitchen, Pantry, Bar, Office, and back to the Pantry. The fondue is on the floor in the Pantry. The challenge is to get it without getting stuck in loops.

So far, the user has gone north from the Kitchen to the Pantry, then tried various directions but kept looping. They went east to the Bar, then west back to Pantry, then north to Office, then south back to Pantry. Now they're back at the Pantry again. The exits are still east, north, south. The fondue is there, but maybe the user needs to pick it up. Wait, the original instruction was to "recover the fondue from the floor of the pantry." So maybe the action is just to take the fondue when it's in the pantry.

But in the game's current state, the user is in the Pantry, and the fondue is on the floor. So the next step should be to take the fondue. But the previous actions were just moving around. The user might have been trying to find an exit, but the main goal is to pick up the fondue. However, the game's prompt might require moving to the pantry and then taking the fondue. But in the current state, the user is already in the Pantry. So the next action should be to take the fondue. But the user's previous actions were moving, so maybe they need to take the fondue now.
