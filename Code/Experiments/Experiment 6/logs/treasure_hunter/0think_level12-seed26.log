Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First stop, travel south. And then, go to the west. With that done, recover the hat from the floor of the attic. That's it!

-= Closet =-
I never took you for the sort of person who would show up in a closet, but I guess I was wrong. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You see a workbench. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

There is an unguarded exit to the east. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go south
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Dish-Pit =-
You are in a dish-pit. A standard kind of place.

You make out a closed freezer. You see a case. You can see a saucepan. The saucepan is typical. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm. Oh well

There is an unguarded exit to the east. There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

go west

-= Attic =-
You find yourself in an attic. A standard one.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a hat on the floor.

That's not a verb I recognise.
