Welcome to TextWorld! Here is how to play! First thing I need you to do is to make an effort to go to the south. Then, take a trip south. After that, recover the key from the floor of the canteen. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Steam Room =-
You find yourself in a steam room.



There is an open gate leading north. There is an open portal leading south.

You see a fridge. You see a bowl. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.

There is an open portal leading north. There is an open hatch leading west. There is an unguarded exit to the east. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

You see a counter. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it.

There is an open hatch leading east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

You're now in the vault.

You can make out a rack. The rack is standard. But there isn't a thing on it.

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded.
