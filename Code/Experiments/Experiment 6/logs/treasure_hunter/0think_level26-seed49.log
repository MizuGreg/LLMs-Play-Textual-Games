It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! First, it would be a great idea if you could head south. And then, venture east. Then, travel south. And then, go to the south. After that, pick-up the sponge from the floor of the sauna. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Workshop =-
You're now in the workshop. You begin looking for stuff.

Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a mantelpiece. However, the mantelpiece, like an empty mantelpiece, has nothing on it. You can see a table. But there isn't a thing on it.

There is an unguarded exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

You arrive in a laundromat. An ordinary one.

You smell an intriguing smell, and follow it to a board. Now why would someone leave that there? The board is ordinary. But there isn't a thing on it.
