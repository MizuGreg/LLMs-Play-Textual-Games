It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! First of all, you could, like, make an attempt to go north. That done, go west. After that, move north. Next, take a trip east. That done, go to the east. After that, go south. And then, venture south. And then, take a trip east. If you can manage that, recover the frisbee from the floor of the closet. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Shower =-
Well, here we are in a shower. You begin looking for stuff.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

-= Cookery =-
You are in a cookery. An ordinary kind of place. Let's see what's in here.

You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a rack. You wonder idly who left that here. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well

There is an open gate leading north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. There is an unguarded exit to the south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game and has been following a specific path. The initial instructions mentioned moving in certain directions: north, west, north again, east, east again, south, south, east, and then retrieving a frisbee from a closet. But the current scenario is in a cookery, and the user is at a point where they need to decide their next move.

Looking at the current environment description for the cookery, there are exits in multiple directions: north, east, south, and west. The user's previous action was going east from the shower, which led them to the cookery. Now, they need to choose the next direction. The prompt suggests trying east again, as per the initial plan. But the user is asking if they're on the right track and what their next move should be.

The key here is to follow the original path outlined in the first message. The user was instructed to go east from the cookery. The description mentions an open gate north, but the user should check if that's part of the planned path. However, the original plan after the cookery would be to go east again. But wait, the initial steps after the shower were: east, then west, north, east, east, south, south, east. But in the cookery, the user is at a point where they can go east, south, west, or north. The original plan after the cookery might have been to go east again. However, the user's current position is in the cookery, and the next step according to the initial instructions was to go east again. But the user is now asking if they're on the right track. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check if the next move is east again. The original plan said after the cookery, the next step was to go east. But the user is in the cookery and the description says there's an unguarded exit to the south. However, the initial plan after the cookery might have been to go east. But the user's current position is in the cookery, and the next step according to the original instructions was to go east. However, the user is now at the cookery, and the next move should be east. But the user is asking if they're on the right track. The answer is yes, because the original plan was to go east from the cookery. So the next action should be go east.

-= Closet =-
You find yourself in a closet. A normal kind of place.



There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

There is a frisbee on the floor.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Closet now. The goal was to recover the frisbee from the floor of the closet. The previous steps were going east, then east again, then south, then south, then east. But the current location is the Closet.

In the Closet, there's a frisbee on the floor. The user needs to pick it up. But the game's commands are about movement, not interacting with objects. Wait, but the user's last action was going west, as per the prompt. Wait, the prompt says: "You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west." So maybe the user is supposed to go west from the Closet. But the Closet has an exit to the south, which is unblocked. But the user is already in the Closet. The frisbee is on the floor. So maybe the correct action is to pick up the frisbee. But the game might require moving to a location where the frisbee is, but it's already in the Closet. Wait, the user is in the Closet, and the frisbee is on the floor. So the next step is to take the frisbee. But the game's commands might not include taking items unless specified. However, in some text adventures, you can pick up items by just being in the room. But the user's previous actions were movement commands. The original instruction said to "recover the frisbee from the floor of the closet." So maybe the user is already in the Closet, and the frisbee is there. So the next action is to take the frisbee. But the game might require the user to move to the Closet first. Wait, the user is already in the Closet. So the correct action is to take the frisbee. But the system message says to only output the action, like "go north". However, if the game allows taking the frisbee, then the command would be "take frisbee". But the previous commands were movement. Maybe the game expects the user to move to the Closet and then pick it up. But the user is already in the Closet. So the next step is to take the frisbee. But the user's previous action was "go west", which might have led them to the Closet. So the correct action is to take the frisbee. However, the game might not have a "take" command. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go south to exit, but the goal is to get the frisbee. So the answer is to take the frisbee. But the system message says to only output the command. So the correct action is "take frisbee".
