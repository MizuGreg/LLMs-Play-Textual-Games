Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, you could, like, make an effort to go to the east. With that done, make an attempt to travel east. Okay, and then, go north. If you can get through with that, try to go north. Okay, and then, make an effort to go west. With that done, go to the north. And then, make an attempt to head west. Then, try to head west. Next, travel south. If you can manage that, try to go south. With that over with, recover the latchkey from the refrigerator within the kitchen. And once you've done that, you win!
