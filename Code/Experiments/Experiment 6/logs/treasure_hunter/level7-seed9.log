Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First, it would be fantastic if you could make an effort to head east. With that done, make an attempt to go to the east. After that, go to the north. And then, retrieve the teapot from the floor of the canteen. That's it!

-= Bedchamber =-
You find yourself in a bedchamber. A standard kind of place.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked.

You arrive in a basement. An ordinary kind of place.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and retrieve a teapot. The current location is the Basement. The user has already gone east from the Bedchamber to the Basement. Now, the Basement has an exit to the east, south, and west. The goal is to get to the canteen's floor to retrieve the teapot.

First, I need to figure out the correct path. The original instructions said to go east, then north, then get the teapot from the canteen's floor. But the user is in the Basement now. The Basement's description mentions an exit to the east, south, and west. The user's previous action was going east, which led them here. Now, they need to head north, but the Basement's exits don't include north. Wait, the user was told to go east first, then north. But in the Basement, the exits are east, south, west. So maybe the next step is to go south or west to reach another area.

Wait, the original plan was to go east, then north. But in the Bedchamber, the user was told to go east, which led to the Basement. Now, from the Basement, the user needs to go north. But the Basement's exits don't have a north direction. So maybe the user needs to go west or south first to reach a room that has a north exit. Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go north from the Basement, but that's not an available exit. So perhaps the correct path is to go west from the Basement to reach a room that allows moving north. Alternatively, maybe the user should go south from the Basement. Let me check the room descriptions again.

The Basement's description says: "There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the west." So the exits are east, south, and west. So from the Basement, the user can go south or west. The original goal was to go north after going east. But since the Basement doesn't have a north exit, the user needs to find another way. Maybe the correct path is to go west from the Basement to reach a room that allows moving north. Alternatively, maybe the user should go south to reach a room that has a north exit. Let's think about the possible rooms.

If the user goes west from the Basement, they might reach the Bedchamber again. But the Bedchamber's exit is east. Alternatively, going south from the Basement might lead to another room. But the user's goal is to reach the canteen's floor. Maybe the canteen is in a different part of the map. The user needs to retrieve the teapot from the canteen's floor, so they need to get to the canteen. The initial instructions said to go east, then north. But perhaps the path is different. Maybe after going east to the Basement, the user needs to go south to reach a room that leads to the canteen. Alternatively, maybe the user should go west to the Bedchamber, then north, but the Bedchamber's north exit isn't mentioned. Wait, the Bedchamber's description says "You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked." So the Bedchamber has an exit to the east, but not north. So going west from the Basement would take the user back to the Bedchamber, which doesn't have a north exit. Therefore, maybe the user needs to go south from the Basement to reach another area. Let me check the possible exits again.

From the Basement, the user can go east, south, or west. The user is currently in the Basement. The next step is to go south or west. If the user goes south, they might reach a room that allows moving north. Alternatively, going west to the Bedchamber and then trying to find another exit. But the Bedchamber only has an east exit. Alternatively, maybe the user should go south from the Basement to reach the canteen's floor. But I'm not sure. The user's goal is to retrieve the teapot from the canteen's floor. So the user needs to reach the canteen. The initial instructions said to go east, then north. But in the current scenario, after going east to the Basement, the user needs to go north. However, the Basement doesn't have a north exit. Therefore, the user must find another path. Perhaps the correct action is to go south from the Basement to reach a room that has a north exit leading to the canteen. Alternatively, the user might need to go west to the Bedchamber, then find another way. But the Bedchamber's exits are only east. So maybe the correct path is to go south from the Basement. Let's assume that going south from the Basement leads to a room that allows moving north towards the canteen. Therefore, the next action should be to go south.

-= Spare Room =-
You've entered a spare room. The room is well lit.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in a text-based game. The original goal was to go east, then north, and retrieve the teapot from the canteen's floor.

Starting in the bedchamber, they went east to the basement. Then from the basement, they went south to the spare room. Now, in the spare room, the hint says "You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north." So the next logical step is to go north from the spare room. 

But wait, the user's previous action was going south from the basement to the spare room. The current room is the spare room. The hint suggests going north from here. If they go north, they might reach the next room. The original plan was to go east, then north. But they've already gone east once (to the basement). Maybe the path is a loop, but the goal is to find the teapot in the canteen. 

Alternatively, maybe the canteen is part of the basement or spare room. But the user needs to retrieve the teapot from the canteen's floor. So perhaps after going north from the spare room, they might find the canteen or the teapot. But the current room is the spare room, and the hint says to go north. So the correct next action is to go north.

Starting from the bedchamber, they went east to the basement. Then they went south to the spare room and back north to the basement again. Now they're back in the basement, and the next step is probably to continue moving towards the east or west to find the canteen. But the user needs to reach the canteen's floor to get the teapot. 

The basement has an exit to the east and a west exit. The spare room had a north exit leading back to the basement. Maybe the canteen is in the east direction. The user should keep going east from the basement. But the current location is the basement again, so the next action should be to go east. However, the user might have to check if the canteen is in that direction. Since the original plan was to go east, then north, maybe after reaching the canteen, they can go north. But the canteen's floor is part of the environment. Maybe the teapot is in the basement? Or perhaps the canteen is a different room. 

Wait, the user's initial instructions said to go east, then north, then retrieve the teapot from the canteen's floor. So maybe the canteen is a room that's north of the basement. But the user is currently in the basement. So the next step is to go east to reach the canteen. But the basement's east exit is unblocked. So the user should go east from the basement.

The original plan was to go east, then north. But the path seems to be taking them through the basement and sauna. Maybe the canteen is in a different direction.

Starting from the bedchamber, they went east to the basement. Then they went south to the spare room, north back to the basement, east to the sauna, then west back to the basement. Now they're back in the basement again. The current room description mentions an exit to the east, south, and west. The user has been moving between these rooms, but hasn't found the teapot yet.

The teapot is supposed to be in the canteen's floor. So maybe the canteen is a different room. The user has been in the basement, sauna, spare room, etc. Maybe they need to find the canteen. But the current room is the basement. The exits here are east, south, west. The user might need to go east again to the sauna, but that's where they were before. Alternatively, maybe going south from the basement to the spare room again. But the original path was bedchamber -> basement -> spare room -> basement -> sauna -> basement. 

Wait, the user's goal was to go east, then north, then get the teapot. Maybe the canteen is in a different part. But the current room is the basement. The user hasn't reached the canteen yet.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go north from the basement to the sauna, but that's already been done. Hmm. The user is stuck in a loop between the basement and sauna. The original goal was to get to the canteen's floor. Maybe the canteen is in the spare room? Or perhaps the user needs to go west from the basement to exit. But the exit to the west is unguarded. Wait, the user is in the basement, and the exit to the west is unguarded. Maybe that's the way out. But the original goal was to retrieve the teapot from the canteen. So maybe the canteen is in a different room. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east again from the basement to the sauna, then north, but that's already been done. The user might need to find the canteen through another path. But based on the current room, the user is in the basement. The next step would be to go east again to the sauna, but that's already been done.

But the user is at the basement again, so maybe the correct path is to go east to the sauna, then north, but that's already been done. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west from the basement to exit, but that's not helpful. Wait, the original instructions said to go east, then north, then get the teapot. So maybe after going north, the user should look for the teapot. But in the current path, the user hasn't reached the canteen yet. Maybe the canteen is in the spare room? But the spare room was well-lit, but no teapot mentioned. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east from the basement to the sauna, then north again, but that's already been done. The user might be stuck in a loop. The next action would be to go east again, but that's the same as before. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go south from the basement to the spare room again.

Starting from the bedchamber, they went east to the basement. Then they went south to the spare room, north back to the basement, east again to the sauna, west back to the basement, and east again to the sauna. Now they're in the sauna again, and the prompt says to try going north or west.

Wait, the user's previous action was going east from the basement to the sauna (step 7). Now, in the sauna, the options are north or west. But the original plan was to go north after going east. However, the user has been moving between basement and sauna, maybe getting stuck in a loop. 

The goal is to reach the canteen's floor to get the teapot. The canteen isn't mentioned in the current rooms. Maybe the teapot is in a different area. But the user's path so far hasn't reached the canteen. 

The user might be going in circles between the basement and sauna. The original instructions said to go east, then north, then retrieve the teapot. But the current location is the sauna. Maybe the correct path is to go north from the sauna, but that's not clear. Alternatively, perhaps the canteen is in a different part of the map. 

Since the user is in the sauna, the next step should be to check if going north or west leads closer to the canteen. But the user's previous actions haven't found the canteen yet. Maybe the correct path is to go north from the sauna, but the user might need to find the right sequence of rooms to reach the canteen's floor. 

Alternatively, maybe the teapot is in the basement. But the user hasn't checked the basement's floor. However, the original instruction was to retrieve the teapot from the canteen's floor. So the user needs to find the canteen. 

Given the current position in the sauna, the next action should be to go north or west. The user might need to go north from the sauna to reach the canteen. But since the user is in the sauna, going north might lead to another room. However, the user's previous steps have been moving between basement and sauna. 

The user might be missing the correct path. The original plan was to go east, then north. But the user has been going back and forth. Maybe the correct path is to go north from the sauna, but that's not clear. Alternatively, maybe the canteen is in the basement. 

But the user hasn't found the canteen yet. The next action should be to go north from the sauna, as per the prompt. So the answer is go north.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a text adventure game. Their goal is to retrieve the teapot from the canteen floor. So far, they've navigated through several rooms: bedchamber, basement, spare room, sauna, and now the canteen. The current room is the canteen, where they've found a keycard and a teapot on the floor.

The user's next action should be to pick up the teapot. Since the teapot is on the floor, the correct command would be "take teapot" or "get teapot". But in many text adventures, the exact phrasing matters. The game might expect "take" or "get". Looking at the previous interactions, the user has been using "go" commands. However, in this room, the teapot is an object that needs to be picked up, so the action should be to take it. The keycard might not be necessary here, as the goal is the teapot. So the next command should be "take teapot".
