Welcome to TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, you could, like, try to move west. Next, go to the south. With that done, go south. Then, attempt to head east. Next, pick-up the stick of butter from the floor of the bathroom. That's it!

-= Austere Studio =-
You've entered an austere studio.



There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

>                                                                                                                                -= Austere Studio =-0/1

go west
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Closet =-
Well, here we are in the closet. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.



There is an unguarded exit to the east. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.



>                                                                                                                                -= Closet =-0/2
AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go south
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Basement =-
Look around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a basement.

You see a crate. You see a shelf. You shudder, but continue examining the shelf. The shelf is normal. However, the shelf, like an empty shelf, has nothing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You smell an intriguing smell, and follow it to a rack. The rack is typical. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.



>                                                                                                                                -= Basement =-0/3

-= Bedroom =-
You've entered a bedroom. Let's see what's in here.

You can see a bar. The bar is standard. But there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the bar.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unblocked exit to the north.



>                                                                                                                                -= Bedroom =-0/4
AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go east
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Bathroom =-
Well I'll be, you are in a place we're calling a bathroom.

As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a case. Classic TextWorld. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this?

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

There is a stick of butter on the floor.


>                                                                                                                                -= Bathroom =-0/5

That's not a verb I recognise.
