Welcome to TextWorld! Here is how to play! First stop, make an attempt to move south. Then, make an effort to head west. With that over with, retrieve the fondue from the floor of the studio. Alright, thanks!

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south. There is an unguarded exit to the west.
