Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First thing I need you to do is to make an effort to head south. With that accomplished, attempt to head south. With that over with, lift the key from the floor of the kitchen. Got that? Good!

-= Bedroom =-
You've just sauntered into a bedroom.



There is an open door leading south. There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.
