Welcome to another exciting round of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First stop, go to the east. With that over with, attempt to head south. After that, go to the west. Then, pick-up the sandwich from the floor of the bedroom. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Shower =-
I am sorry to announce that you are now in the shower.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

-= Studio =-
Okay, so you're in a studio, cool, but is it standard? You better believe it is.



There is an unblocked exit to the south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go south
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Bathroom =-
Well how about that, you are in a place we're calling a bathroom. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.



>                                                                                                                                -= Bathroom =-0/3

-= Bedroom =-
You've just walked into a bedroom.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

There is a sandwich and a key on the floor.


>                                                                                                                                -= Bedroom =-0/4
