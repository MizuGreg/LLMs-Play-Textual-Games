I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First stop, venture east. And then, make an effort to head north. Then, attempt to take a trip east. That done, pick up the pear from the floor of the cookery. Alright, thanks!

-= Cellar =-
You find yourself in a cellar. A standard one.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.
