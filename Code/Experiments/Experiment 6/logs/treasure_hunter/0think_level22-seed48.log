Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, you could, like, go to the west. Next, make an attempt to travel north. After that, attempt to go west. After that, venture south. After that, pick-up the latchkey from the floor of the kitchenette. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Shower =-
Well, here we are in a shower. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You see a board. Now why would someone leave that there? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

go west

-= Workshop =-
You arrive in a workshop. A typical one.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a chair. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can make out a desk. The desk is usual. However, the desk, like an empty desk, has nothing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the north. There is an unguarded exit to the south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

-= Office =-
Well how about that, you are in a place we're calling an office.

You can see an opened case. The case is empty, what a horrible day!

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

-= Basement =-
You've just walked into a basement. The room is well lit.

You see a counter. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.
