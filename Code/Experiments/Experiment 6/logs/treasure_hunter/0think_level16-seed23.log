Welcome to TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to make an attempt to move west. Then, make an attempt to go to the south. With that accomplished, go south. Then, ensure that the portal is open. Then, go to the south. With that accomplished, pick up the mug from the floor of the cookery. Alright, thanks!

-= Cellar =-
You're now in a cellar.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

There is a keycard on the floor.

-= Dish-Pit =-
You arrive in a dish-pit. An ordinary one. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. The fridge is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever!

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

-= Playroom =-
You arrive in a playroom. An usual kind of place.

Hey, want to see a bookshelf? Look over there, a bookshelf. The bookshelf is typical. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the bookshelf.

You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Workshop =-
You're now in a workshop.

You can see an opened portmanteau in the corner. The portmanteau is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever!

-= Cookery =-
You find yourself in a cookery. An ordinary kind of place. Let's see what's in here.

You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to a cabinet. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The cabinet is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever!

There is an open portal leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a mug on the floor.
