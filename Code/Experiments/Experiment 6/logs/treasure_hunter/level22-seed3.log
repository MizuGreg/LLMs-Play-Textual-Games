Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, you could, like, venture east. Following that, travel south. With that accomplished, head south. With that over with, travel south. And then, pick up the shadfly from the floor of the laundromat. And if you do that, you're the winner!

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.
