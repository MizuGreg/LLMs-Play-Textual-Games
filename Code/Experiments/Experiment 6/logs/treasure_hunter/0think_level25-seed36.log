Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. Your first objective is to take a trip south. If you can get through with that, take the fresh laundry scented latchkey from the bed within the salon. And then, unlock the fresh laundry scented door within the salon with the fresh laundry scented latchkey. After that, open the fresh laundry scented door within the salon. And then, make an attempt to travel south. And then, move east. After that, attempt to take a trip east. Okay, and then, take a trip south. Next, make it so that the gateway is ajar. Having opened the gateway, attempt to take a trip west. With that accomplished, retrieve the loaf of bread from the floor of the kitchen. That's it!
