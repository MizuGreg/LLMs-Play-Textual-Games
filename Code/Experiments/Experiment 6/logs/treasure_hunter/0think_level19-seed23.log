Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an exciting round of TextWorld? You do! Here is your task for today. First thing I need you to do is to make an attempt to go to the east. With that accomplished, go north. Then, move west. Next, make an attempt to head west. And then, make an attempt to go south. Then, make an attempt to move south. Then, doublecheck that the portal is wide open. And then, make an attempt to move south. And then, pick-up the mug from the floor of the cookery. Alright, thanks!
