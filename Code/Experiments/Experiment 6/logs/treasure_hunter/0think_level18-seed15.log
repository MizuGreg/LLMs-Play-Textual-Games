It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First thing I need you to do is to go east. After that, ensure that the gateway within the canteen is open. Then, make an effort to venture north. After that, make an attempt to go north. Next, make an effort to take a trip north. That done, make an effort to head west. And then, go to the south. After that, pick up the sandwich from the floor of the lounge. And once you've done that, you win!
