Welcome to TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First stop, make an attempt to head west. After that, move west. If you can get around to doing that, take the key from the rack. Alright, thanks!

-= Cookhouse =-
You find yourself in a cookhouse. An ordinary kind of place.

A locked refrigerator, which looks ordinary, is close by. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a shelf. But the thing is empty.

There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

-= Bedchamber =-
You arrive in a bedchamber. A normal one.

You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a recliner. The recliner is normal. The recliner appears to be empty.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Kitchen =-
This might come as a shock to you, but you've just walked into a kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You see a closed standard looking chest nearby. You can make out a fridge. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a rack. The rack is ordinary. On the rack you make out a key, so there's that. You see a saucepan. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. There is an unblocked exit to the north.
