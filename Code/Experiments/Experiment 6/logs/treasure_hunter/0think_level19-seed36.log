Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is how to play! First, it would be fantastic if you could open the gateway. Then, go to the east. With that over with, attempt to go to the south. And then, open the hatch in the study. After that, attempt to travel south. If you can succeed at that, venture west. Then, attempt to go to the south. And then, make an attempt to take a trip east. And then, lift the sandwich from the floor of the workshop. And if you do that, you're the winner!

There is a sandwich on the floor.
