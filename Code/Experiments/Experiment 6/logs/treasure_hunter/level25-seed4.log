It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! First thing I need you to do is to go to the north. And then, go to the east. After that, go north. And then, venture west. And then, take a trip north. If you can manage that, make an effort to head east. Then, make an attempt to venture east. Then, venture south. With that accomplished, take a trip south. Next, travel east. If you can finish that, recover the frisbee from the floor of the closet. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Salon =-
You arrive in a salon. A standard one.

Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a portmanteau. A closed dresser, which looks typical, is right there by you. You can make out a desk. The desk appears to be empty. Hm. Oh well

There is an open hatch leading north. There is an open passageway leading south.

-= Cubicle =-
You've entered a cubicle. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."



There is an open hatch leading south. There is an unblocked exit to the east. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north.

There is a passkey on the floor.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game and has followed a sequence of directions. The current location is a cubicle. The user needs to go north, but there's a passkey on the floor. The original goal was to recover the frisbee from the closet and then win.

First, I need to figure out the correct path. The initial instructions said to go north, then east, north, west, north, east, east, south, south, east, then get the frisbee. But the user is in the cubicle now. The passkey might be necessary to proceed north. Without it, maybe the hatch is locked. So the next step should be to pick up the passkey. Then, go north through the hatch. After that, the user would move east as per the instructions. But the user is asking if they're on the right track. Since the passkey is needed to go north, the correct action here is to pick it up. Then proceed north. So the next command should be to take the passkey. Wait, but the user's previous action was going north. Wait, the user's last action was "go north" from the salon to the cubicle. Now, in the cubicle, the passkey is on the floor. So the next step is to pick it up. Then, go north again. But the user's next action should be to take the passkey. But the user's instruction says to only output the action. So the correct next step is to take the passkey. But the user's current location is the cubicle, and the passkey is on the floor. So the command should be "take passkey". Then, go north. But the user's next action is to take the passkey. Then proceed north. So the answer is "take passkey".
