Welcome to another fast paced game of TextWorld! First step, attempt to move east. And then, pick-up the sandwich from the floor of the workshop. That's it!

-= Spare Room =-
You find yourself in a spare room. A normal kind of place. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."

Oh, great. Here's a rack. The rack is standard. However, the rack, like an empty rack, has nothing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the rack.

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Workshop =-
You've seen better workshops, but at least this one seems pretty normal.

You see a bureau. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things.

You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

There is a sandwich on the floor.
