Welcome to TextWorld! First of all, you could, like, make an effort to travel east. Then, travel east. And then, make an attempt to travel east. Then, make an attempt to take a trip south. Okay, and then, venture south. Then, try to take a trip west. If you can do that, retrieve the desktop computer from the floor of the austere workshop. Got that? Good!

-= Playroom =-
You're now in a playroom. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."

You can see a closed locker. You can see a portmanteau. The portmanteau is empty, what a horrible day!

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

Well, here we are in the cookhouse.

What's that over there? It looks like it's a board. The board is normal. The board appears to be empty. You think about smashing the board to bits, throwing the bits into a pit, etc, until you get bored.
