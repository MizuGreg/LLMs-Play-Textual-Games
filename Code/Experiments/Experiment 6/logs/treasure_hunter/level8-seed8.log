Welcome to TextWorld! Here is how to play! First, it would be good if you could go south. Following that, travel east. With that done, attempt to go to the east. And then, pick-up the shoe from the floor of the attic. Got that? Good!

-= Office =-
You are in an office. A standard kind of place. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."



There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

-= Study =-
Well, here we are in a study.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Study room now. The previous steps were going south from the Office to the Study. The Study has exits to the north and east. The original goal was to pick up the shoe from the attic, but the user hasn't reached that yet.

The user's current location is the Study. The next step mentioned in the initial instructions was to go east. But in the Study, the user is told that both north and east are unblocked. Wait, the initial instruction said after going south (to Study), travel east. But in the Study, the user can go north or east. So maybe the next step is to go east from the Study. But the user might need to check if there's a path to the attic. However, the user hasn't found the attic yet. Maybe going east from the Study leads to the attic? Or perhaps the attic is accessible via another path.

Alternatively, the user might need to go north first. But the initial instruction said after going south, travel east. So maybe the correct sequence is Study -> East. But the user is in the Study, so the next action should be to go east. Let me check the previous messages. The user was told to go south first, then east. So after arriving in the Study, the next step is to go east. So the correct command here is "go east".
</think>go east

-= Cubicle =-
You are in a cubicle. An ordinary one. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the west.



>                                                                                                                                -= Cubicle =-0/3

Okay, let's see. The user has been moving through different rooms in the game: first south from the office to the study, then east to the cubicle. The original goal mentioned was to pick up the shoe from the attic. So far, they've gone through the office, study, and cubicle. The next step would be to figure out the direction towards the attic. The current room is the cubicle, which has exits to the north, east, and west. The user was told to go east from the study, which led them here. Maybe the attic is in the north or west? But the user needs to check. Since the cubicle's north exit is unguarded, maybe that's the way. Alternatively, the west exit might lead to another area. But the original path was south, then east. Maybe the next step is to go north from the cubicle to find the attic. Alternatively, maybe the shoe is in the attic, which is part of the study or another room. Wait, the original instruction said to go to the east from the study, then pick up the shoe in the attic. So perhaps after the cubicle, going north would lead to the attic. The user needs to proceed north.
</think>go north

-= Recreation Zone =-
You're now in a recreation zone. You start to take note of what's in the room.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.



>                                                                                                                                -= Recreation Zone =-0/4

Okay, let's see. The user has been moving through different rooms in the game: Office, Study, Cubicle, and now Recreation Zone. The original goal mentioned was to pick up the shoe from the attic. So far, the user has been moving south, east, north, and now south again.

In the Recreation Zone, the prompt says to go south. The previous moves were following the directions given in each room's description. The user is probably following the correct path. The next step would be to go south from the Recreation Zone. But wait, the user's last action was "go south" from the Recreation Zone, which would take them back to the Cubicle. But the goal is the attic. Maybe the path isn't straightforward. Alternatively, maybe the shoe is in the Recreation Zone, but the user hasn't checked the rooms properly. However, the user is following the given directions, so the next action should be south again. But the user's last move was south, so maybe the next step is to check the east or west. Wait, the Recreation Zone's description says to go south. So the next command should be "go south" again. But the user might be moving in a loop. However, the original plan was to go east from the Study, then north, then south. Maybe the correct path is to go east from the Recreation Zone. But the prompt says to go south. Hmm. The user needs to follow the directions given in each room. The Recreation Zone says to go south. So the next action is "go south".

Okay, let's see. The user has been moving through different rooms in the game: Office, Study, Cubicle, Recreation Zone, and back to Cubicle. The original goal mentioned was to pick up the shoe from the attic. So far, the user has been navigating through the buildings, moving south, east, north, and south again.

Now, in the current Cubicle room, the prompt says to try going east, as there's an exit to the north and west. The user has been following the advice given each time, which seems to be leading them through the structures. However, the shoe is in the attic, which hasn't been mentioned yet. The user might need to find the attic or a way up to it.

But the current room is a Cubicle, and the exits are north, east, and west. The previous steps have been moving through the buildings, possibly in a loop. The user might need to check if there's a way to reach the attic from here. Since the attic isn't mentioned in the current room's description, maybe the next step is to explore east, which was suggested. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go north or west to find another path. But the user's previous actions have been following the "try going east" advice, so perhaps continuing that direction is the right move. However, since the user is back in the Cubicle after going south from the Recreation Zone, maybe the next step is to go east again to proceed further. The user needs to keep moving towards the attic, which is the goal. So the next action should be to go east.
</think>go east

-= Attic =-
Well, here we are in the attic.



There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

There is a latchkey and a shoe on the floor.

Okay, let's see. The user has been navigating through different rooms in the TextWorld game. The original goal mentioned was to pick up the shoe from the attic. So far, they've gone from the office, study, cubicle, recreation zone, and back to the cubicle, finally reaching the attic.

In the attic, the description says there's a latchkey and a shoe on the floor. The user's next action should be to pick up the shoe. Since the game requires only the command to be outputted, the correct action here is "take shoe" or "pick up shoe". But looking at the previous commands, the user has been using "go" commands. However, in this room, the objective is to pick up the shoe, so the appropriate action is to take the shoe. The latchkey might be a red herring or part of another puzzle, but the goal is the shoe. So the next command should be to take the shoe.
