Welcome to another exciting round of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First off, ensure that the portal is open. After that, go west. With that done, venture south. And then, recover the latchkey from the floor of the closet. Got that? Good!

-= Bedchamber =-
You've just walked into a bedchamber.

You can see a closed basket. What's that over there? It looks like it's a mantle. The mantle is ordinary. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.

There is a closed portal leading west. There is an open hatch leading east.
