Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, you could, like, go east. And then, make an attempt to go east. After that, venture north. And then, make an effort to move west. With that over with, move west. With that accomplished, recover the broom from the floor of the attic. Got that? Good!

-= Washroom =-
Fancy seeing you here. Here, by the way, being the washroom. You can barely contain your excitement.

Oh, great. Here's a board. The board is standard. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. You see a rack. The rack is standard. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked.
