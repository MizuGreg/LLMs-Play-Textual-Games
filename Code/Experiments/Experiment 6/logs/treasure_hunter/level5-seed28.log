You are now playing a exciting game of TextWorld! First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to travel east. And then, try to venture north. And then, pick-up the passkey from the floor of the laundry place. That's it!

-= Scullery =-
You find yourself in a scullery. A normal one. You can barely contain your excitement.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

-= Workshop =-
You've entered a workshop. You begin looking for stuff.



There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

There is a mug on the floor.

-= Laundry Place =-
You find yourself in a laundry place. An usual one. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

There is a passkey on the floor.
