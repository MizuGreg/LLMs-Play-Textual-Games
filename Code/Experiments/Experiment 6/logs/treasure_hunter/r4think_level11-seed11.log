Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game where they have to navigate through different rooms and complete certain tasks. The goal mentioned earlier was to "play through a life-changing round of TextWorld," which probably involves reaching a specific destination or solving a puzzle.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Kitchen. The rooms they've visited so far are Sauna, Cookhouse, Cookery, and Kitchen. The previous actions involved moving south from the Sauna to the Cookhouse, then lifting the teaspoon, going west to the Cookery, and then north back to the Kitchen. Now, they're stuck in a loop between Cookery and Kitchen, moving north and south repeatedly.

The user is asking if they're making the right actions and if they're close to the goal. The key here is to determine the correct path based on the clues given. The initial instruction said to "head south" first, then lift the teaspoon. After that, they could stop. But maybe there's more to it.

In the Kitchen, there's a closed fridge, a stick of butter on the floor, and exits to east, north, and south. The Cookery has an exit to east and north. The Cookhouse had a teaspoon on the floor. The Sauna had an exit to south. The original goal might be to reach a specific room or open the fridge. Since the user has the teaspoon, maybe that's a key item needed to open the fridge. But the fridge is closed, so they might need to use the teaspoon to open it. Alternatively, the butter could be part of a puzzle.

But the user is stuck in a loop. The last action was going north from Cookery to Kitchen, then south back to Cookery. They need to find a way to progress. The Cookery has an unguarded exit to the east, which might lead to another room. The Kitchen has an exit to the south, which is the Cookery again. Maybe the correct path is to go east from Cookery, but the user hasn't tried that yet. Alternatively, the fridge in the Kitchen might need to be opened, but the user hasn't interacted with it yet.

Wait, the user has the teaspoon. Maybe the teaspoon is needed to open the fridge. So the next step would be to use the teaspoon on the fridge. But the user hasn't done that yet. The current location is the Kitchen, so they should check the fridge. The command would be to open the fridge, but the game might require using the teaspoon. Alternatively, the user might need to go east from the Kitchen to another room.

But the user is at the Kitchen, and the exits are east, north, and south. The fridge is closed. The user might need to open it, but how? The teaspoon could be the key. So the next action should be to use the teaspoon on the fridge. But the game's commands might require a specific verb. Since the user previously tried "lift the teaspoon," which worked, maybe "open" is the next verb. However, the user is in the Kitchen, so the correct action would be to open the fridge. But the user hasn't done that yet. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east from the Kitchen to reach the next room, which might have the solution.

But the user is asking if they're close to the goal. The initial instructions said to lift the teaspoon and then stop. But maybe there's more to it. The user might need to reach the fridge, open it, and use the teaspoon inside. However, the current state is that the user is in the Kitchen, and the fridge is closed. The next logical step is to try opening the fridge. But the user hasn't tried that yet. So the correct action would be to open the fridge. But the game might require using the teaspoon to open it. So the user should try using the teaspoon on the fridge. However, the user's previous action was going north, which led back to the Kitchen. So the next step is to open the fridge. But the user needs to check if that's possible.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Kitchen, and the fridge is already open. They have the teaspoon, which they tried to use on the fridge but got an error. The previous attempts to open the fridge were redundant since it's already open. The goal was to lift the teaspoon and then stop, but maybe there's more to it. The user is stuck in a loop, moving between rooms without making progress. The correct action might be to go east from the Kitchen, as that's the unblocked exit mentioned. The user needs to explore other rooms instead of repeating actions. So the next step should be to go east.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user has been moving around the rooms, lifting the teaspoon, and trying to open the fridge. But the fridge was already open, so that didn't help. Now they're back in the Cookhouse, which is a standard place with a teaspoon on the floor. The original goal was to "play through a life-changing round of TextWorld," which might involve reaching a specific room or solving a puzzle.

The user is at the Cookhouse again. The previous actions were going south from the Sauna to the Cookhouse, then lifting the teaspoon. Now, they need to decide whether to go north or west. The提示 says to try going north or west since they need an unguarded exit. But the user has already been here before. Maybe the correct path is to go west, as the entranceway is unguarded. Alternatively, going north might lead to another room. But the user is stuck in a loop, so they need to find a new direction. The teaspoon is on the floor again, so maybe they need to lift it again, but they already did that. Wait, the user might need to use the teaspoon in a different way. But the game's commands are limited, and the user is getting errors when trying to use it. So the next step is probably to go west, as that's unguarded and might lead to a new room. Let's check the previous rooms: Sauna, Cookhouse, Cookery, Kitchen, back to Sauna. Maybe the correct path is to go west from the Cookhouse. So the next action should be go west.
