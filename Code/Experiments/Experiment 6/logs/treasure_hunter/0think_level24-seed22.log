What's that over there? It looks like it's a pan. The pan is usual. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a platter. But there isn't a thing on it. You can see a board. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

Ah, the garage. This is some kind of garage, really great ordinary vibes in this place, a wonderful ordinary atmosphere.



There is an unguarded exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

You are in a scullery. An usual kind of place. You start to take note of what's in the room.

What's that over there? It looks like it's a pan. The pan is usual. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a platter. But there isn't a thing on it. You can see a board. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.
