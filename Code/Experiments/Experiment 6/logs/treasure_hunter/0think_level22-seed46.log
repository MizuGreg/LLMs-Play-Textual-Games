Welcome to another exciting game of TextWorld! Here is how to play! Your first objective is to try to travel north. And then, head east. If you can manage that, move north. Then, try to go to the west. And then, pick up the key from the floor of the cubicle. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Canteen =-
You find yourself in a canteen. An ordinary kind of place. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You can see a board. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. There is an unblocked exit to the north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

You are in a cubicle. A normal kind of place.

You can see a bureau. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a mantelpiece. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

There is a key on the floor.
