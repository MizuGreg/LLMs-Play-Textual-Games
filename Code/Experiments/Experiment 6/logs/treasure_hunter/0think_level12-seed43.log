Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First step, attempt to go to the east. And then, go to the north. Okay, and then, pick up the Cat Calendar from the floor of the cubicle. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. A typical kind of place.

You see a pan. The pan is usual. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You scan the room, seeing a bowl. The bowl is standard. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

There is an unblocked exit to the east.

AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go east
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Restroom =-
I am sorry to announce that you are now in the restroom. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You scan the room for a trunk, and you find a trunk. You see a counter! Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.
