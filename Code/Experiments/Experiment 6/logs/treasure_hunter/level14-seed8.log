Welcome to TextWorld! Here is how to play! First of all, look and see that the portal is ajar. And then, make an effort to head south. With that accomplished, ensure that the passageway is open. After that, make an effort to move east. Then, lift the nest of earwigs from the floor of the attic. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Recreation Zone =-
You find yourself in a recreation zone. A standard kind of place. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You make out a suitcase. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a locked locker close by. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a shelf. But the thing is empty.

There is a closed portal leading south. There is an open gateway leading west. There is an unguarded exit to the east.

-= Cubicle =-
You are in a cubicle. A standard one. The room is well lit.

You can see a safe. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You can make out a table. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is a closed passageway leading east. There is an open portal leading north. There is an open hatch leading west. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Attic =-
You've stumbled into an usual room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be usual. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the attic.

You make out a workbench. The workbench is typical. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is an open passageway leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

There is a nest of earwigs on the floor.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, let me think through this. The user is in the Attic, and there's a nest of earwigs on the floor. The goal was to lift the nest of earwigs from the floor of the attic. So the next logical step is to pick it up. The previous actions involved opening portals and passageways to get here. Now that they're in the attic, the immediate action is to lift the earwigs. The user hasn't done that yet, so the correct command should be "lift nest of earwigs".

Okay, the user is stuck in the Attic, trying to lift the nest of earwigs. They've tried "lift nest of earwigs" multiple times, but the game keeps saying it's not a recognized verb. Let me think about possible commands.

First, maybe the correct verb is "take" instead of "lift". In text adventures, "take" is commonly used for picking up items. The nest is on the floor, so perhaps the command should be "take nest of earwigs".

Alternatively, maybe the item is named differently. The game mentions a "nest of earwigs on the floor", so the exact phrasing might matter. Maybe "pick up" is the correct verb, but "pick up" isn't standard in many text games. Another possibility is "get" instead of "lift".

But the user has tried "lift" and it didn't work. Let me check the previous interactions. The user was told to "lift the nest of earwigs from the floor of the attic". The game might expect the verb "lift" but perhaps the object needs to be specified differently. Maybe "lift nest" without "of earwigs"? Or maybe "lift the nest of earwigs".

Wait, the user's previous attempt was "lift nest of earwigs", which the game rejected. Maybe the game expects "take" instead. Let me try that. The correct command is likely "take nest of earwigs". So the next action should be "take nest of earwigs".
