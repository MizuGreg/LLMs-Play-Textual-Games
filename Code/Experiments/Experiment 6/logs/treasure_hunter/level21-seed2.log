I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First off, try to head east. That done, travel north. Then, lift the passkey from the floor of the spare room. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Steam Room =-
You arrive in a steam room. A standard kind of place.

You see a box. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is typical. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is an unguarded exit to the east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

-= Laundry Place =-
You find yourself in a laundry place. A normal kind of place. You start to take note of what's in the room.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game called TextWorld. Their task is to first go east, then north, lift the passkey from the spare room's floor, and then stop. So far, they've entered the Steam Room, went east to the Laundry Place, and now they're in the Laundry Place.

The current room is the Laundry Place. The user is told that there's an unguarded exit to the north and west. The original goal was to go east, then north, then get the passkey from the spare room. Wait, but the user already went east from the Steam Room to get here. Now they're in the Laundry Place. The next step according to the initial instructions was to go north after going east. But in the Laundry Place, the user is told to try going north or west. 

Wait, maybe the initial instructions were to go east first, then north. But in the Steam Room, the user went east to the Laundry Place. Then, the next step would be to go north from the Laundry Place. But the user is now in the Laundry Place, and the prompt says "You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked." So the user has to decide whether to go north or west. 

But according to the original task, after going east (to Laundry Place), they need to go north. So from the Laundry Place, going north would be the next step. However, the user's current position is the Laundry Place, and the next action should be to go north. But the user might not have done that yet. Let me check the history again.

The user's first action was "go east" from the Steam Room, which took them to the Laundry Place. Then, the next step in the original task was to go north. So from the Laundry Place, going north would be the next step. However, the current prompt says that in the Laundry Place, the user is told to try going north or west. So the correct next action would be to go north. But the user hasn't done that yet. The user is now in the Laundry Place, and the next action should be to go north. Therefore, the correct command is "go north".
</think>go north

-= Spare Room =-
I never took you for the sort of person who would show up in a spare room, but I guess I was wrong.



There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

There is a passkey on the floor.

Okay, let's see. The user has been moving through different rooms in TextWorld. The original task was to go east, then north, lift the passkey from the spare room, and then stop. So far, they've gone east from the Steam Room into the Laundry Place, then north into the Spare Room.

In the Spare Room, there's a passkey on the floor. The user's next step should be to pick it up. The instructions say to lift the passkey from the floor of the spare room. So the correct action here is to pick it up. The user has to interact with the object, so the command would be "take passkey" or "lift passkey". But in TextWorld, the exact command might be "take passkey" since that's the standard verb for picking up items. Let me check the previous actions. The user was told to "lift the passkey from the floor of the spare room", so the correct command is "take passkey" or "lift passkey". The game might expect "take" as the verb. So the next action should be "take passkey".
</think>take passkey
