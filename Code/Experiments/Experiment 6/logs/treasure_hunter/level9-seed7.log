I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! First of all, take a trip north. And then, make an attempt to go to the west. And then, try to take a trip north. Then, take a trip east. And then, recover the key from the floor of the washroom. And if you do that, you're the winner!
