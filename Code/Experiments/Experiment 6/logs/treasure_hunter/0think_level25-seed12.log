Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, make an attempt to move east. After that, travel south. And then, try to move west. Then, make an effort to venture south. Then, make an attempt to go to the east. And then, move east. And then, go to the east. With that over with, try to venture south. If you can do that, try to travel south. Then, attempt to venture west. And then, recover the desktop computer from the floor of the austere workshop. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Studio =-
You've entered a studio.

You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. The table is typical. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You think about smashing the table to bits, throwing the bits into the garbage, etc, until you get bored. You can make out an armchair. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. This always happens!

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the south.
