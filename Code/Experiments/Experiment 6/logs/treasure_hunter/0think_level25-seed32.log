Welcome to TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First stop, try to travel west. After that, go west. And then, head north. With that over with, make an effort to go to the east. Next, retrieve the Microsoft latchkey from the floor of the bathroom. And then, make an attempt to go to the south. Then, unlock the Microsoft portal. After that, open the Microsoft portal. If you have pulled open the Microsoft portal, try to move south. With that over with, attempt to take a trip south. Once you accomplish that, pick-up the passkey from the floor of the kitchen. Got that? Good!

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

You arrive in a sauna. A standard kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a trunk, so there's that. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a board. The board is typical. The board appears to be empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Sauna =-
You arrive in a sauna. A standard kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a trunk, so there's that. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a board. The board is typical. The board appears to be empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked.
