Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First, it would be good if you could go north. With that accomplished, open the portal. After pulling open the portal, try to take a trip west. Then, venture north. And then, attempt to venture west. After that, venture west. Then, pick-up the chocolate bar from the floor of the workshop. That's it!

-= Study =-
You arrive in a study. An ordinary kind of place.

You can make out a stand. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.

-= Cookhouse =-
You arrive in a cookhouse. A standard kind of place.

You make out a chair. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is a closed portal leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game and has followed some instructions. The current location is the Cookhouse. The goal was to go north, open the portal, then go west, north, west again, pick up the chocolate bar.

First, in the Study, they went north to the Cookhouse. Now, in the Cookhouse, there's a closed portal leading west. The user is told to try going north or south. But the original plan was to go west after opening the portal. However, the portal is closed here. So maybe the next step is to open it. But how? The user might need to find a way to open the portal. The instructions mentioned pulling it open, so maybe "pull portal open" or "open portal" is the command. But the user's previous action was "go north", and now they're in the Cookhouse. The next step according to the initial plan was to open the portal. But the user hasn't done that yet. The current prompt says the portal is closed, so the user needs to open it first. The user's next action should be to open the portal. But the available commands here are going north or south. Wait, maybe the user needs to interact with the portal. The game might require using the correct verb. So the correct action here is to open the portal. But the user's previous action was "go north", and now they're in the Cookhouse. The next step is to open the portal. So the next command should be "open portal" or "pull portal open". The user's previous action was "go north", so now they need to open the portal. The user's next action should be to open the portal. But the game might require the exact command. Let me check the previous messages. The user was told to "open the portal" after going north. So the correct command here is "open portal". But in the current context, the portal is closed, so the user needs to open it. Therefore, the next action is to open the portal.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game, and they've been following a set of instructions. The original goal was to go north, open the portal, then go west, north again, west, west again, pick up the chocolate bar, and that's it.

So far, the user started in the Study, went north to the Cookhouse. Then they opened the portal. Now, the next step according to the original plan was to "try to take a trip west" after opening the portal. The current location is the Cookhouse, and there's a closed portal leading west. But the user just opened the portal, so maybe they need to go through it?

Wait, the prompt after opening the portal says "You open portal." Then the next instruction was to "try to take a trip west." So maybe the user needs to go west from the Cookhouse. But the Cookhouse's description says there's a closed portal leading west. But the user just opened it, so perhaps that's now unblocked. So the next action should be to go west.

But the user's last action was "open portal," and the current location is Cookhouse. The next step in the original plan was to go west. So the correct next command would be "go west." But I need to check the current environment. The Cookhouse's description says there's a closed portal leading west, but after opening it, maybe that's now accessible. So the user should go west through the portal. Therefore, the next action is "go west."

-= Lounge =-
You've just shown up in a lounge.

You see a bed. The bed appears to be empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the bed.

There is an open portal leading east. There is an open gate leading west. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north.

Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game where they have to navigate through different rooms and perform specific actions. The original goal was to go north, open the portal, go west, then north again, then west, pick up the chocolate bar, and that's it.

So far, the user has gone north from the study to the cookhouse, opened the portal, went west to the lounge. Now, in the lounge, there's an open portal east and an open gate west. The prompt says to try going north. The user's next action should be to go north. But wait, the current room is the lounge. The directions available are east, west, and north. The user needs to follow the sequence: after arriving in the lounge, they should venture north as per the original instructions. So the next command should be "go north".

GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Recreation Zone =-
You've moved into an ordinary room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be ordinary. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the recreation zone.

You can make out a bookshelf. The bookshelf is ordinary. But there isn't a thing on it. You can see a bar. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the bar.

There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.



>                                                                                                                                -= Recreation Zone =-0/5

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text adventure game, and they've been moving through different rooms. The original goal was to go north, open the portal, then go west, north again, west, then pick up the chocolate bar.

So far, they started in the Study, went north to the Cookhouse, opened the portal, went west to the Lounge, then north to the Recreation Zone. Now, in the Recreation Zone, the prompt says to try going west. The user's next action would be to go west. But wait, the current room is the Recreation Zone, and the options are south (unguarded) and west. The user has been following the path: after the Recreation Zone, the next step in the original plan was to venture west. So the correct next command is "go west". The assistant should output that.

-= Kitchenette =-
You've just walked into a kitchenette.

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a cabinet. You can make out a saucepan. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.



>                                                                                                                                -= Kitchenette =-0/6

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game where they have to navigate through different rooms and perform specific actions. The original goal was to go north, open the portal, go west, then north again, west, west, pick up the chocolate bar, and that's it.

So far, the user has gone north from the study to the cookhouse, opened the portal, went west to the lounge, then north to the recreation zone, then west to the kitchenette. Now, they're in the kitchenette. The next step according to the original plan was to go west again. But in the kitchenette description, there's an exit to the west that's unguarded. So the user should go west again. But wait, the current room is kitchenette, and the next step in the original plan was after going west from recreation zone to kitchenette, then the next action was to go west again? Wait, the original instructions said: after pulling open the portal, try to take a trip west. Then venture north. Then attempt to venture west. Then west again. Then pick up the chocolate bar.

Wait, let me check the original instructions again. The user said: "First, it would be good if you could go north. With that accomplished, open the portal. After pulling open the portal, try to take a trip west. Then, venture north. And then, attempt to venture west. After that, venture west. Then, pick-up the chocolate bar from the floor of the workshop. That's it!"

So the sequence is:

1. Go north (from study)
2. Open portal (in cookhouse)
3. Go west (to lounge)
4. Venture north (to recreation zone)
5. Attempt to venture west (to kitchenette)
6. Venture west (from kitchenette, which would be to another room, maybe the workshop?)
7. Pick up chocolate bar.

So in the current room, kitchenette, the next action should be to go west again. The user has already done steps 1-5. Now step 6 is to venture west from kitchenette. The kitchenette's description says there's an exit to the west. So the next command should be "go west" again. Then, after that, they should be in the workshop where the chocolate bar is. So the correct next action is go west.

-= Workshop =-
You are in a workshop. A standard kind of place. You begin looking for stuff.



There is an unguarded exit to the east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

There is a chocolate bar and a broccoli on the floor.


>                                                                                                                                -= Workshop =-0/7

Okay, let's see. The user's goal is to pick up the chocolate bar from the floor of the workshop. So far, they've navigated through several rooms: study, cookhouse, lounge, recreation zone, kitchenette, and now the workshop. The current room is the workshop, where the chocolate bar and broccoli are on the floor.

The user's next action should be to pick up the chocolate bar. But the game's commands might require using a specific verb like "take" or "pick up". Since the previous actions were mostly moving directions, the next logical step is to interact with the chocolate bar. The instruction says to only output the action, so the correct command here would be "take chocolate bar" or "pick up chocolate bar". However, looking at the previous interactions, the user has been using "go [direction]" commands. But in this case, since the chocolate bar is an object, the action needs to be different. The user might need to use "take" or "get". But the system might expect a specific command. Let me check the previous steps again.

In the workshop, the user is told there's a chocolate bar and broccoli on the floor. The user's last action was "go west", which led them to the workshop. Now, they need to pick up the chocolate bar. The correct command here is "take chocolate bar" or "get chocolate bar". However, in some text adventures, the command might be "take" followed by the item. Since the user has been using "go" for movement, but now they need to pick up an item, the correct action is "take chocolate bar". But I need to make sure that's the expected command here. Alternatively, maybe "pick up chocolate bar". But the user's previous actions were all "go" commands, so maybe the system expects "take" as the verb. Let me confirm. In the workshop, the user is told to "pick-up the chocolate bar from the floor of the workshop." So the correct action is "pick up chocolate bar". But the user's previous actions were "go north", "open portal", etc. So the next action should be "pick up chocolate bar". However, the system might require the exact command. Alternatively, maybe "take chocolate bar". But since the user's instruction says "pick-up the chocolate bar", the correct command is "pick up chocolate bar". But the user's previous actions were all movement commands. So the answer should be "take chocolate bar" or "pick up chocolate bar". Let me check the previous steps again. The user's last action was "go west" leading to the workshop. Now, the correct action is to pick up the chocolate bar. The system might expect "take chocolate bar" as the command. So the answer is "take chocolate bar".
