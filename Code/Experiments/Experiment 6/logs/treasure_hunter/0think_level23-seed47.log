I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is how to play! First of all, make an effort to move north. With that accomplished, make an attempt to venture north. Next, make an effort to head west. If you can do that, try to head west. With that over with, move south. With that over with, attempt to take a trip east. Then, recover the passkey from the board within the shower. Alright, thanks!

-= Chamber =-
I never took you for the sort of person who would show up in a chamber, but I guess I was wrong. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

What's that over there? It looks like it's a chest. The chest is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! What's that over there? It looks like it's a box. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. You see a recliner. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

-= Spare Room =-
You're now in the spare room. You begin looking for stuff.

Hey, want to see a toolbox? Look over there, a toolbox.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Of every study you could have walked into, you had to show up in an ordinary one.

-= Cubicle =-
I just think it's awesome that you're in a cubicle now. You start to take note of what's in the room.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

-= Basement =-
You are in a basement. An usual one. Let's see what's in here.

You see a rack. The rack is usual. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. You move on, clearly depressed by TextWorld.

There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an unguarded exit to the south.



>                                                                                                                                -= Basement =-0/5

-= Silent Studio =-
You arrive in a studio. A silent kind of place. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You make out a locked trunk. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a portmanteau. The portmanteau is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever!

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the north. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

-= Shower =-
You are in a shower. A standard kind of place.

You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a drawer. You can make out a basket. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? Oh, great. Here's a shelf. However, the shelf, like an empty shelf, has nothing on it. You move on, clearly done caring about your TextWorld experience. You see a board. You see a passkey on the board. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a bench. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is an unguarded exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.
