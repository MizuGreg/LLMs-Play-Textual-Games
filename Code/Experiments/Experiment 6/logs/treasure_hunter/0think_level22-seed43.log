I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! First of all, move south. Then, try to move south. Next, take a trip east. And then, try to travel east. Then, recover the tv from the floor of the salon. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Workshop =-
If you're wondering why everything seems so ordinary all of a sudden, it's because you've just shown up in the workshop.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.
