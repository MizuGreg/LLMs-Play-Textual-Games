You are now playing a exciting round of TextWorld! Here is how to play! Your first objective is to go east. Then, try to travel south. And then, try to travel south. With that accomplished, try to venture west. Then, lift the gummy bear from the floor of the chamber. Got that? Good!

-= Scullery =-
You find yourself in a scullery. A typical one. You can barely contain your excitement.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

-= Bathroom =-
You are in a bathroom. A typical kind of place.

You can make out a closed drawer. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a bench. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

There is an unguarded exit to the south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.



>                                                                                                                                -= Bathroom =-0/2
Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing a text-based game called TextWorld. Their goal is to go east, then south twice, then west, and lift a gummy bear.

So far, they started in the Scullery, went east to the Bathroom. Now they're in the Bathroom. The next steps according to the original plan are to go south twice, then west. But the user is asking if they're on the right track and what their next action should be.

In the Bathroom description, there's an unguarded exit to the south and west. The user has already gone east once (from Scullery to Bathroom). The next step in the original plan is to go south. So the user should go south from the Bathroom. The next action should be "go south". Then, after that, they need to go south again, then west, and then lift the gummy bear. But the user is asking for the next action now, so the answer is "go south".
</think>go south
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Study =-
Well I'll be, you are in a place we're calling a study. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a display.

There is an unguarded exit to the north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.



>                                                                                                                                -= Study =-0/3

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game called TextWorld. Their goal is to go east, then south twice, then west, and finally lift the gummy bear.

So far, they started in the Scullery, went east to the Bathroom, then south to the Study. Now they're in the Study. The next step according to the original plan is to go south again. The Study has an unguarded exit to the south, so that should be possible. The user needs to continue moving south to follow the path. The next action should be "go south" again. Let me check the room description again. Yes, the Study has an exit to the south. So the correct command is "go south".
</think>go south
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Cookhouse =-
Guess what, you are in the place we're calling the cookhouse.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.



>                                                                                                                                -= Cookhouse =-0/4

Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text adventure game, and their goal is to follow a specific path: go east, then south twice, then west, and finally pick up the gummy bear.

So far, the user has moved from the Scullery to the Bathroom, then to the Study, and now to the Cookhouse. The current room is the Cookhouse, and the directions mentioned are east, north, south (which is unguarded), and west (unblocked). The user's next step should be to go west, as per the original plan. The prompt says "you don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked." So the correct action here is to go west. I need to make sure that's the next command.
</think>go west
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Chamber =-
You've entered a chamber.

You make out a locker!

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

There is a gummy bear on the floor.


>                                                                                                                                -= Chamber =-0/5
Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-

Okay, let's see. The user has been moving through different rooms in the game: scullery, bathroom, study, cookhouse, and now the chamber. The original goal was to go east, then south twice, then west, and finally lift the gummy bear.

So far, the user has gone east from the scullery, then south to the bathroom, then south again to the study, then west to the cookhouse, and then west again to the chamber. Wait, the current room is the chamber. The next step according to the original plan was to venture west after going south twice. But in the chamber, the user needs to lift the gummy bear from the floor. The chamber has a gummy bear on the floor, so the next action should be to pick it up. But the user's last action was going west to the chamber. Now, in the chamber, the instruction says to lift the gummy bear. So the correct command here is to take the gummy bear. The user needs to say "take gummy bear" or something similar. But the game might require the exact phrase. Looking at the previous actions, the user has been using "go [direction]" commands. So maybe the correct action here is to pick it up, but the exact command might be "take gummy bear". However, the user's previous actions were all "go" commands. The current room has the gummy bear on the floor, so the next step is to pick it up. Therefore, the correct command is "take gummy bear".
</think>take gummy bear
