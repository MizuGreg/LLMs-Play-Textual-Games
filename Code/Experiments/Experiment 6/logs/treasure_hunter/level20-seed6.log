Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First stop, attempt to go west. Following that, go west. Next, recover the chocolate bar from the floor of the workshop. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Recreation Zone =-
You've moved into an ordinary room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be ordinary. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the recreation zone.

You can make out a bookshelf. The bookshelf is ordinary. But there isn't a thing on it. You can see a bar. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the bar.

There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

-= Kitchenette =-
You've just walked into a kitchenette.

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a cabinet. You can make out a saucepan. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they need to go west twice and then recover a chocolate bar from the workshop. So far, they've gone west from the Recreation Zone into the Kitchenette. The current room is the Kitchenette, which has a cabinet, a saucepan, and exits to the east and west.

The user is asking if they're making the right moves and if they're close to the goal. The original task was to go west twice, then get the chocolate bar. They've already done the first west move. Now, they're in the Kitchenette. The next step would be to go west again from here. The exit to the west is unguarded, so that's doable. 

But wait, the user mentioned the chocolate bar is in the workshop. So maybe after going west twice, they'll reach the workshop. But the current room is the Kitchenette. Let me check the previous steps again. The first move was west from Recreation Zone to Kitchenette. The next move should be west again from Kitchenette. That would take them to another room, possibly the workshop. But the user hasn't found the chocolate bar yet. So the next action should be to go west again. Then, once they reach the workshop, they can look for the chocolate bar on the floor. 

The user is asking if they're on the right track. Since they've gone west once, and the next step is to go west again, that's correct. Then, after reaching the workshop, they can retrieve the chocolate. So the next command should be "go west" again.
</think>go west

-= Workshop =-
You are in a workshop. A standard kind of place. You begin looking for stuff.



There is an unguarded exit to the east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

There is a chocolate bar and a broccoli on the floor.


>                                                                                                                                -= Workshop =-0/3

Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they need to go west twice and then recover the chocolate bar from the workshop floor. So far, they've gone west from the Recreation Zone into the Kitchenette, then west again into the Workshop. Now, in the Workshop, they see a chocolate bar on the floor.

The original goal was to go west twice and then get the chocolate. The user has already done the first two west moves. Now, they need to pick up the chocolate bar. But the game's current prompt says there's a chocolate bar and broccoli on the floor. So the next step should be to pick up the chocolate bar.

But the user's last action was "go west", which took them to the Workshop. Now, they need to pick up the chocolate. The command should be "take chocolate bar" or something similar. However, in some text games, you might need to use "get" instead of "take". But since the user's previous actions were "go west", maybe the correct command here is "take chocolate bar".

Wait, the user's instruction said to "recover the chocolate bar from the floor of the workshop". So the correct action is to pick it up. The game's current state shows the chocolate is on the floor, so the next command should be to take it. The user needs to input "take chocolate bar" or "get chocolate bar". But in the previous steps, the user just moved, so maybe the correct command here is "take chocolate bar".

But the user's previous responses were just "go west", so maybe they need to use "take" now. The assistant should output "take chocolate bar" as the next action.
</think>take chocolate bar
