Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Your task for today is to recover the teaspoon from the floor of the cookhouse.

-= Cookhouse =-
You arrive in a standard kind of place. That is to say, you're in a cookhouse.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a teaspoon on the floor.

-= Sauna =-
You find yourself in a sauna.



There is a closed portal leading west. There is an open door leading east. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me think through this. The user is in a text-based game where they need to recover the teaspoon from the cookhouse. So far, they've gone north from the sauna, which brought them back to the cookhouse. The teaspoon is still on the floor here.

The current location is the cookhouse again. The user has already been here before, and the teaspoon is still present. The previous attempts were going north and then south, which just looped back. The goal is to pick up the teaspoon. 

Looking at the description, the cookhouse has an unguarded exit to the north and west. The user needs to pick up the teaspoon, which is on the floor. Since the user hasn't picked it up yet, the next logical step is to pick it up. The game might require them to pick it up once they're in the correct location. 

The user's last action was going south, which brought them back to the cookhouse. Now, they need to pick up the teaspoon. The command should be to pick up the teaspoon. The game might not allow moving unless the teaspoon is picked up, or maybe after picking it up, they can exit. But the main task is to get the teaspoon. So the next action should be to pick up the teaspoon.
</think>pick up teaspoon
