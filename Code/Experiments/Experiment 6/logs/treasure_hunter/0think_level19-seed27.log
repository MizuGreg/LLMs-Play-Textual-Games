Welcome to TextWorld! Here is your task for today. Your first objective is to go to the east. If you can finish that, doublecheck that the wooden hatch within the salon is opened. And then, make an effort to go to the east. Then, open the portal inside the scullery. After that, go to the north. Then, attempt to take a trip west. Then, open the passageway. After opening the passageway, attempt to travel west. Then, recover the shadfly from the floor of the spare room. That's it!

-= Cubicle =-
You find yourself in a cubicle. An ordinary one.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked.

Well how about that, you are in the place we're calling the salon. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You see an opened suitcase nearby. The suitcase is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a bed stand. The bed stand is usual. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

There is a closed wooden hatch leading east. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

Well how about that, you are in the place we're calling the salon. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You see an opened suitcase nearby. The suitcase is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a bed stand. The bed stand is usual. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

There is a closed wooden hatch leading east. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

Well how about that, you are in the place we're calling the salon. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You see an opened suitcase nearby. The suitcase is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a bed stand. The bed stand is usual. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

There is a closed wooden hatch leading east. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

You find yourself in a cubicle. An ordinary one.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Salon =-
Well how about that, you are in the place we're calling the salon. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You see an opened suitcase nearby. The suitcase is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a bed stand. The bed stand is usual. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

There is a closed wooden hatch leading east. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.
