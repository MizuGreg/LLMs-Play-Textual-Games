Welcome to another exciting episode of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First stop, take a trip west. Then, head north. If you can succeed at that, venture north. After that, attempt to venture east. And then, travel south. If you can succeed at that, pick-up the American latchkey from the floor of the studio. With the American latchkey, make an attempt to go south. And then, unlock the American gate with the American latchkey. Then, make it so that the American gate within the cubicle is ajar. After opening the American gate, make an attempt to go east. Then, travel east. After that, lift the keycard from the floor of the workshop. And if you do that, you're the winner!

You are in a cubicle. It seems to be pretty standard here. You start to take note of what's in the room.



There is a closed American gate leading east. There is an unguarded exit to the north. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game and has already taken the first step west from the cubicle into the bedchamber. The goal mentioned earlier was to follow a specific sequence of movements and collect items to unlock gates and win.

So, the current location is the bedchamber. The user has already gone west from the cubicle, which was the first step. The next steps in the original instructions were to go north, then north again, then east, then south. But the user is now in the bedchamber. Let me check the environment again.

In the bedchamber, there's an exit to the east and an exit to the north, both unguarded. The user's next action should be to go north, as per the initial plan. But wait, the user is asking if they're on the right track and if they're close to the goal. The user's previous action was going west, which was the first step. Now, in the bedchamber, the next step according to the original plan was to go north. So the next command should be "go north" again. But the user is asking for the next action, so after going north from the bedchamber, they would be in another room. Let me make sure that the steps are followed correctly. The original plan was: go west, then north, then north, then east, then south. So after the first step (west), the next is north. So the next action is indeed "go north".

I am sorry to announce that you are now in the spare room.

You make out a workbench. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The workbench is typical. However, the workbench, like an empty workbench, has nothing on it. You see a stand. The stand is ordinary. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game and has followed the steps given in the initial instructions. The goal is to pick up the American latchkey from the studio, unlock the American gate, and then proceed to the workshop to get the keycard.

So far, the user has gone west from the cubicle into the bedchamber, then north to the spare room. Now, in the spare room, there's an exit to the east and south. The user is being prompted to decide whether they're on the right track and what their next move should be.

Looking at the environment, the spare room has a workbench and a stand, but nothing of interest. The exits are east and south. The original plan was to go west, north, then north again, east, south to get the latchkey. But the user is now in the spare room. The next step according to the initial instructions was to venture north again after going west, then east, then south. But in the current room, the user can go east or south. 

Wait, the user's previous steps were: cubicle -> west (bedchamber) -> north (spare room). The next step in the original plan was to go north again from the cubicle, but the user already went west and then north. Maybe the user is supposed to go south from the spare room to return to the cubicle? But the initial plan was to go north, then north again, then east, then south. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go east from the spare room. But the original plan mentioned going east after going north from the cubicle. Wait, the initial instructions said: after going north from the cubicle, venture north again, then east, then south. But in the current room (spare room), the user can go east or south. If the user goes south, they'd return to the cubicle. But the cubicle's exit to the south is blocked by the American gate. Wait, no, the cubicle has an exit to the south? Wait, the cubicle's description says there's a closed American gate leading east, and unguarded exits to north and west. So the cubicle's south exit is not mentioned. So maybe the user is in the spare room, and the next step is to go south back to the cubicle, then proceed north again? But the original plan was to go north from the cubicle, then north again, then east, then south. But the user is now in the spare room. Maybe the user needs to go east from the spare room to proceed further. But the original plan said after going north from the cubicle, venture north again. But the user is already in the spare room, which is north of the cubicle. So maybe the next step is to go north again from the spare room? But the spare room's north exit is not mentioned. Wait, the spare room's description says there's an exit to the east and south. So the user can't go north from here. So maybe the user needs to go east from the spare room. But why? The original plan said after going north from the cubicle, venture north again. But the user is in the spare room, which is north of the cubicle. So perhaps the next step is to go east from the spare room to proceed towards the studio where the latchkey is. But the initial instructions said to go west, north, north, east, south. So maybe the user is supposed to go east from the spare room. But the user is at the spare room, which is north of the cubicle. So going east from the spare room would take them to the next room. But the original plan was to go north again from the cubicle, but the user already went west and then north. Maybe the user is supposed to go east from the spare room to reach the studio. But the initial instructions mention going east after going north from the cubicle. So perhaps the user is on the right track. The next action would be to go east from the spare room. But the user is in the spare room, and the exit to the east is unguarded. So the next command should be "go east".

-= Studio =-
You are in a studio. An usual one.



There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

There is a loaf of bread and an American latchkey on the floor.

<think>
Okay, let me figure out what to do next. The user has been following the instructions to move west, north, then north again, east, and now they're in the Studio. The goal was to pick up the American latchkey from the floor of the studio. The user just arrived here, and the studio has a loaf of bread and the American latchkey on the floor.

So the next step according to the original plan was to pick up the American latchkey. The user's previous action was going east to reach the studio. Now, they need to pick up the latchkey. The instruction says to pick it up from the floor. So the correct command here would be to take the American latchkey. 

Wait, but in TextWorld, sometimes you have to use specific commands like 'take' or 'get'. The user's previous actions were all 'go' commands. But in this room, the latchkey is on the floor, so the appropriate action is to pick it up. The user hasn't done that yet. So the next action should be to take the American latchkey. 

Let me check the previous steps again. The user was told to "pick-up the American latchkey from the floor of the studio." So the command here would be 'take American latchkey' or 'get American latchkey'. But the user's history shows that they have to use the exact command. Since the game is TextWorld, the correct command is likely 'take American latchkey'. 

But the user's previous actions were all 'go' commands. However, in this room, the latchkey is an item on the floor, so the next step is to pick it up. Therefore, the correct next action is to take the American latchkey.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the instructions step by step. They started by going west, then north, then east, and now they're in the Studio. They picked up the American latchkey. The next step according to the original goal was to use the latchkey to unlock the American gate in the cubicle. But wait, the user is in the Studio now. So they need to go back to the cubicle, unlock the gate, and then proceed.

But the current room is the Studio. The exits here are north, south, and west. The original plan was to go south from the Studio to the Spare Room, but the user might need to go back to the cubicle. Wait, the initial steps mentioned going west from the cubicle, then north, then north again, then east, then south to pick up the latchkey. Now, with the latchkey, they need to go back to the cubicle's American gate.

So the next action should be to go south from the Studio back to the Spare Room, then west to the Bedchamber, then west again to the Cubicle. Once back in the Cubicle, they can use the latchkey on the American gate. Then, after unlocking it, they can go east through the gate. Then, proceed to the Workshop to lift the keycard.

But the user is in the Studio. The next step after picking up the latchkey is to go back to the cubicle. So from the Studio, go south to the Spare Room (since the Studio's south exit is unguarded). Then west to the Bedchamber, then west again to the Cubicle. Once there, use the latchkey on the gate. Then proceed east through the unlocked gate. Then go east to the Workshop. So the immediate next action is to go south from the Studio.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps given in the initial instructions. They started by going west, then north, then east, then south. Now they're back in the cubicle. The goal was to pick up the American latchkey from the studio, use it to unlock the American gate, then proceed further.

In the current scene, the user is in the cubicle again. The American gate leading east is closed. The previous step was going south from the studio, which brought them back to the cubicle. Now, they need to unlock the American gate with the latchkey they picked up. So the next logical step is to try unlocking the gate. The command should be "unlock American gate" or something similar. But the game might expect a specific phrase. Since the user has the latchkey, they should use it on the gate. The correct action here is to attempt to unlock the gate with the latchkey. So the next command should be "unlock American gate with American latchkey" or just "unlock American gate". But looking at the previous interactions, the user was told to "unlock the American gate with the American latchkey" so maybe the exact command is "unlock American gate". Let me check the previous steps. The user was instructed to "unlock the American gate with the American latchkey". So the correct command here is "unlock American gate".

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps given in the initial instructions. They started by going west, then north, east, and south, picking up the American latchkey in the Studio. Then they went back south to the Cubicle, unlocked the American gate. Now, the next step according to the original plan was to make the American gate within the cubicle ajar, which they just did. Then they needed to attempt to go east, travel east, lift the keycard from the workshop, and then win.

Wait, after unlocking the gate, the next action should be to go east through the American gate. The current location is the Cubicle, and the American gate leading east is now unlocked. So the next command should be "go east" to move into the next area. Then, after going east, they would enter a new room, possibly the Workshop, where they can pick up the keycard. Then, with the keycard, they can proceed further. So the immediate next step is to go east through the unlocked gate.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to progress through the game. They've already unlocked the American gate with the latchkey. The current location is the Cubicle, and the American gate leading east is now unlocked. The previous attempt to go east failed because the gate wasn't open. So, the next logical step is to open the gate again. Wait, but they just unlocked it. Maybe the game requires them to open it again? Or perhaps there's a typo in the message. The user has the latchkey, so they should be able to open the gate. The correct action here is to go east again after ensuring the gate is open. The previous message said "You unlock American gate," so the gate should be open now. The error message says they need to open it first, but they already did. Maybe the game is expecting the "open" command instead of "go east." But the user's last action was "go east," which was blocked. So, perhaps the correct command is "open American gate" again, but the user already did that. Alternatively, maybe the gate is closed again, so they need to unlock it again. But they have the key. Hmm. The user's next action should be to go east again, but the game is blocking it. Maybe the correct command is "open American gate" again, but the user already unlocked it. Wait, maybe the game is expecting the "go east" command after opening. Since the user has the key and the gate is unlocked, the next step is to go east. The error message might be a mistake. So, the correct action is "go east."

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to progress through the game. They've already unlocked the American gate with the latchkey, but when they try to go east, the game says they need to open the gate first. Wait, maybe the gate is still closed even after unlocking? Or perhaps there's a step I'm missing.

Looking back at the previous steps: The user was in the Cubicle, tried to go east, but the American gate was closed. They picked up the latchkey in the Studio, then went back to the Cubicle, unlocked the gate, but maybe the gate isn't fully open yet? The game message says "You unlock American gate," but maybe that's just a confirmation, and the actual opening is required. Or maybe the gate needs to be opened manually after unlocking. Wait, the original instruction said to "make it so that the American gate within the cubicle is ajar." So perhaps after unlocking, they need to open it again? Or maybe the gate is locked and needs to be opened with the latchkey, but the game is indicating that the gate is still closed even after unlocking. Hmm. The user tried to go east again, but the game says they have to open the gate first. So maybe the gate is still closed, and they need to open it again. But how? The latchkey was used to unlock it. Maybe the game is expecting them to use the latchkey again to open it. Wait, but the user already used it to unlock. Maybe the game is in a state where the gate is unlocked but not open, so they need to open it manually. But in the game's context, maybe "unlock" and "open" are different actions. Or perhaps the user needs to use the latchkey again to open it. Let me check the previous steps again.

The user had the latchkey, went to the Cubicle, unlocked the gate, but then tried to go east and the game said they had to open the gate first. So maybe the gate is unlocked but not open, so they need to open it. But how? Maybe the correct action is to open the gate with the latchkey again. But the game might have a specific command for that. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the latchkey to open it. Wait, the original instruction said to "unlock the American gate with the American latchkey" and then "make it so that the American gate within the cubicle is ajar." So perhaps after unlocking, they need to open it. But the game's response is that they have to open the gate first. So the user is at the Cubicle, with the gate unlocked but not open. The next step would be to open the gate. But how? Maybe the correct command is "open American gate" or "use American latchkey on American gate." But the game might expect a specific command. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go through the gate. But the game says they have to open it first. So the user is stuck here. The next action should be to open the gate again. But the user already used the latchkey to unlock it. Maybe the game is expecting the user to use the latchkey again to open it. So the next command should be "open American gate" or "use American latchkey on American gate." But the game might have a specific command. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east again after opening it. But the game is preventing that. So the correct action here is to open the gate. But how? The user has the latchkey. So the next step is to open the gate with the latchkey. Therefore, the next command should be "open American gate" or "use American latchkey on American gate." But the game might accept "open American gate" as the command. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the latchkey again. But the game might not have that command. So the correct action here is to open the gate. Therefore, the next command is "open American gate."

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to progress through the game according to the instructions given. They started by going west, then north, east, south, and picked up the American latchkey. Then they tried to unlock the American gate, which they did. Now they've opened the gate and are in the Cubicle again.

The next step in the original goal was to "make it so that the American gate within the cubicle is ajar." They just opened it, so maybe they need to check if that's done. But the game might require them to move through the gate. The user tried going east again but was told they need to open the gate first. After opening it, they can proceed.

Since the gate is now open, the next logical step would be to go through it east. But the previous attempt to go east failed because the gate wasn't open. Now that it's open, they should try going east again. The command would be "go east" to move into the next area. The user might need to continue following the steps mentioned in the initial instructions, which include moving east from the workshop after picking up the keycard. But since they're in the Cubicle now, after opening the gate, going east would take them to the next room, possibly the Workshop. Then they need to pick up the keycard and proceed. So the next action is definitely "go east".

Now, in the laundromat, there's an open American gate west and an open wooden passageway east. The next step would be to check if the wooden passageway east leads to the workshop where the keycard is. The user needs to go east from here. Since the passageway is open, they can just "go east" again. That makes sense because the previous steps involved moving east multiple times. The keycard is in the workshop, so moving east from the laundromat should lead there. The user's next action should be to go east.
</think>go east

Well, here we are in a workshop. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.



There is an open pine door leading east. There is an open wooden passageway leading west. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north.

There is a keycard on the floor.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps given in the initial instructions. They started by going west, then north, east, south, and so on. They picked up the American latchkey in the Studio, used it to unlock the gate, and then went east to the Laundromat. Now they're in the Workshop, and the next step according to the original plan was to pick up the keycard from the floor of the workshop. The user has to lift the keycard, which is on the floor here. Once they have the keycard, they should be able to proceed further. The current room is the Workshop, and the keycard is present. So the next action should be to take the keycard. Let me check the previous steps again to make sure. Yes, the original goal mentioned picking up the keycard from the workshop after opening the American gate. So the correct command here is to take the keycard.
</think>take keycard
