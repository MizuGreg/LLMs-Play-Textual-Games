I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is how to play! First step, go west. With that over with, travel north. Then, make an effort to go north. With that accomplished, head west. After that, attempt to venture west. And then, move south. Once you accomplish that, try to venture south. Then, make an attempt to venture east. Okay, and then, retrieve the stick of butter from the floor of the bathroom. That's it!

-= Cookhouse =-
You've just walked into a cookhouse. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You see a platter. The platter appears to be empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the platter.

There is an open gate leading north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. There is an unblocked exit to the south. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

-= Shower =-
You are in a shower. A standard kind of place. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. The counter is standard. The counter appears to be empty.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

Well I'll be, you are in a place we're calling a bathroom.

As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a case. Classic TextWorld. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this?

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

There is a stick of butter on the floor.
