Welcome to TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, try to move south. And then, go to the west. With that accomplished, retrieve the sandwich from the floor of the closet. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Recreation Zone =-
Guess what, you are in a place we're calling a recreation zone.



There is an unblocked exit to the north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

-= Kitchenette =-
Well I'll be, you are in the place we're calling the kitchenette.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Closet =-
You are in a closet. A normal kind of place. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

There is a sandwich on the floor.
