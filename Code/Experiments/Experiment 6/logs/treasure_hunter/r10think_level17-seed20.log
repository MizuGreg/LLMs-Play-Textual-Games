Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an life changing round of TextWorld? You do! First off, make an attempt to go to the east. Then, open the gate. After that, make an attempt to venture north. Once you succeed at that, go to the west. With that accomplished, move north. With that over with, make an attempt to go to the north. Then, recover the loaf of bread from the floor of the launderette. Alright, thanks!

-= Salon =-
You arrive in a salon. A normal one. You begin looking for stuff.

You can see a trunk. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a bench. You shudder, but continue examining the bench. The bench is standard. The bench appears to be empty.

There is an open door leading east. There is an open hatch leading west.

There is a fondue on the floor.
