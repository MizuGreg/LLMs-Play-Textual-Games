Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First step, travel south. Once you manage that, try to take a trip west. If you can manage that, try to take a trip south. And then, try to head west. Then, head south. And then, head east. Then, make an attempt to go to the east. And then, attempt to head north. With that done, pick up the passkey from the floor of the spare room. Got that? Good!

You've just shown up in a laundromat.



There is an open portal leading east. There is an open gate leading south.

You arrive in a bar. A standard one.

You can make out a recliner. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.

There is an open gate leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game set in a laundromat and a bar. The goal is to navigate through the locations, follow specific directions, and eventually pick up the passkey from the spare room.

First, the user started by going south from the laundromat into the bar. The current location is the bar. The prompt mentions that the user needs to travel south, then west, then south again, west, south, east, east again, and north. Then pick up the passkey from the spare room.

In the bar, the available directions are north (through an open gate), east (unblocked entranceway), south (exit to the west), and west (unblocked exit). The user's next steps should follow the initial instructions: after arriving in the bar, the next step was to try to take a trip west. Wait, the initial instructions said after going south (from laundromat to bar), then try to go west. But in the bar, the west exit is unblocked. So the next action should be to go west from the bar.

But the user's previous action was going south from the laundromat to the bar. Now, in the bar, the next step according to the initial plan is to go west. So the correct next command is "go west". The user needs to follow the sequence: south (to bar), west, then south again, west, south, east, east, north, then pick up the passkey.

So the next action is "go west".

-= Bedchamber =-
You've entered a bedchamber.

You scan the room, seeing a bed. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a bed? But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. You can see a couch. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The couch appears to be empty. Hm. Oh well

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. There is an unblocked exit to the south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in TextWorld. The original goal was to pick up the passkey from the floor of the spare room. So far, they've gone south from the laundromat into a bar, then west to the bedchamber. Now, they're in the bedchamber, and the available exits are east, south, and west.

The user's next action should be to continue exploring towards the spare room. The original path mentioned going south, then west, then south again, then east, then north. But currently, they're in the bedchamber. The next step might be to go south from the bedchamber to check if that leads closer to the spare room. Alternatively, maybe east or west. But the original plan was to go west, then south. Wait, the initial instructions said: first step, travel south (which they did), then try to take a trip west (they did that to get to the bedchamber). Then, try to take a trip south again. So from the bedchamber, going south would be the next step. Let me check the current room's exits. The bedchamber has exits to east, south, and west. So going south from here would be the next logical step according to the original plan. That would take them to the next room, perhaps the spare room or another area. So the next action should be 'go south'.

-= Workshop =-
You've entered a workshop.

Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a cabinet. You see a mantelpiece. The mantelpiece is usual. But there isn't a thing on it. You move on, clearly angry about TextWorld.

There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

Okay, let's see. The user has been moving through different rooms in TextWorld: starting in the Laundromat, then the Bar, Bedchamber, and now the Workshop. The original task was to navigate through specific directions and then pick up the passkey from the spare room.

So far, the user has gone south from Laundromat to Bar, then west to Bedchamber, then south to Workshop. The next steps in the original task were to go west, then south, then east, then north. But the user is currently in the Workshop. Let me check the directions available here. The Workshop has exits to east, north, and south, and west is unblocked. 

Wait, the user's last action was "go south" to reach the Workshop. Now, according to the original plan, after reaching the Workshop, the next steps were to go west, then south, then east, then north. But the Workshop's exits include west. So maybe the next step is to go west from the Workshop. However, the user might need to check if the passkey is in the spare room, which might be accessible through these movements. 

But the current room is Workshop. The user needs to follow the path as per the original instructions. The next step in the original task after Workshop would be to go west. So the correct next action here is "go west" to proceed further. Then, after that, go south, east, north, and finally pick up the passkey. 

So the answer should be "go west".

-= Scullery =-
You arrive in a scullery. A typical kind of place. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You can make out a freezer.

There is an unguarded exit to the east. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

Okay, let's see. The user is navigating through different rooms in TextWorld, following a specific path. The original goal was to pick up the passkey from the spare room. So far, they've gone south from the laundromat to the bar, then west to the bedchamber, south again to the workshop, and west to the scullery.

Now, in the scullery, the available exits are east, north, and south. The user's next move should be to continue following the path that leads towards the spare room. The original instructions mentioned going east, then south, then east, then north. But the current room is the scullery. The user needs to check which direction leads towards the spare room.

The scullery has an unguarded exit to the east, north, and south. The user's previous moves were west, so maybe the next step is to go north or east. But the original plan was to go east from the workshop, then south, etc. Wait, the user is in the scullery now. The spare room might be in a different part of the map. Since the user hasn't found the passkey yet, they need to continue exploring.

Looking at the scullery's description, there's a freezer. Maybe the passkey is in the freezer? Or perhaps the next room is the spare room. The user should check the exits. The user's next action should be to go north, as per the original plan, but need to confirm. Alternatively, maybe going east from the scullery leads to the next room. However, the user's previous steps were moving west, so maybe the next step is to go north to continue the path. Alternatively, the user might need to go south from the scullery to reach the workshop again, but that's already been visited.

Wait, the original task was to go south, then west, then south, then west, then south, then east, then east, then north. So after the scullery, the next step would be to go north, as per the original plan. So the user should go north from the scullery. But the user needs to check if that's the correct direction. The scullery's exits are east, north, south. The user's next move is to go north, which would take them to the next room. Then, after that, they can proceed as per the original plan. So the next action is go north.

You've just walked into a kitchen.

You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a table. The table is ordinary. The table appears to be empty.

There is an unguarded exit to the east. There is an unblocked exit to the south. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

The next step in the original plan was after getting to the Kitchen to go east, then east again, then north. But the user hasn't done that yet. The current room is the Kitchen, and the exits are east, south, and west. The user's next action should follow the original plan: after the Kitchen, go east, then east again, then north.

Okay, let's see. The user is navigating through different rooms in TextWorld, following a specific path. The goal is to eventually pick up the passkey from the spare room. So far, they've gone south from the laundromat to the bar, then west to the bedchamber, south to the workshop, west to the scullery, north to the kitchen, and east back to the bedchamber.

Now, the current room is the bedchamber again. The user's next action should be to continue moving towards the spare room. The original task mentioned going south, then west, then south again, then east, then north. But the user has already done some of these steps. The passkey is in the spare room, which hasn't been mentioned yet. 

Looking at the current room (bedchamber), the exits are east, south, and west. The user needs to find the path to the spare room. Since the previous steps led them through the workshop, scullery, kitchen, and back to the bedchamber, maybe the spare room is connected via the south exit from the bedchamber. Alternatively, maybe the workshop or kitchen has a passage to the spare room. But the user hasn't checked those areas yet.

Wait, the original task said after going east, then north, then attempt to go north again. But in the current state, the user is in the bedchamber. The next logical step might be to go south from the bedchamber to reach the workshop again, then check if there's a path to the spare room. Alternatively, maybe the spare room is connected via the east exit from the bedchamber. But the user has already been there. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west from the bedchamber to the scullery again, then north to the kitchen, then east to the bedchamber again. But that seems like going in circles. The key is to find the spare room. Since the passkey is in the spare room, the user needs to find that room. The path might involve going south from the bedchamber to the workshop, then west to the scullery, then north to the kitchen, then east to the bedchamber again, but that doesn't seem right. 

Wait, maybe the spare room is connected via the south exit from the workshop. The user was in the workshop, then went west to the scullery. Maybe from the workshop, going south leads to the spare room. But the user hasn't checked that yet. Alternatively, the spare room could be in the kitchen. But the user hasn't found it yet. 

Since the user is in the bedchamber, the next step should be to check the south exit. The original task mentioned going south again. So the user should go south from the bedchamber to the workshop, then check if there's a path to the spare room. Alternatively, maybe the spare room is connected via the east exit from the bedchamber. But the user has already been there. 

The user's next action should be to go south from the bedchamber to the workshop again, then check the south exit from the workshop. That might lead to the spare room. So the correct next command is "go south".

So far, they've moved through the laundromat, bar, bedchamber, workshop, scullery, kitchen, and back to the bedchamber and workshop. The current room is the workshop again.

The user's next action should be to continue moving towards the spare room. The workshop has exits to the east, north, south, and west. The original path mentioned going west, then south, then east, then north. But the user is now in the workshop again, possibly looping. The spare room might be in a different direction. Since the user needs to find the passkey, maybe they need to check all possible directions. But the previous steps have been moving south, west, etc. Maybe the spare room is in the north or east direction from the workshop. The user should try moving north from the workshop. The previous step was going south, so moving north would take them back. But maybe that's necessary to find the correct path. Alternatively, maybe the spare room is in the east. But the user needs to check. Since the user's goal is to pick up the passkey, they need to find the correct room.

So now, the user is back in the workshop. The next step should be to go east from the workshop. But the user's previous action was going south to the workshop. So the next step is to go east. But the user might need to check all directions. However, the user's goal is to find the passkey in the spare room. The spare room is likely in a specific location. Since the user has been moving around, maybe the next step is to go north from the workshop. But the user needs to find the correct path.

Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is in a text-based game called TextWorld, and their task is to navigate through different rooms and eventually pick up the passkey from the spare room. So far, they've been moving around various rooms like the laundromat, bar, bedchamber, workshop, scullery, kitchen, and back to the bedchamber and workshop again. Now they're in the Spare Room, which has the passkey on the floor.

The user's last action was "go east", which led them to the Spare Room. The current room description mentions the passkey is on the floor. The goal is to pick up the passkey. Since the user is in the Spare Room, the next logical step would be to pick up the passkey. The instruction says to pick it up from the floor of the spare room. So the correct command here is "take passkey" or "get passkey". But in the game's context, the command might be "take passkey" or "pick up passkey". However, looking at the previous commands, the user has been using "go [direction]" commands. But once they're in the room where the passkey is, they need to pick it up. The game's interface might require the exact command to pick it up. Since the passkey is on the floor, the correct action is to take it. So the answer should be "take passkey".
