Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First step, travel south. Once you manage that, try to take a trip west. If you can manage that, try to take a trip south. And then, try to head west. Then, head south. And then, head east. Then, make an attempt to go to the east. And then, attempt to head north. With that done, pick up the passkey from the floor of the spare room. Got that? Good!

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this TextWorld game and has been moving around different rooms. The task was to navigate through specific directions and then pick up the passkey from the spare room. So far, they've been moving south, west, east, north, and back again, looping between rooms.

Looking at the current location, they're in the Kitchen again. The previous steps have them moving in a cycle between the Kitchen, Bedchamber, Workshop, Scullery, and back. The goal is to find the passkey in the spare room. But the user hasn't mentioned finding any items yet. The instructions said to pick up the passkey from the floor of the spare room. 

Wait, the user hasn't checked the spare room yet. The path to the spare room might be through the Workshop or another room. The current location is the Kitchen, which has exits to east, south, and west. The Workshop was earlier in the path, but maybe the spare room is connected there. However, in the previous steps, the user hasn't explored the Workshop's north exit, which was mentioned as unguarded. 

Alternatively, maybe the spare room is part of the Workshop. But the user hasn't checked the Workshop's north exit yet. The user's last action was going north from the Scullery to the Kitchen. So, perhaps they need to go back to the Workshop and check the north exit. But the user is currently in the Kitchen. The exits from the Kitchen are east (Bedchamber), south (Scullery), and west (Bedchamber again). Wait, the Kitchen's exits are east, south, and west. So maybe the Workshop is not directly connected here. 

Wait, the user's path has them looping between the Kitchen, Bedchamber, Workshop, Scullery. The spare room hasn't been mentioned yet. The original task was to go south, then west, then south, west, south, east, east, north, and then pick up the passkey. But maybe the spare room is in a different part. Alternatively, maybe the user hasn't checked the rooms properly. 

Alternatively, maybe the passkey is in the Workshop. The Workshop has a mantelpiece, but nothing on it. The user hasn't checked the Workshop's north exit yet. The user is in the Kitchen, so maybe they need to go back to the Workshop via the east exit (Bedchamber) and then check the north exit. But the user hasn't done that yet. 

Alternatively, maybe the spare room is the Workshop. But the user hasn't checked the floor of the Workshop. The original task says to pick up the passkey from the floor of the spare room. So the user needs to find the spare room and check the floor. 

But the user hasn't reached the spare room yet. The current path is looping, so maybe they need to find a different route. The user's next step should be to check the Workshop's north exit, which was mentioned as unguarded. So from the Kitchen, go east to Bedchamber, then east again to Workshop, then north to check the spare room. But the user is in the Kitchen, so the next step would be to go east to Bedchamber, then east again to Workshop, then north. But the user hasn't done that yet. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is stuck in a loop and needs to find a different path. The user's next action should be to go east from the Kitchen to Bedchamber, then east again to Workshop, then north to check the spare room. But the user is in the Kitchen, so the next command is "go east" to Bedchamber. Then from Bedchamber, "go east" to Workshop. Then from Workshop, "go north" to the spare room. Then check the floor for the passkey. 

But the user hasn't done that yet. The current step is in the Kitchen, so the next action is "go east" to Bedchamber. Then proceed from there. So the next command should be "go east".
