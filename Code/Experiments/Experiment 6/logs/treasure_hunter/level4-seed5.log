You are now playing a profound game of TextWorld! First stop, attempt to take a trip east. After that, pick-up the fondue from the floor of the cookhouse. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Chamber =-
You're now in the chamber. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.

-= Cookhouse =-
You have fallen into the most typical of all possible cookhouses.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

There is a fondue on the floor.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game. They started in the Chamber, went east to the Cookhouse. Now, in the Cookhouse, they need to pick up the fondue from the floor. The prompt says that after taking the fondue, they win.

So the current location is the Cookhouse. The user has already gone east from the Chamber. The next step is to pick up the fondue. The instruction says to take the fondue from the floor of the cookhouse. The user's last action was going east, which brought them to the Cookhouse. Now, they need to pick up the fondue. The command should be to take the fondue. But wait, in text adventures, sometimes you have to use specific verbs. Like 'take fondue' or 'get fondue'. But the user's previous action was 'go east', so maybe the correct command here is 'take fondue' or 'get fondue'. Let me check the previous messages. The user was told to "pick-up the fondue from the floor of the cookhouse." So the correct action is to pick it up. The game might expect the command 'take fondue' or 'get fondue'. But the user's previous command was 'go east', so the next step is to take the fondue. The answer should be 'take fondue' or 'get fondue'. Let me make sure. The user is in the Cookhouse, and the fondue is on the floor. So the correct command is 'take fondue'. But maybe the game uses 'get' instead. However, the user's initial instruction says "pick-up the fondue", so maybe 'take' is the right verb. So the next action is 'take fondue'.
