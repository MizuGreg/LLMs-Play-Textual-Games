Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an profound round of TextWorld? You do! Here is how to play! Your first objective is to try to travel east. Following that, venture north. And then, pick-up the passkey from the floor of the attic. Alright, thanks!

-= Garage =-
You've just sauntered into a garage.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stand. The stand is usual. But there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You see a counter. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it.

There is an open portal leading east. There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

go east

-= Bathroom =-
You make another one of your grand eccentric entrances into a bathroom. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

Look over there! a dresser. The dresser is empty! What a waste of a day! You see a table. The table is usual. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is an open portal leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north.

-= Attic =-
Ah, the attic. This is some kind of attic, really great typical vibes in this place, a wonderful typical atmosphere. And now, well, you're in it. You begin to take stock of what's here.

An open cabinet, which looks typical, is here. What a letdown! The cabinet is empty! Oh, great. Here's a rack. However, the rack, like an empty rack, has nothing on it. You can make out a workbench. The workbench is ordinary. The workbench appears to be empty.

There is an unguarded exit to the south.

There is a passkey on the floor.
