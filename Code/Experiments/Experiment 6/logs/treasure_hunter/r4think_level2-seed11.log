Your objective is to retrieve the laptop from the floor of the studio.

-= Studio =-
You find yourself in a studio. An usual one.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

There is a laptop on the floor.

You arrive in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to retrieve the laptop from the studio. So far, they've gone north from the studio into the kitchen, then north again into the cookhouse. In the cookhouse, they found a glass on the floor. The current location is the cookhouse.

The original goal is to get the laptop from the studio floor. The user has moved away from the studio, so they need to figure out how to get back. The cookhouse has a door to the south that's unblocked. Maybe they should go south back to the kitchen, then find another way back to the studio. But in the kitchen, the exit to the east is unguarded, and north is unblocked. Wait, the user is in the cookhouse, so going south would take them back to the kitchen. Then from the kitchen, maybe go east? But the studio was initially to the north. Wait, the first move was north from studio to kitchen, then north again to cookhouse. So to get back to studio, they need to go south from cookhouse to kitchen, then south again to studio? But in the kitchen, the south exit is unblocked. Wait, the kitchen's description says there's an unblocked exit to the south. So from the kitchen, going south would take them back to the studio. But in the cookhouse, the south exit is unblocked. So the plan is: from cookhouse, go south to kitchen, then south again to studio, where the laptop is. But the user is currently in the cookhouse. So the next step should be to go south to the kitchen. But the user's last action was going north to cookhouse. So the next action should be to go south from cookhouse back to kitchen. Then from kitchen, go south to studio. But the user hasn't checked the studio again yet. Alternatively, maybe there's a different path. But the laptop is in the studio floor, so the user needs to get back there. The current location is cookhouse. So the next step is to go south to kitchen, then south again to studio. But the user's next command should be "go south" from cookhouse.
