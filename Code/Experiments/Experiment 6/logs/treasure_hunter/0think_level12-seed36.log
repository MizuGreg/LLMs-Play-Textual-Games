Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First step, attempt to take a trip south. If you can succeed at that, go east. And then, retrieve the sandwich from the floor of the workshop. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Sauna =-
You are in a sauna. A typical one.



There is an unblocked exit to the east. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go south
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Spare Room =-
You find yourself in a spare room. A normal kind of place. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."

Oh, great. Here's a rack. The rack is standard. However, the rack, like an empty rack, has nothing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the rack.

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked.

go east

-= Workshop =-
You've seen better workshops, but at least this one seems pretty normal.

You see a bureau. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things.

You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

There is a sandwich on the floor.
