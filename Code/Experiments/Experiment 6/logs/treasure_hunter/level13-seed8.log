Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First thing I need you to do is to venture south. And then, open the passageway within the cubicle. After that, move east. With that over with, pick up the nest of earwigs from the floor of the attic. That's it!

-= Recreation Zone =-
You find yourself in a recreation zone. A standard kind of place. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You make out a suitcase. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a locked locker close by. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a shelf. But the thing is empty.

There is an open portal leading south. There is an open gateway leading west. There is an unguarded exit to the east.

-= Cubicle =-
You are in a cubicle. A standard one. The room is well lit.

You can see a safe. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You can make out a table. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is a closed passageway leading east. There is an open portal leading north. There is an open hatch leading west. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Cubicle area. The original goal was to venture south, open the passageway in the cubicle, move east, and pick up the earwigs from the attic. So far, they've gone south from the Recreation Zone into the Cubicle. The next step according to the initial instructions was to open the passageway within the cubicle. 

Looking at the current description of the Cubicle, there's a closed passageway leading east. The user's next action should be to open that passageway. The prompt mentions that after venturing south, the next step is to open the passageway. So the correct command here is "open passageway east" or something similar. But the exact wording might matter. The user needs to interact with the passageway, so maybe "open passageway" if that's the correct command. Wait, the original instruction says "open the passageway within the cubicle," so perhaps the correct action is to open the passageway that's closed here.

The user is in the Cubicle, and the closed passageway is east. So the next step is to open that. The command should be "open passageway east" or "open east passageway." But in the game's context, maybe just "open passageway" if that's the correct syntax. However, looking at the previous actions, the user was told to "go south" and then "open the passageway within the cubicle." So the correct action here is to open the passageway. The game might require the exact command, so maybe "open passageway east" is needed. Alternatively, since the passageway is closed, the correct command is "open passageway."

But the user's previous action was "go south," and now they are in the Cubicle. The next step is to open the passageway. The description says there's a closed passageway leading east. So the correct command is "open passageway east." But maybe the game expects "open passageway" without specifying direction, but the description mentions the passageway is east. So I think the correct command is "open passageway east."

Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they need to follow specific steps. The original goal was to venture south, open the passageway in the cubicle, move east, and pick up the earwigs from the attic.

First, they started by going south, which led them to the Cubicle. Then they tried to open the passageway east. The game's response indicated that the passageway is closed, so the user needs to open it. The next step would be to open that passageway. But the user might be confused because they thought they had to open it, but the system's response didn't confirm it. However, the user's previous action was "open passageway east," which might have been the correct command. The game's feedback didn't mention an error, so maybe that action was successful. Now, after opening the passageway, the next step is to move east. The user needs to check if moving east is possible after opening the passageway. The original plan was to move east after opening the passageway. So the next action should be "go east." But the user's last action was "open passageway east," and the game's response didn't indicate success, but the user is now being asked if they're on the right track. The user might need to confirm that opening the passageway was correct, then proceed to move east. The next step is to go east, so the command should be "go east."

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through this text-based game. The original goal was to venture south, open the passageway in the cubicle, move east, and then pick up the earwigs in the attic. 

First, they started by going south from the Recreation Zone, which led them to the Cubicle. In the Cubicle, they tried to open the passageway east, but the game indicated that they need to open it first. So the user tried going east again, but the system corrected them.

Now, the user is at the Cubicle again, and the next step is to open the passageway east. The game's message says they have to open the passageway first. So the correct action here is to open the east passageway. The user's previous attempt was to go east without opening it, which wasn't allowed. So the next command should be to open the passageway east again. That makes sense because the game is enforcing the correct sequence of actions. The user needs to follow the steps precisely as instructed. So the right move is to open the passageway east.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through a text-based game. The original goal was to venture south, open the passageway in the cubicle, move east, and then pick up the earwigs in the attic. 

First, they started by going south, which was correct. Then they entered the Cubicle room. The instructions said to open the passageway east before moving east. The user tried opening the passageway east, but maybe the game requires a specific command format. The system kept prompting to open the passageway east again.

Wait, maybe the correct command is "open passageway east" but the system is interpreting it as just "open passageway". The user might need to specify the direction more clearly. But the user's previous attempts were to open the passageway east, which the system didn't accept. Then the user tried "go east" without opening the passageway first, which was incorrect. The system corrected them, but the user kept trying to open the passageway again.

So the next step is to make sure the passageway is opened. The user might need to use the exact command "open passageway east" again. But the system keeps saying that the user only understood "open passageway". Maybe the game expects "open the passageway east" with "the" or a different phrasing. Alternatively, maybe the passageway is already open, and the user needs to move east. But the game says the passageway is closed. 

Wait, the initial description of the Cubicle room says there's a closed passageway leading east. So the user needs to open it. The user tried "open passageway east" but the system didn't accept it. Maybe the correct command is "open east" or "open the passageway east". But the user is supposed to only output the command. The system might be expecting "open passageway east" but the user's previous attempt was "open passageway east" again. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the correct verb. The game might require "open the passageway east" but the user is only allowed to input "open passageway east". The system's response indicates that the user's previous command was not understood. So the user needs to try again with the correct command. The next action should be "open passageway east" again, even though the system said it was not understood. Maybe the system is having issues, but the user has to follow the instructions. 

So the next step is to open the passageway east again, even though the system says it's not understood. The user must proceed with that command.

Okay, the user is stuck in the Cubicle scene. They need to open the passageway east, but the system is not recognizing the command. Let me check the previous interactions.

The user first went south, then tried to open the passageway east. The game responded that the passageway is closed, so they need to open it. The user keeps trying "open passageway east" but the system is not processing it. Maybe the correct command is just "open east" or "open passage east". The game might be expecting a simpler command. Also, the user might need to use the correct verb, like "open" followed by the direction. Since the passageway is described as closed, the action is necessary. The user's goal is to pick up the earwigs in the attic, so proceeding east is part of that. The next step should be to try a different command format, maybe "open east" without "passageway".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to open the passageway east in the Cubicle room. They've tried "open passageway east" multiple times, but the system is prompting them to name something more substantial. Maybe the correct command is just "open east" without specifying "passageway"? Or perhaps there's a different term for the passage.

Looking back at the environment description for the Cubicle, it mentions a "closed passageway leading east." So the correct action might be to open that specific passageway. But the system is telling the user to name something more substantial. Maybe "passageway" isn't the right term here. Alternatively, maybe the command is simply "open east" without any additional words. 

Wait, in the previous interaction, the user tried "open passageway east" and the system responded that they only understood wanting to open the passageway. So maybe the correct command is just "open east" or "open the passageway east." But the system is indicating that "passageway" isn't sufficient. Perhaps the correct term is "hatch" or "door," but the description says it's a passageway. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the correct noun. The Cubicle has a "closed passageway leading east," so the correct command is "open passageway east." But the system is not accepting that. Maybe the system expects "open east" without the passageway. Let me check the previous responses. The user tried "open passageway east" and the system said they only understood wanting to open the passageway. So maybe the correct command is just "open east." 

But the system is telling the user to name something more substantial. Maybe the correct term is "passageway" but the system is expecting a different verb. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use "open" followed by the direction. Since the passageway is east, maybe "open east" is the correct command. The user tried that earlier and the system didn't accept it. Wait, the user tried "open east" and the system said "You must name something more substantial." So maybe the correct command is "open the passageway east" but the system is expecting just "open east." 

Alternatively, perhaps the system is expecting the user to use the correct noun. The passageway is closed, so the correct action is to open it. The user has tried "open passageway east" multiple times, but the system is not accepting it. Maybe the correct command is "open east" without the passageway. The system is prompting the user to name something more substantial, so maybe "passageway" is not the right term. 

Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "open the east passage" or similar. But the system is expecting a specific command. Given that the user is in the Cubicle and the passageway is east, the correct action is to open the passageway east. But the system is not accepting that. Maybe the user needs to use "open" followed by the direction, so "open east." But the system is saying that's not enough. 

Hmm, this is confusing. The user's goal is to open the passageway east, but the system is not accepting the command. Maybe the correct command is "open east" without any additional words. The user tried that and the system said "You must name something more substantial." So maybe the correct command is "open the passageway east." But the system is not accepting that. 

Alternatively, maybe the system is expecting the user to use the correct verb. The passageway is closed, so the correct action is to open it. The user has tried "open passageway east" and the system is not accepting it. Maybe the correct command is "open east." But the system is not accepting that. 

I think the correct command is "open east," but the system is expecting a different term. Maybe the system is expecting "open the passageway east." But the user has tried that and it's not working. Alternatively, maybe the system is expecting "open the passage east." 

But the user is supposed to only output the command. The previous attempts were "open passageway east" and "open east." The system is not accepting either. Maybe the correct command is "open the east passage." But I'm not sure. 

Given the system's response, "You must name something more substantial," maybe the user needs to use a more specific term. The passageway is closed, so the correct action is to open it. The correct command is "open passageway east." But the system is not accepting that. 

Alternatively, maybe the system is expecting the user to use the correct noun. The passageway is a closed passage, so the correct command is "open east." But the system is not accepting that. 

I think the correct command is "open east," but the system is not accepting it. Therefore, the user needs to try "open east" again, even though the system is prompting for something more substantial. Maybe the system is just being strict, and the correct command is indeed "open east."

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to open a passageway in the Cubicle room. The game keeps saying "You must name something more substantial." So, the problem is that the previous commands like "open passageway east" or "open east" aren't being recognized.

Looking back at the environment description for the Cubicle, there's a closed passageway leading east. The user needs to open that. But the game is expecting a more specific command. Maybe the correct command is "open east" but the game is prompting for a more substantial name. Wait, maybe the passageway has a specific name or the user needs to use a different verb.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct command is "open the passageway east" but the game is not accepting that. Or maybe the user needs to use a different phrasing. However, the user has tried "open passageway east" multiple times, and the game is not recognizing it. The error message suggests that the command is too vague. Maybe the correct command is simply "open east" but the game is expecting a more precise term.

Alternatively, maybe the passageway is called something else. Let me check the environment again.

The game might be expecting the command "open east" but the user is getting an error. However, the user tried "open east" and the game says "You must name something more substantial." So maybe the correct command is "open the east passageway" but the game is not accepting that. Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "open passage east" or "open passage".

Wait, the initial instruction from the user was to "open the passageway within the cubicle." So maybe the correct command is "open passageway" but the game is expecting a direction. Since the passageway is east, perhaps the command is "open east". But the game is not accepting it. Maybe the correct command is "open the east passageway" but the game is not recognizing that. Alternatively, maybe the game is expecting the user to use the verb "open" with the object being the passageway, but the user is not specifying the direction.

Alternatively, maybe the passageway is named something else. But according to the environment, it's just a closed passageway leading east. So the user needs to open it. The game is not accepting "open east" because it's too vague. Maybe the correct command is "open the passageway east" but the game is not accepting that. Alternatively, maybe the game is expecting the user to use the verb "open" with the direction, like "open east".

But the game keeps saying "You must name something more substantial." So perhaps the correct command is "open the east passageway".

Okay, the user is stuck in the game. They tried to open the passageway east multiple times, but the system keeps saying "You must name something more substantial." So, the problem is that the command "open east" isn't valid. The correct action should be to open the passageway east, but the system might be expecting a different phrasing.

Looking back at the previous interactions, the user was told that there's a closed passageway leading east. The correct command should be "open passageway east" or "open east passageway." But the user kept typing "open east," which might not be the right syntax. The system is probably expecting the full name of the object to open, which is "passageway east." 

So, the next step is to use the correct command: "open passageway east." That should resolve the issue. The user needs to make sure they're using the exact phrasing the game expects. Since the system is not accepting "open east," the correct command is "open passageway east."

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to open the passageway east in the Cubicle room. They've been getting messages that they need to name something more substantial. The previous attempts were just "open east" or "open passageway east", but the system is not recognizing those as correct.

Wait, maybe the correct command is to use the noun "passageway" instead of "east"? Or perhaps the system expects a different phrasing. The user's last attempt was "open passageway east", but the system said "I only understood you as far as wanting to open passageway." So maybe the system is expecting the player to specify the object to open, not just the direction.

In the Cubicle description, there's a "closed passageway leading east". So the passageway is the object that's closed and needs to be opened. The user is trying to open it, but the system is not accepting "open passageway east" because it's not specific enough. Maybe the correct command is just "open passageway" without mentioning east, but that might not be right since the passageway is specifically east.

Alternatively, maybe the system is expecting the player to use the direction as part of the command. But the user tried "open passageway east" and it didn't work. The system's response suggests that the user is only indicating the action (open passageway) but not the specific object. Wait, but the passageway is the object. Maybe the correct command is "open passageway" and the system will infer that it's the east one. But in the game's context, the passageway is already described as leading east, so perhaps the correct command is just "open passageway".

But the user's previous attempts to say "open east" were rejected because the system said to name something more substantial. So maybe "open passageway" is the correct command here. Let me check the game's previous messages. In the Cubicle room, the player is told there's a closed passageway leading east. So the passageway is the object that needs to be opened. Therefore, the correct command should be "open passageway".

But the user tried "open passageway east" and the system didn't accept it. Maybe the system is expecting the player to use the noun "passageway" without the direction. So the correct command is "open passageway". Let me try that.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through this text-based game. The goal is to venture south, open the passageway in the cubicle, move east, and then pick up the nest of earwigs from the attic.

First, the user started by going south from the Recreation Zone. That was correct. Then they entered the Cubicle, where they needed to open the passageway east. The game kept prompting them to open the passageway, and they kept typing "open passageway east" or similar variations. The system was getting confused because the correct command is "open passageway east" but the user was sometimes omitting "east" or using different phrasing.

Eventually, the user tried "open passageway" and it worked. Now, after successfully opening the passageway, the next step is to move east. The user is now in the Cubicle, having opened the east passageway. The next logical step is to go east into that passage. The user needs to input "go east" to proceed. Since the previous attempts were about opening the passageway, the next action should be moving east. The user might have been stuck on the same command, but now that the passageway is open, moving east is the next correct action.

-= Attic =-
You've stumbled into an usual room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be usual. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the attic.

You make out a workbench. The workbench is typical. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is an open passageway leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

There is a nest of earwigs on the floor.

Okay, let's see. The user's goal was to pick up the nest of earwigs from the attic. So far, they've navigated through the Recreation Zone, Cubicle, and now the Attic. The current room is the Attic, and there's a nest of earwigs on the floor. The user needs to pick that up.

Looking at the available actions, the user is in the Attic. The commands possible would be to interact with the nest. Since the prompt says to only output the action, like "pick up nest of earwigs", that's the correct command here. The user has already moved east after opening the passageway, so the next step is to pick up the earwigs. The game's feedback indicates that the nest is present, so the action should be to pick it up. No other commands are needed here. Just the pickup action.
