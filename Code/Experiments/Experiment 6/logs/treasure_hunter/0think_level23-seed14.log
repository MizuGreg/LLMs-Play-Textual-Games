Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an fast paced round of TextWorld? You do! First step, head east. Okay, and then, go north. Once you accomplish that, take a trip east. Once you finish that, try to go south. Once you accomplish that, head south. After that, make an effort to travel south. With that done, recover the mop from the floor of the laundry place. Got that? Good!

-= Laundromat =-
Ah, the laundromat. This is some kind of laundromat, really great normal vibes in this place, a wonderful normal atmosphere. And now, well, you're in it.

You make out a table. The table is ordinary. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is an open portal leading east. There is an open gate leading south. There is an open passageway leading west.
