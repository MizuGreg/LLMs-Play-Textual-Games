Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, make absolutely sure that the portal is open. After that, go south. And then, pick up the mug from the floor of the cookery. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Workshop =-
You're now in a workshop.

You can see an opened portmanteau in the corner. The portmanteau is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever!

There is a closed portal leading south. There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

-= Cookery =-
You find yourself in a cookery. An ordinary kind of place. Let's see what's in here.

You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to a cabinet. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The cabinet is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever!

There is an open portal leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a mug on the floor.

-= Bedroom =-
You are in a bedroom. A standard kind of place.

Oh, great. Here's a locker. You see a mantelpiece. The mantelpiece is normal. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You see a recliner. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You see a bar. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked.
