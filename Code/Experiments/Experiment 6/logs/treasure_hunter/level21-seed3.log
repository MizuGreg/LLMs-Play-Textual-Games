It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, venture south. With that done, attempt to take a trip south. Then, recover the shadfly from the floor of the laundromat. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Bedchamber =-
You're not going to believe this, but you've just entered a bedchamber.

You can see a closed portmanteau.

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

-= Lounge =-
You arrive in a lounge. A standard kind of place. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a shelf. The shelf is normal. The shelf appears to be empty.

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the south. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is in a text-based adventure game, and their goal is to recover the shadfly from the laundromat and then win. So far, they've been moving between different rooms: bedchamber, lounge, restroom, kitchen, and back and forth between some of these.

Looking at the current location, they're in the Kitchen again. The description mentions a pan, but it's empty. The exits are east, north, south, and west. The user has been moving around, but they haven't found the shadfly yet. The original instruction said to first venture south, then take a trip south again, then recover the shadfly from the laundromat.

Wait, the laundromat isn't mentioned in the current rooms. The user has been in the kitchen, lounge, restroom, etc. Maybe the laundromat is another room they haven't explored yet. Let me check the previous steps.

Starting from the bedchamber, they went south to the lounge, then west to the restroom, north to the kitchen, south back to the restroom, east to the lounge, west back to the restroom, and then north to the kitchen again. So they haven't reached the laundromat yet. The laundromat must be a different room. Maybe the laundromat is connected to one of these rooms, but it's not listed yet. Alternatively, maybe the laundromat is the restroom? But the user's goal is to recover the shadfly from the laundromat's floor. The current rooms don't mention a laundromat.

Wait, the initial instruction said: "recover the shadfly from the floor of the laundromat." So the laundromat is a specific room. The user hasn't entered it yet. So maybe the laundromat is connected to one of the exits. Let's look at the exits again.

In the kitchen, there's an unguarded exit to the north, south, east, and west. The user is currently in the kitchen. If they go north, they're back in the restroom. If they go east, they're in the lounge. South takes them back to the restroom again. West is the kitchen's exit, which is unblocked. Wait, maybe the laundromat is connected to the kitchen via one of these exits? Or perhaps the laundromat is the restroom? But the restroom is described as ordinary, and the user hasn't found the shadfly there.

Alternatively, maybe the laundromat is the kitchen? But the kitchen has a pan, but no mention of a laundromat. Hmm. The user's task is to recover the shadfly from the laundromat's floor. So the laundromat must be a room they haven't explored yet. Let me check the previous steps again.

The user has been moving between the bedchamber, lounge, restroom, kitchen. The laundromat isn't in the list. Maybe the laundromat is the restroom? But the restroom's description says there's an opened cabinet, which is empty. The user hasn't found the shadfly there. Alternatively, maybe the laundromat is the kitchen? But the kitchen's description doesn't mention a laundromat.

Wait, maybe the laundromat is the same as the restroom? Or perhaps the laundromat is a different room that's not yet explored. The user needs to find the shadfly on the floor of the laundromat. Since the user hasn't entered the laundromat yet, they need to find a way to get there.

Looking at the current location in the kitchen, the exits are north (restroom), south (restroom), east (lounge), west (unblocked exit). Wait, the kitchen's exit to the west is unblocked. So maybe the laundromat is connected to the west exit of the kitchen? But the user hasn't checked that yet. Alternatively, maybe the laundromat is the lounge? But the lounge is described as having a shelf, which is empty.

Alternatively, maybe the laundromat is the bedchamber? But the bedchamber has a closed portmanteau. The user hasn't checked that yet.

Wait, the initial instruction said to first venture south, then take a trip south again. The user started in the bedchamber, went south to the lounge, then west to the restroom, then north to the kitchen, then south back to the restroom, east to the lounge, west back to the restroom, and then north to the kitchen again. So the user is stuck in a loop between the kitchen, restroom, and lounge. They haven't found the laundromat yet.

Maybe the laundromat is connected to the kitchen's west exit. Let me check the kitchen's description again. The kitchen has an exit to the west that's unblocked. So if the user goes west from the kitchen, they might reach the laundromat. But the user hasn't tried that yet. Let me check the previous steps. The user was in the kitchen, and the last action was going north to the kitchen again. So maybe the next step is to go west from the kitchen to reach the laundromat.

Alternatively, maybe the laundromat is the restroom. But the user hasn't found the shadfly there. The restroom has an opened cabinet, which is empty. The user needs to find the shadfly on the floor of the laundromat. So maybe the laundromat is the restroom, and the shadfly is on the floor there. But the user hasn't checked the floor yet. However, in the restroom description, the user only sees the cabinet, which is empty. The floor isn't mentioned. So maybe the user needs to check the floor of the restroom for the shadfly.

But the user's current location is the kitchen. The exits from the kitchen are north (restroom), south (restroom), east (lounge), west (unblocked). So the user needs to go west from the kitchen to reach the laundromat. But the user hasn't tried that yet. So the next step would be to go west from the kitchen to reach the laundromat. Then, once there, check the floor for the shadfly.

Alternatively, maybe the laundromat is the lounge? But the lounge has a shelf, which is empty. The user hasn't found the shadfly there either.

So the user needs to go west from the kitchen to reach the laundromat. Let me check the previous steps again. The user is in the kitchen, and the last action was going north to the kitchen again. So the next step should be to go west from the kitchen. That would be the next move. Then, once in the laundromat (assuming that's the west exit), check the floor for the shadfly.

Therefore, the next action should be "go west" from the kitchen to reach the laundromat.

-= Steam Room =-
You make a grand eccentric entrance into a steam room. You begin looking for stuff.

You make out a counter. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. Sometimes, just sometimes, TextWorld can just be the worst. You make out a shiny rack. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can see a shiny shelf. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

You are in an office.

What's that over there? It looks like it's a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The table is ordinary. The table appears to be empty. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a stand. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing hasn't got anything on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.
