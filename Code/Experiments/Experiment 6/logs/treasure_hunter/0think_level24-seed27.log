You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a pan. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

-= Canteen =-
You've entered a canteen.

If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. You make out a board. The board is typical. However, the board, like an empty board, has nothing on it.

There is an unguarded exit to the east. There is an unguarded exit to the north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

Well I'll be, you are in the place we're calling the kitchenette.

You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a pan. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!
