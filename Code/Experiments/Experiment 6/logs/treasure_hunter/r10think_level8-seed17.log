Welcome to another profound round of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to attempt to take a trip west. With that over with, make an effort to venture west. And then, attempt to go to the north. After that, lift the fondue from the floor of the office. Got that? Good!

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is in a text-based game where they have to navigate through different rooms and maybe collect items. The goal mentioned earlier was to lift the fondue from the office. Let me recap the journey so far.

Starting in the Salon, they went west to the Bar. Then tried to go north but couldn't. So they went west again to the Pantry. From there, they tried east, north, and south, but the only possible exits were east and west. Then they went back to the Bar again. Now, they're stuck again trying to go north from the Bar, which is blocked.

The user is asking if they're making the right moves and if they're close to the goal. The key items mentioned were a key on the floor in the Salon and the fondue in the office. So far, they haven't picked up the key, which might be necessary to open a door or something. The fondue is in the office, which hasn't been accessed yet.

Looking at the current location, the Bar has exits to east and west. The Pantry has exits to east, north, south (but maybe those are blocked?). Wait, in the Pantry description, it says "You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south." So maybe those exits are blocked, but the user is trying to go east again, which leads back to the Bar.

The user is stuck in a loop between the Bar and Pantry. They need to find a way to get to the office where the fondue is. Maybe the key in the Salon is needed to open a door. But the user hasn't picked it up yet. Wait, in the Salon, there's a key on the floor. So perhaps they need to pick up the key first. But in the initial move, they went west from Salon to Bar, so they didn't pick up the key.

So the next step should be to go back to the Salon, pick up the key, then use it to open a door somewhere. But the current location is the Bar. So the user needs to go back east to the Salon. Wait, in the Bar, there's an exit to the east, which would take them back to the Salon. Then they can pick up the key.

But in the previous steps, when they were in the Bar, they tried going north and couldn't. So the key is in the Salon, which is east of the Bar. So the correct path would be: from Bar, go east to Salon, pick up the key, then find a way to the office. Maybe the office is north of the Salon, but the initial move was west, so perhaps the office is accessible after getting the key.

So the next action should be to go east from the Bar back to the Salon, pick up the key, then proceed north to the office. But the user hasn't done that yet. The current step is in the Bar, trying to go north again, which is blocked. So the correct next move is to go east to the Salon.
