Welcome to another exciting session of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First step, go north. And then, attempt to go north. Then, go east. After that, venture north. With that done, pick-up the loaf of bread from the floor of the dish-pit. That's it!

-= Kitchen =-
Well, here we are in the kitchen. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a rack. The rack is typical. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You can make out a platter. The platter is normal. But the thing is empty. Hm. Oh well

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

-= Cookery =-
You've entered a cookery.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Cookhouse =-
You are in a cookhouse. An usual kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

You can see a pan. The pan is normal. But there isn't a thing on it.

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.



>                                                                                                                                -= Cookhouse =-0/3

-= Canteen =-
You have walked into a canteen. Not the canteen you'd expect. No, this is a canteen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You see an opened freezer in the corner. What a letdown! The freezer is empty!

There is an open gate leading east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.



>                                                                                                                                -= Canteen =-0/4

-= Dish-Pit =-
You arrive in a dish-pit. An ordinary one.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

There is a loaf of bread on the floor.


>                                                                                                                                -= Dish-Pit =-0/5
Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in the Dish-Pit, and there's a loaf of bread on the floor. The original task was to pick up the loaf of bread from the dish-pit. So far, the user has navigated through several rooms: Kitchen, Cookery, Cookhouse, Canteen, and now Dish-Pit. The next step is to pick up the bread.

The current room is Dish-Pit. The user needs to pick up the bread. The command should be "take loaf of bread" or something similar. But in TextWorld, the exact command might be "get loaf of bread" or "pick up loaf of bread". Looking at previous interactions, the user was told to "pick-up the loaf of bread from the floor of the dish-pit." So the correct command here is likely "take loaf of bread" or "get loaf of bread".

Since the user is in the Dish-Pit and the bread is on the floor, the correct action is to take the bread. The next action should be "take loaf of bread".
