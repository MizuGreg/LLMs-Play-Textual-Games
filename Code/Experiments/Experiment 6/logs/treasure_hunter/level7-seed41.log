Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First, it would be fantastic if you could make an attempt to travel east. Then, attempt to go east. With that accomplished, take a trip north. Next, pick-up the keycard from the floor of the restroom. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Kitchenette =-
You're now in the kitchenette.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east.
