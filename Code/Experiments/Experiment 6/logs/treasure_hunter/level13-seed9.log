Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First off, try to take a trip west. And then, make an attempt to venture west. And then, make an attempt to head north. If you can do that, lift the poem from the floor of the bedchamber. And if you do that, you're the winner!

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in a text-based game. The goal is to lift the poem from the bedchamber. So far, they've gone west from the canteen into a sauna. Now, in the sauna, the options are north, east, or west.

The user's previous action was "go west", which led them to the sauna. Now, they need to follow the instructions given by the game. The original instructions said to first go west, then venture west again, then head north. But in the current scenario, they're in the sauna. Let me check the game's current state.

In the sauna, there's an open passageway north, an unguarded east entrance, and an exit west. The user's next steps should align with the initial plan: after going west (canteen to sauna), the next step was to venture west again. But wait, the sauna's west exit is unblocked. So maybe the user should go west from the sauna. But the original plan said after the first west, then venture west again, then north. But maybe the sequence is to go west, then west again, then north. However, in the current room (sauna), going west would take them back to the canteen? Or maybe the sauna's west exit leads to another area. Wait, the initial movement was from canteen west to sauna. Now, from sauna, west is an exit. So going west from sauna would take them back to the canteen? But the canteen was already visited. Alternatively, maybe the sauna's west exit leads to a different room. But according to the game's description, the sauna has an unblocked exit to the west. So the user is in the sauna, and the next step should be to go west again, as per the initial plan. But the user's next action should be to go west. However, the user's previous action was "go west" which led to the sauna. Now, the next step in the plan is to venture west again. But in the sauna, the west exit is available. So the user should go west again. But maybe the game's layout is such that going west from the sauna leads to another room. However, the user's goal is to reach the bedchamber. Alternatively, maybe after the sauna, the next step is to go north. But the original instructions said after going west (canteen to sauna), then venture west again (maybe from sauna to another room?), then head north. But the user is in the sauna now. The game's current description says there's an open passageway north. So perhaps the next step is to go north. But the original plan was to go west, then west again, then north. But in the sauna, the user can go north. However, the user's previous action was to go west (from canteen to sauna). Then, the next step in the plan is to venture west again. But in the sauna, the west exit is available. So maybe the user should go west again. But the user is in the sauna, and the west exit is unblocked. So the correct next action would be to go west. However, the user's next action should be to go north as per the original instructions. Wait, the original instructions said: first go west, then venture west, then head north. So after the first west (canteen to sauna), then venture west again (maybe from sauna to another room?), then north. But in the sauna, the user can go west, east, or north. The user's next action should be to go west again. But the user is in the sauna, and the west exit is unblocked. So the next action is "go west". However, the user's next action is to go north. But according to the original plan, after the first west, then venture west again, then north. So maybe the user should go west again. But the user is in the sauna. The game's description says that in the sauna, there's an unguarded exit to the west. So the user should go west again. But the user is in the sauna, and going west would take them to another room. But the user's goal is to reach the bedchamber. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go north from the sauna. But the original plan says after going west, then venture west again, then north. So the user's next action should be to go west again. However, the user is in the sauna, and the west exit is available. So the correct next action is "go west". But the user's next action is to go north. Wait, the original instructions said: first go west, then venture west, then head north. So after the first west (canteen to sauna), then venture west again (sauna to another room?), then head north. But the user is in the sauna. The game's current description says that in the sauna, there's an open passageway north. So maybe the user should go north. But according to the plan, after venturing west again, then head north. So the user's next action is to go west again. But the user is in the sauna. The west exit is available. So the user should go west. But the user's next action is to go north. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me recheck the original instructions. The user was told: "First off, try to take a trip west. And then, make an attempt to venture west. And then, make an attempt to head north. If you can do that, lift the poem from the floor of the bedchamber." So the sequence is: go west (from canteen to sauna), then venture west (from sauna to another room?), then head north. So in the sauna, the user needs to go west again. But the sauna's west exit is unblocked. So the next action is "go west". But the user is in the sauna. So the correct next action is "go west". However, the user's next action is to go north. But according to the plan, after the first west (canteen to sauna), then venture west again (sauna to another room?), then north. So the user should go west again. Therefore, the next action is "go west".

-= Spare Room =-
You are in a spare room. A typical one.

You can make out an opened ordinary looking cabinet in the corner. The cabinet is empty, what a horrible day!

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.



>                                                                                                                                -= Spare Room =-0/3

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and eventually lift the poem from the bedchamber. The current room is the Spare Room, and the user has been moving west, then west again. The goal is to go west, then west again, then north, and lift the poem.

So far, the user has gone from the Canteen to the Sauna, then to the Spare Room. The next step according to the instructions is to try heading north. The Spare Room has an exit to the north that's unblocked. The user's next action should be to go north. Let me check the previous steps again to make sure.

The original instructions said: first, try to take a trip west. Then, make an attempt to venture west again. Then, head north. After that, lift the poem. So the sequence is west, west, north. The user has done west (Canteen to Sauna), then west again (Sauna to Spare Room). Now, the next step is north. The Spare Room has a north exit, so going north from there would be the next logical step. The user hasn't tried that yet. So the correct command here is "go north".
</think>go north

-= Bedchamber =-
You find yourself in a bedchamber. An usual kind of place.



There is an unblocked exit to the east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

There is a poem on the floor.


>                                                                                                                                -= Bedchamber =-0/4
Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text adventure game, and the goal is to lift the poem from the floor of the bedchamber. So far, the player has moved west from the canteen, then west again to the sauna, then west to the spare room, and then north to the bedchamber. Now, in the bedchamber, there's a poem on the floor.

The original instructions said to first go west, then try to venture west again, then head north. The user has already done those steps. Now, in the bedchamber, the next step would be to pick up the poem. But the game might require specific commands. The player is told to "lift the poem from the floor of the bedchamber" and then they'd be the winner.

So the current location is the bedchamber, and the poem is there. The next action should be to pick up the poem. The command would be "take poem" or "lift poem". But in text adventures, sometimes the exact phrasing matters. The user's previous actions were "go west" and "go north", so maybe the correct command here is "take poem" or "get poem". Let me check the previous messages. The user was told to "lift the poem from the floor of the bedchamber. And if you do that, you're the winner!" So the correct action is to lift the poem. The command would be "lift poem" or "take poem". Since the user has to only output the action, the correct command here is "take poem" or "lift poem". Looking at the previous interactions, the user used "go west" and "go north", so the next step is to pick up the poem. The correct command is "take poem".
</think>take poem
