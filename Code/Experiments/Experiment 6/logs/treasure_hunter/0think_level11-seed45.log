Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. Your first objective is to make an attempt to take a trip south. That done, lift the potato from the floor of the kitchenette. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Cookery =-
Look at you, bigshot, walking into a cookery like it isn't some huge deal. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

You scan the room for a chest, and you find a chest. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a pan. But there isn't a thing on it.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Kitchenette =-
If you're wondering why everything seems so usual all of a sudden, it's because you've just walked into the kitchenette.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

There is a potato and a sandwich on the floor.
