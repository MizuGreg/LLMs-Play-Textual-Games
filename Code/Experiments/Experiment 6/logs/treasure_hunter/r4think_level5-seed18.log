I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First thing I need you to do is to make an attempt to travel south. Following that, try to take a trip east. After that, pick up the latchkey from the floor of the studio. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Study =-
You've just walked into a study.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Workshop =-
You find yourself in a workshop.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the north.

-= Studio =-
Well I'll be, you are in a place we're calling a studio. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

There is a latchkey on the floor.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me figure out what to do next. The user is in the Studio, and the goal is to pick up the latchkey from the floor. The previous steps were going south then east, which led them to the Studio. Now, the instructions say to pick up the latchkey. But the current description mentions that there's a latchkey on the floor. So the next action should be to pick it up.

Wait, the user's last input was the system message asking if they're making the right actions. The user is supposed to respond with the next command. The current room is the Studio, and the latchkey is on the floor. So the correct action is to take the latchkey. The user needs to type "take latchkey" or something similar. But in the game's context, the command might be "take latchkey" or "get latchkey". Let me check the previous commands. The user had "go south" and "go east" before. So the next step is to pick up the latchkey. The correct command would be "take latchkey". But I need to make sure that's the right syntax. The system message says to only output the action, so "take latchkey" is the command.
