Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First thing I need you to do is to attempt to go west. That done, attempt to go south. Once you accomplish that, head west. And then, make an effort to take a trip west. After that, travel north. With that accomplished, head east. Once you succeed at that, try to go north. After that, venture east. And then, head north. After that, attempt to take a trip east. Next, recover the keycard from the floor of the bathroom. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Spare Room =-
You arrive in a spare room. A standard one. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You scan the room for a coffer, and you find a coffer. You check the price tag that's still affixed to the coffer. Thirty big ones?! That's ridiculous! You know my pal, they work for the post office? I'm sure my friend could get you one of those for 45 bucks! You can see a suitcase. What a letdown! The suitcase is empty!

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

-= Scullery =-
You are in a scullery. An usual kind of place. You start to take note of what's in the room.

What's that over there? It looks like it's a pan. The pan is usual. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a platter. But there isn't a thing on it. You can see a board. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

You are in a scullery. An usual kind of place. You start to take note of what's in the room.

What's that over there? It looks like it's a pan. The pan is usual. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a platter. But there isn't a thing on it. You can see a board. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.
