Welcome to TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, you could, like, make an attempt to go to the north. After that, pick-up the folder from the floor of the cubicle. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Studio =-
You arrive in a studio. An usual one. You begin to take stock of what's here.



There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

There is a stick of butter on the floor.
