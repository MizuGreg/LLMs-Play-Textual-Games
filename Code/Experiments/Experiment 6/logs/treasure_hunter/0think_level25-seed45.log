Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to go south. Then, pick up the type Y key from the stand within the spare room. If you have got the type Y key, attempt to go to the north. Next, unlock the type Y door with the type Y key. Then, ensure that the type Y door inside the vault is open. Then, travel east. After that, open the gate. After that, go to the north. With that over with, go to the west. Then, venture north. After that, take the cashew from the shelf. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Vault =-
You've moved into a standard room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be standard. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the vault.

You see an opened suitcase. The suitcase is empty, what a horrible day!

There is a closed type Y door leading east. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

-= Spare Room =-
Well I'll be, you are in the place we're calling the spare room.

You scan the room, seeing a cabinet. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. What's that over there? It looks like it's a stand. You see a type Y key on the stand.

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north.

-= Vault =-
You've moved into a standard room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be standard. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the vault.

You see an opened suitcase. The suitcase is empty, what a horrible day!

There is a closed type Y door leading east. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.
