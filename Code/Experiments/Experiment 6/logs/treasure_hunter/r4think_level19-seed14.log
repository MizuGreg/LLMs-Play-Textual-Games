You are now playing a exciting game of TextWorld! First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to go east. And then, ensure that the gate is open. And then, try to travel north. After that, open the portal. After that, make an effort to venture north. After that, make an attempt to head west. Following that, go to the north. Okay, and then, take a trip east. Next, recover the butterfly from the box in the workshop. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Parlor =-
You arrive in a parlor. A normal one.

If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a trunk.

There is an open hatch leading east. There is an open door leading west.

There is a pillow on the floor.

Well, here we are in a canteen.

You find yourself in a standard kind of place. That is to say, you're in a cubicle. You can barely contain your excitement.

You make out a shelf. The shelf is ordinary. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.

There is a closed portal leading north. There is an open gate leading south.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game and has followed a series of steps. They started in the parlor, went east to the canteen, tried to go north but had to open the gate, which they did. Then they went north again to the cubicle. Now they're asking if they're on the right track and what their next move should be.

First, I need to recall the game's current state. The cubicle has a closed portal north and an open gate south. The user's goal is to recover the butterfly from the workshop. So far, they've opened gates and moved through different areas. The next logical step would be to check the portal in the cubicle. Since the portal is closed, they might need to open it. Alternatively, maybe there's something else in the cubicle they need to do, like checking the shelf, but the shelf is described as empty. 

The user's previous actions were moving east, opening gates, and going north. The next step would likely be to interact with the portal. The instruction says to only output the action, so the answer should be "open portal" or something similar. But the game might require specific commands. Looking at the previous interactions, when they tried to go north after opening the gate, they were moved to the cubicle. Now, the portal is closed, so the correct action would be to open it. Then, after opening, they can go north again. The user also needs to eventually reach the workshop to get the butterfly. So the next step is to open the portal in the cubicle.
</think>open portal

You open portal.

-= Cellar =-
You are in a cellar. A normal one.



There is an open portal leading south. There is an open passageway leading west.

GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Office =-
You find yourself in an usual kind of place. That is to say, you're in an office.

You can see a desk. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

There is an open passageway leading east. There is an open gateway leading north.



>                                                                                                                                -= Office =-0/8

-= Chamber =-
You find yourself in a chamber. An ordinary one.



There is an open gateway leading south. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Chamber, which has an open gateway south and an exit east. Their goal is to recover the butterfly from the workshop. So far, they've navigated through several areas, opening gates and portals. The next step would likely be to check the exit east or continue north. But the Chamber's exit east is unblocked, so maybe that's a path to the workshop. Alternatively, the gateway south leads back to the Office. Since the workshop hasn't been mentioned yet, maybe the exit east is the way to go. The user needs to proceed towards the workshop, so the next action should be to go east.

-= Workshop =-
You've just shown up in a workshop.

You can see a box. The box contains a butterfly. You make out a locker. You can see a portmanteau.

You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.



>                                                                                                                                -= Workshop =-0/10
