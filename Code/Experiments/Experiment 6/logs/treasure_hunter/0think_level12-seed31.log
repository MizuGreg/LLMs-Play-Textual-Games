Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! First of all, you could, like, take a trip south. Once you manage that, attempt to move east. With that accomplished, lift the gummy bear from the floor of the vault. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Cookhouse =-
You are in a cookhouse. A standard one. Let's see what's in here.

You can make out a rack. The rack appears to be empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the rack.

There is an unblocked exit to the south. There is an unguarded exit to the west.
