Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First stop, attempt to travel west. After that, make an effort to go south. Then, pick-up the passkey from the floor of the cookery. Got that? Good!

-= Canteen =-
You find yourself in a canteen. A standard one. You begin looking for stuff.



You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

-= Bedchamber =-
You arrive in a bedchamber. An ordinary kind of place.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.
