Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, head south. After that, take a trip west. And then, recover the knife from the board. That's it!

-= Canteen =-
Guess what, you are in a place we're calling a canteen. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

>                                                                                                                                -= Canteen =-0/1
AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go south
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Dish-Pit =-
You make another one of your grand eccentric entrances into a dish-pit. You begin looking for stuff.

You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a pan. The pan is usual. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the west.



>                                                                                                                                -= Dish-Pit =-0/2
AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go west

-= Cookhouse =-
You're now in a cookhouse.

You see a closed freezer nearby. You can see a board. On the board you can see a knife.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.
