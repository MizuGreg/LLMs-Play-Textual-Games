Welcome to TextWorld! Your first objective is to make an effort to take a trip west. And then, go to the south. After that, head west. With that accomplished, lift the fly larva from the floor of the cookhouse. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Cubicle =-
Well, here we are in a cubicle. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.



There is an open door leading south. There is an open gateway leading west.

GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Study =-
Of every study you could have walked into, you had to come round an usual one. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You see a locked coffer. You make out a trunk. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You scan the room for a stand, and you find a stand. The stand is typical. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is an open gateway leading east. There is an open gate leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

-= Launderette =-
You arrive in a launderette. A typical kind of place.

You can see a bench. The bench is ordinary. However, the bench, like an empty bench, has nothing on it.

There is an open gate leading east. There is an open portal leading south. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Salon =-
You find yourself in a salon. A normal kind of place. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

Look over there! a safe. The safe is empty! What a waste of a day! You can make out a bar. The bar is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked.



>                                                                                                                                -= Salon =-0/4

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in the Salon room. They've tried going west, but it's blocked. Then they tried south and east, but both are blocked. The original goal was to go west, then south, then west again, and then lift the fly larva from the cookhouse.

Wait, the user's path so far: started in Cubicle, went west to Study, then west to Launderette, then west to Salon. Now, in Salon, they can't go west. The exits here are east (unblocked) and maybe south? But the user tried south and couldn't. The room description says there's an exit to the east. So maybe the only way out is east. But the original plan was to go west, south, west. But in the Salon, going west is blocked. Maybe the user needs to find another path. Alternatively, maybe the cookhouse is somewhere else. Wait, the original goal was to lift the fly larva from the cookhouse. So maybe the user needs to find the cookhouse. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the user is stuck in a loop. Let me check the previous rooms. From Salon, the user came from the west (Launderette). The Salon has an exit to the east. So perhaps the user needs to go east from Salon. But the original plan was to go south after going west. But in the Salon, going south is blocked. Wait, the user tried going south and it said "You can't go that way." So maybe the Salon is surrounded on the west, east, and south, but what about north? The room description doesn't mention a north exit. Wait, the user came from the west (Launderette), so the Salon's west is blocked. The east exit is unblocked. So maybe the user should go east from Salon. But the original goal was to go west, then south, then west. Maybe the user needs to backtrack. Alternatively, maybe the cookhouse is in a different direction. Or perhaps the user needs to find the fly larva in the Salon? But the description says the safe is empty, bar is empty. Maybe the fly larva is in the Salon, but the user hasn't checked properly. Wait, the user's goal is to lift the fly larva from the cookhouse. So maybe the cookhouse is in a different room. The user needs to find the cookhouse. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the path. Let me retrace. The original plan was: start in Cubicle, go west (Study), then west (Launderette), then west (Salon). But in the Salon, going west is blocked. So maybe the user needs to go east from Salon. Let's try that. The user is in Salon, so going east would take them back to Launderette. Then from Launderette, maybe go south to the previous room? Wait, the Launderette has a portal leading south. So from Launderette, going south would take them back to Study. Then from Study, go west to Cubicle? But the original plan was to go west, then south, then west. Maybe the user is stuck because the path is blocked. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to find the cookhouse through another route. But the user hasn't found the cookhouse yet. The original goal is to lift the fly larva from the cookhouse. So perhaps the user needs to find the cookhouse. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go south from the Salon, but it's blocked. Wait, the Salon's description says "You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south." But the user tried and couldn't. Maybe the user is in a room where the exits are limited. Maybe the user needs to look for objects in the Salon that can help. The safe is empty, the bar is empty. Maybe the fly larva is in the Salon? But the user hasn't checked. Wait, the user's goal is to lift the fly larva from the cookhouse. So the cookhouse is a separate room. The user needs to find the cookhouse. But how? The current path is stuck. Maybe the user needs to go east from Salon, then south to the previous room, then west again? But that's going back. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to find another way. But the user is stuck in the Salon. The next action should be to go east, even though it's against the original plan, to find another path. So the next command is go east.

-= Cookhouse =-
You're now in the cookhouse.

You can make out a locked case, which looks usual, in the room.

There is an open portal leading north. There is an open hatch leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a fly larva on the floor.
