I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, make an attempt to go to the north. And then, make an attempt to travel east. If you can get through with that, travel south. After that, go to the east. Next, travel east. After that, make an effort to go to the east. And then, recover the candy bar from the floor of the laundry place. Alright, thanks!
