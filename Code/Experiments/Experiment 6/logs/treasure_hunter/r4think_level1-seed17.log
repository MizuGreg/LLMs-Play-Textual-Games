Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in a pantry, and the goal is to recover the fondue from the floor. The pantry has exits in all directions, but the user has been moving between the pantry and the office. They went north from the pantry into the office, then south back to the pantry. This back-and-forth might be a pattern.

The user is asking if they're making the right actions and if they're close to the goal. The fondue is on the floor, so maybe the key is to get to the pantry again and pick it up. But the problem is that the exits are blocked? Wait, the initial message said "You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south." So maybe the exits are blocked, but the advice is to try those directions. But when the user went north, they entered the office, which had an exit to the south. So maybe the pantry's exits are blocked except for the ones that lead to other areas.

But the user is stuck in a loop between the pantry and the office. The fondue is in the pantry, so maybe once they are in the pantry, they need to pick it up. But the problem is that the exits are blocked, so they can't leave. Wait, but the user is allowed to go north, south, east, or west. But the initial message says "You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south." So maybe the exits are blocked, but the game is suggesting trying those directions. However, when the user tried going north, they ended up in the office, which had an exit to the south. So maybe the pantry's exits are blocked except for the ones that lead to the office. But the user is stuck in a loop, going back and forth.

Wait, the user's last action was going south from the office back to the pantry. Now they are back in the pantry again. The fondue is on the floor. So maybe the correct action is to pick up the fondue. But the game's description doesn't mention picking it up. The user's goal is to recover the fondue from the floor. So perhaps once the user is in the pantry, they need to pick it up. But the game's commands are only movement. So maybe the user needs to go to the pantry, then pick up the fondue. But how? The game's instructions don't mention picking up items, only moving. Wait, maybe the user is supposed to collect the fondue by being in the same room as it. But the user is already in the pantry where the fondue is. So maybe the next step is to pick it up, but the game's commands don't include that. Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go to the pantry, then exit, but the exits are blocked. 

Wait, the initial problem says that the user is in the pantry, and the fondue is on the floor. The user's goal is to recover it. So maybe once the user is in the pantry, they can pick it up. But the game's commands are only movement. So perhaps the user needs to stay in the pantry and pick it up. But the game's message says "You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south." So maybe the exits are blocked, but the user is supposed to stay in the pantry and pick up the fondue. But how? The user can't pick it up unless they have a command for that. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go to the pantry, then exit through the unblocked exit. But the user is already in the pantry. The problem is that the user is stuck in a loop between the pantry and the office. The user needs to find a way to get out of the pantry to reach the fondue. Wait, no, the fondue is in the pantry. So the user is in the pantry, and the fondue is on the floor. So the user needs to pick it up. But the game's commands don't include picking up items. So maybe the user is supposed to just be in the pantry and the fondue is already there. But the user's goal is to recover it, so maybe the correct action is to go to the pantry and then pick it up. But since the user is already in the pantry, maybe the next step is to pick it up. However, the game's commands are only movement. So perhaps the user is supposed to stay in the pantry and the game will automatically collect the fondue. But the user's previous actions have been moving between the pantry and office. 

Wait, the user's last action was going south from the office back to the pantry. Now they are in the pantry again. The fondue is on the floor. So maybe the correct action is to pick it up. But the game's commands don't include that. So perhaps the user is supposed to just be in the pantry and the fondue is recovered. But the user hasn't done anything else. So maybe the answer is to go east, north, or south again. But the user is already in the pantry, and the exits are blocked. So maybe the user should try going east. But the initial message says to try going east, north, or south. So the user's next action is to go east. But the user is in the pantry, and the exits are blocked. So maybe the correct action is to go east. But the user has been going back and forth between the pantry and office. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go east from the pantry. But the initial message says "You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east." So maybe the user should go east. But the user is in the pantry, and the exits are blocked. So perhaps the user should go east, but that might lead to another room. However, the user's previous actions have led them to the office. So maybe the user needs to go east from the pantry. But the user hasn't tried that yet. So the next action should be to go east.
