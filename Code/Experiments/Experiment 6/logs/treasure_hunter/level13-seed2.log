Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an fast paced round of TextWorld? You do! Here is how to play! Your first objective is to take a trip east. After that, make an attempt to head south. And then, try to take a trip west. If you can do that, recover the latchkey from the floor of the studio. Alright, thanks!

-= Workshop =-
You arrive in a workshop. An ordinary one.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

-= Spare Room =-
You are in a spare room. A standard one. You begin looking for stuff.

You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a shelf. But there isn't a thing on it.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go south
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Steam Room =-
You find yourself in a steam room. A typical one.

You can make out a box, so there's that. You make out a rack. The rack is typical. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can see a table. The table is normal. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

-= Studio =-
You've just shown up in a studio. You can barely contain your excitement.

Oh, great. Here's a stand. The stand appears to be empty.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

There is a latchkey on the floor.
