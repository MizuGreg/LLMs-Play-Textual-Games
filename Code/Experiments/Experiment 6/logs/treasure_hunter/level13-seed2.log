Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an fast paced round of TextWorld? You do! Here is how to play! Your first objective is to take a trip east. After that, make an attempt to head south. And then, try to take a trip west. If you can do that, recover the latchkey from the floor of the studio. Alright, thanks!

-= Workshop =-
You arrive in a workshop. An ordinary one.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

-= Spare Room =-
You are in a spare room. A standard one. You begin looking for stuff.

You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a shelf. But there isn't a thing on it.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this TextWorld game. The goal is to go east, then south, then west, and recover the latchkey from the studio floor.

First, they started in the Workshop, went east to the Spare Room. Now, in the Spare Room, there are exits in all directions except maybe none? Wait, the description says there's an exit to the east, north, south, and west. So all four directions are exitable. But the user's next step is to try to head south after going east. Wait, the original objective was first go east, then south, then west. So after east, the next step is south. But in the current location (Spare Room), the user is supposed to try to go south. But the prompt says "make an attempt to head south." So the next action should be 'go south'.

But wait, the user is in the Spare Room. The original plan was after going east (to Spare Room), then try to go south. So the next command should be 'go south'. Then after that, if successful, go west. Then recover the latchkey. But the user needs to make sure each step is taken. The current location is Spare Room, so the next action is go south. The user's previous action was go east, leading here. So the next step is to go south. The answer should be 'go south'.
</think>go south
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Steam Room =-
You find yourself in a steam room. A typical one.

You can make out a box, so there's that. You make out a rack. The rack is typical. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can see a table. The table is normal. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game and has to navigate through different rooms. The original goal was to go east, then south, then west, and find the latchkey in the studio.

So far, they started in the Workshop, went east to the Spare Room, then south to the Steam Room. Now, in the Steam Room, the directions mentioned are east, north, and west. The user needs to continue following the path as per the original plan. The next step after Steam Room would be to go west, as per the initial instructions. But wait, the user's current location is the Steam Room. The original plan was after going south (from Spare Room to Steam Room), then try to go west. But in the Steam Room, the available exits are east, north, west. So going west from here would be the next step. But the user's previous action was going south from Spare Room to Steam Room. Now, the next step should be to go west. However, the user's last action was "go south", and the current room is Steam Room. The next step according to the plan is to go west. But the user needs to check if that's possible. The Steam Room's exits include west, so "go west" is allowed. So the next command should be "go west".
</think>go west

-= Studio =-
You've just shown up in a studio. You can barely contain your excitement.

Oh, great. Here's a stand. The stand appears to be empty.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

There is a latchkey on the floor.

Okay, let's see. The user has been moving through different rooms in the game: Workshop, Spare Room, Steam Room, and now the Studio. The original goal was to take a trip east, then south, then west, and finally recover the latchkey from the floor of the studio.

So far, the user went east from the Workshop to the Spare Room, then south to the Steam Room, then west to the Studio. Now they're in the Studio, and there's a latchkey on the floor. The next step should be to pick up the latchkey. But the instruction says to only output the action, like "take latchkey" or something similar. Wait, but the user's previous actions were all "go" commands. However, in the Studio, the latchkey is on the floor, so the correct action here is to take the latchkey. The user hasn't done that yet. The previous steps were moving around, and now they're in the room where the goal is. So the next action should be to take the latchkey. The system message says to only output the command, so it's just "take latchkey".
</think>take latchkey
