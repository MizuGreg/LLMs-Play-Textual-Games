-= Workshop =-
You've just walked into a workshop.

Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a locker. You can make out an opened portmanteau. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You can make out a mantelpiece. The mantelpiece is standard. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

Ah, the garage. This is some kind of garage, really great ordinary vibes in this place, a wonderful ordinary atmosphere. And now, well, you're in it. You start to take note of what's in the room.

-= Cookery =-
You've just sauntered into a cookery.

You scan the room for a chest, and you find a chest. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? Look over there! a platter. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You can make out a saucepan. The saucepan is typical. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north.

You find yourself in a scullery. A standard one.

Hey, want to see a fridge? Look over there, a fridge. The fridge is empty, what a horrible day! You can make out a bowl. The bowl is typical. The bowl appears to be empty. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

-= Cellar =-
You are in an usual kind of place. That is to say, you're in a cellar. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a rack. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing hasn't got anything on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the rack. You can make out a workbench. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Hm. Oh well

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

-= Office =-
You find yourself in an office. A typical kind of place.

A closed coffer is right there by you.

There is an open door leading east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.



>                                                                                                                                -= Office =-0/6
Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this TextWorld game and has been moving through different rooms: Workshop, Garage, Cookery, Scullery, Cellar, and now Office. The goal mentioned earlier was to lift the stick of butter from the kitchenette's floor and win. So far, the player has been moving around, but hasn't found the butter yet.

In the current Office room, there's a closed coffer and doors in several directions. The hints suggest trying north or south for unblocked exits. The user is asking if they're on the right track and if they're close to the goal. 

Looking at the path taken: Workshop → Garage → Cookery → Scullery → Cellar → Office. The kitchenette wasn't mentioned until the beginning in the Workshop. Maybe the butter is in a room that's yet to be explored. The Office has a coffer, which might be a place to look for items. Since the coffer is closed, perhaps the next step is to open it. But the user's previous actions were all about moving, not interacting with objects. The instructions said to "lift the stick of butter from the floor of the kitchenette," so maybe the kitchenette is a room that hasn't been visited yet. 

Wait, the user hasn't gone north from the Office yet. The Office's north exit is mentioned as unblocked. If the kitchenette is north of the Office, then going north from here might be the next step. Alternatively, the coffer might contain the butter. But the user hasn't tried opening it yet. However, the initial instructions mentioned moving west, then west again, then north, etc., so maybe the correct path is to continue moving north from the Office. 

The user's last action was "go east" from the Cellar to reach the Office. Now, in the Office, the possible exits are north, south, west (unblocked), and east (open door). The goal is to find the butter in the kitchenette. If the kitchenette is north of the Office, then going north would be the next step. Alternatively, maybe the coffer in the Office has the butter. But the user hasn't interacted with the coffer yet. However, the initial instructions didn't mention opening things, just moving. 

Given the previous pattern of moving in specific directions (west, west, north, north, east, then north again), the next logical step might be to go north from the Office. So the next command should be "go north".

-= Pantry =-
You arrive in a pantry. A standard kind of place.

You scan the room for a stand, and you find a stand. The stand is typical. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.

There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unblocked exit to the west.



>                                                                                                                                -= Pantry =-0/7

-= Dish-Pit =-
You've just sauntered into a dish-pit. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

Look over there! a freezer. You shudder, but continue examining the room.

There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.



>                                                                                                                                -= Dish-Pit =-0/8

-= Kitchenette =-
Well, here we are in a kitchenette.

You can make out a locked cabinet close by.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

There is a stick of butter on the floor.


>                                                                                                                                -= Kitchenette =-0/9
