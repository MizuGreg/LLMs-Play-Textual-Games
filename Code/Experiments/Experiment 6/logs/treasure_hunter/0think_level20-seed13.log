Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First off, go west. Okay, and then, move south. Then, move west. With that done, go north. Once you manage that, make an attempt to go north. That done, venture east. And then, head north. After that, go to the west. With that done, look and see that the trunk within the attic is wide open. After pulling open the trunk, pick up the keycard from the trunk. And once you've done that, you win!

You arrive in a scullery. Let's see what's in here.

Look over there! a case. You look around you, at all the containers and supporters, doors and objects, and you think to yourself. Why? Why Textworld? You can see a fridge. The fridge is empty! What a waste of a day!

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an unguarded exit to the south.
