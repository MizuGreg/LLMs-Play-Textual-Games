Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First off, go east. Once you succeed at that, try to take a trip east. Then, attempt to take a trip south. Then, attempt to go to the south. Then, make an effort to go south. And then, head west. Then, make an effort to move north. And then, go north. And then, lift the key from the floor of the kitchen. That's it!

-= Playroom =-
Okay, so you're in a playroom, cool, but is it usual? You better believe it is.

You see a closed dresser. Oh, great. Here's a coffer. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a recliner. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.
