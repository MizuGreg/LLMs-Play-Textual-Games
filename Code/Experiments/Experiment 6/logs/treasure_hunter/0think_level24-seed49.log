Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First, it would be fantastic if you could go south. With that over with, lift the sponge from the floor of the sauna. Got that? Good!

-= Dish-Pit =-
You find yourself in a dish-pit. A normal one. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a case. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You see an opened chest nearby. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this?

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

-= Sauna =-
You are in a sauna. A typical one. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."

Look over there! a rack. But the thing is empty.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the north. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

There is a sponge on the floor.
