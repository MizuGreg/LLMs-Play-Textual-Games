You are now playing a fast paced episode of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First stop, head north. After that, try to go west. Then, move west. With that over with, head west. Then, take the sandwich from the table within the kitchen. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Workshop =-
You arrive in a workshop. An ordinary kind of place. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

You make out a stand. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an unguarded exit to the south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

-= Bathroom =-
I never took you for the sort of person who would show up in a bathroom, but I guess I was wrong. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You see a board. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an unblocked exit to the south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

You're now in the shower. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

You make out a drawer. You see a case. The case is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You make out a dresser.

There is an open wooden door leading east. There is an open stone hatch leading west.

-= Kitchen =-
You've entered a kitchen. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a table. You see a sandwich on the table.

There is an open stone hatch leading east. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.
