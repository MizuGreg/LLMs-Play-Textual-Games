Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First, it would be fantastic if you could ensure that the passageway is open. After that, head south. After that, attempt to travel south. Then, head east. Next, attempt to go north. After that, venture north. Then, make an attempt to head east. After that, take the latchkey from the pan. Alright, thanks!

-= Dish-Pit =-
Well I'll be, you are in a place we're calling a dish-pit. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.



There is a closed passageway leading south. There is an open door leading north. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Laundry Place =-
You have walked into a laundry place. Not the laundry place you'd expect. No, this is a laundry place. You begin looking for stuff.

You can see an opened cabinet, which looks ordinary, in the corner. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You make out a table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

There is an open portal leading east. There is an open hatch leading north.



>                                                                                                                                -= Laundry Place =-0/5

There is an open gate leading north. There is an open portal leading west.

There is a loaf of bread on the floor.

-= Bathroom =-
You find yourself in a bathroom. A standard kind of place.

Were you looking for a board? Because look over there, it's a board. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is an open gateway leading north. There is an open gate leading south.



>                                                                                                                                -= Bathroom =-0/7
Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what the user is asking here. They want to know if I'm making the right actions so far and if I'm close to the goal. Then I need to respond with the next command.

First, I'll recap the steps taken so far. The user started in the Dish-Pit, opened the passageway, went south to Recreation Zone, then south again to Laundry Place, east to Bedroom, and north to Bathroom. The original instructions were to open the passageway, then go south, south again, east, north, north again, then take the latchkey from the pan.

Wait, in the current state, the user is in the Bathroom. The next steps according to the original instructions were after going north from the Bedroom (which was done) to take the latchkey from the pan. But in the Bathroom, there's a board mentioned, but no mention of a pan. Hmm, maybe the pan is in a different location. Let me check the previous rooms.

In the Laundry Place, there was an opened cabinet (empty) and a table (empty). In the Bedroom, there was a loaf of bread on the floor. The Bathroom has a board but nothing else. Maybe the pan is in the Laundry Place? Or perhaps the latchkey is in the Cabinet? But the cabinet was empty. Wait, the user's original instruction was to take the latchkey from the pan. So maybe the pan is in the Laundry Place, and the cabinet is a red herring.

But in the current Bathroom, the user is supposed to have already taken the latchkey. Wait, no. The original instructions said after going north from the Bedroom (which was done), then venture north again (so from Bathroom, go north?), then take the latchkey from the pan. But the user is in the Bathroom now. The next step would be to go north again from the Bathroom. Let me check the Bathroom's description again.

In the Bathroom, there's an open gateway leading north and an open gate leading south. So going north from here would be the next step. But the original instruction after the Bathroom was to take the latchkey from the pan. However, in the Bathroom, there's no mention of a pan. Maybe the pan is in the Laundry Place or the Bedroom. Alternatively, maybe the pan is in the Bathroom, but the user hasn't found it yet.

Wait, the user's original task was to "take the latchkey from the pan." So the pan must be in one of the rooms. Let me check each room again.

Dish-Pit: closed passageway south, open door north, exit west. No pan mentioned.

Recreation Zone: north passageway, south hatch. No pan.

Laundry Place: opened cabinet (empty), table (empty), portal east, hatch north. No pan.

Bedroom: loaf of bread on floor, gate north, portal west. No pan.

Bathroom: board, gateway north, gate south. No pan.

Hmm, maybe the pan is in the Bathroom? But the user hasn't found it yet. Alternatively, maybe the pan is in the Laundry Place's cabinet, but it's empty. Or perhaps the pan is in the Bedroom? The Bedroom has a loaf of bread, but no pan.

Wait, maybe the pan is in the Bathroom. The user is in the Bathroom now. The instruction was to take the latchkey from the pan. So perhaps the pan is in the Bathroom, and the user needs to find it. But the description of the Bathroom doesn't mention a pan. Maybe the user is supposed to look for it. But according to the current description, there's a board, but no pan. So maybe the user is missing something.

Alternatively, maybe the pan is in the Laundry Place's cabinet. But the cabinet is empty. Or maybe the pan is in the Recreation Zone? But that's not mentioned.

Wait, maybe the user is supposed to take the latchkey from the pan, which is in the Bathroom. But the description doesn't mention a pan. Maybe the user needs to look around. However, the user's current action is in the Bathroom, and the next step is to go north again. But according to the original instructions, after going north from the Bedroom (which was done), then venture north again (so from Bathroom, go north?), then take the latchkey from the pan. But if the pan is not in the Bathroom, then maybe the user is missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the pan is in the Laundry Place. The user was in the Laundry Place earlier. Maybe the pan is there, but the cabinet is empty. Maybe the pan is on the table? But the table is empty. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the pan is in the Bedroom. The user was in the Bedroom, but there's a loaf of bread, not a pan. So maybe the user is supposed to find the pan in the Bathroom, but it's not mentioned. This is confusing.

But according to the current state, the user is in the Bathroom. The next step according to the original instructions was to go north again (after the Bathroom), then take the latchkey from the pan. But if the pan isn't there, maybe the user is supposed to look for it. However, the user's next action should be to go north again. So the next command would be "go north" again. Then, perhaps in the next room, the pan is located. But the user hasn't found it yet. Alternatively, maybe the pan is in the Bathroom, and the user needs to check there.

But the user is in the Bathroom now. The original instruction was to take the latchkey from the pan. So maybe the pan is in the Bathroom, and the user needs to take it. But the description doesn't mention a pan. Maybe the user is supposed to look for it. However, the user's next action is to go north again. But the user is in the Bathroom, and the north gateway leads to the next room. So the next step is to go north again, then check if the pan is there. But the user hasn't found the pan yet. So maybe the user is supposed to proceed to the next room and check there.

Therefore, the next action is "go north".

-= Cubicle =-
I am sorry to announce that you are now in the cubicle.

You see a coffer. You make out an opened trunk. The trunk is empty! What a waste of a day!

There is an open gateway leading south. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east.



>                                                                                                                                -= Cubicle =-0/8

-= Cookhouse =-
Wow! You're in a cookhouse. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You make out a pan. The pan is ordinary. On the pan you see a latchkey. You scan the room, seeing a bowl. However, the bowl, like an empty bowl, has nothing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the bowl.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.
