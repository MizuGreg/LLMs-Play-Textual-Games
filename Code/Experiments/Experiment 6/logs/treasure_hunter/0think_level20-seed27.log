It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First thing I need you to do is to go to the east. And then, ensure that the wooden hatch in the salon is open. And then, go east. Following that, open the portal inside the scullery. And then, make an effort to go north. And then, open the hatch inside the studio. And then, go west. After that, make sure that the passageway within the kitchenette is ajar. Then, make an attempt to travel west. Then, retrieve the shadfly from the floor of the spare room. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Cubicle =-
