It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First off, make an attempt to head north. Then, retrieve the latchkey from the floor of the sauna. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Canteen =-
You're now in the canteen. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north.

-= Sauna =-
I never took you for the sort of person who would show up in a sauna, but I guess I was wrong.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

There is a latchkey on the floor.
