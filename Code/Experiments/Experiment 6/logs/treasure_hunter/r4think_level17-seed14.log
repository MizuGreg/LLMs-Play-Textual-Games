I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. Your first objective is to attempt to take a trip north. Then, open the portal within the laundromat. Having opened the portal, make an effort to venture north. Then, make an effort to move west. After that, travel north. After that, travel east. With that over with, retrieve the butterfly from the box within the workshop. That's it!

-= Canteen =-
Well, here we are in a canteen.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this TextWorld game and has followed a set of instructions to move through different areas. So far, they've gone from the Canteen to the Laundromat, opened the portal, and moved north to the Cellar. The next steps in their task were to move west, then north again, then east, and finally retrieve the butterfly from the workshop.

In the Cellar, the available exits are a portal south and a passageway west. The user's next action should be to go west as per the original plan. But the user is asking if they're on the right track and close to the goal. 

I need to confirm that moving west is the correct next step. The original instructions said after opening the portal and moving north to the Cellar, they should venture west. So the next command should be "go west". The user's current location is the Cellar, so moving west would take them to the passageway. Then, after that, they need to go north again, then east, and finally get the butterfly from the workshop. 

Since the user is asking if they're close, the answer is yes, they're following the correct path. The next action is to go west. I should only output the command, no explanations. So the response is "go west".

-= Office =-
You find yourself in an usual kind of place. That is to say, you're in an office.

You can see a desk. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

There is an open passageway leading east. There is an open gateway leading north.

-= Chamber =-
You find yourself in a chamber. An ordinary one.



There is an open gateway leading south. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Workshop =-
You've just shown up in a workshop.

You can see a box. The box contains a butterfly. You make out a locker. You can see a portmanteau.

You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.



>                                                                                                                                -= Workshop =-0/7

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps to navigate through the game. They started in the Canteen, went north to the Laundromat, opened the portal, and moved north again to the Cellar. Then they went west to the Office, north to the Chamber, and east to the Workshop. Now, in the Workshop, they see a box with a butterfly, which is the goal mentioned in the original task.

The user is asking if they're on the right track and close to the goal. Since the task was to retrieve the butterfly from the box in the workshop, they've reached that location. The next step would be to pick up the butterfly. But the game might require them to interact with the box. The available commands here are to go west, but the user needs to take the butterfly from the box. However, the game's input format requires only the command, like "take butterfly" or "open box". But in the previous steps, the user didn't use "take" but instead moved around. Wait, in the Workshop description, the box is mentioned as containing the butterfly. So the correct action is to take the butterfly from the box. But the user's previous actions were moving, so maybe they need to use the "take" command. However, the original instructions said to "retrieve the butterfly from the box within the workshop." So the next action should be to take the butterfly. But the system message says to only output the action, like "go north". So the correct command here is "take butterfly" or "open box"? The box is already open? The description says "a box. The box contains a butterfly." So maybe the user needs to take it. But in TextWorld, sometimes you have to open the box first. However, the description doesn't mention the box being closed. It just says the box contains a butterfly. So perhaps the user can take it directly. Therefore, the next action is to take the butterfly. But the user's previous actions were moving, so maybe the correct command is "take butterfly". However, the user might need to interact with the box. But according to the game's structure, the correct command here is "take butterfly".
