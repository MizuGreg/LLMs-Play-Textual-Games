You can see a locked drawer. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a shelf. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You see a counter. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. This always happens, here in TextWorld!

There is an open gate leading east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

You're now in a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You see a table. The table is standard. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.

There is an open portal leading east. There is an open hatch leading south. There is an open gate leading west.

You've just shown up in a salon.

You scan the room, seeing a recliner. The recliner is typical. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.
