Well, here we are in a vault. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me recap what's been done so far. The user started in the Dish-Pit, went west to the Office, then north to the Vault, east to the Basement, then east again to the Scullery, then east to the Bathroom, south to the Study, south again to the Cookhouse, west to the Chamber.

The goal was to go west, then north, then east, east again, south, south, west, pick up the gummy bear, and win. The user has followed the steps mostly. Now they're in the Chamber, which is the ninth room. The next step is to pick up the gummy bear on the floor. The prompt says to pick it up and then win. So the next action should be to take the gummy bear. But the available commands are to go in directions, but the gummy bear is on the floor. So the correct action is to pick it up. But the game might require using 'take' or 'pick up' as the command. However, the user's previous actions were all 'go directions', so maybe the correct command here is 'take gummy bear' or 'pick up gummy bear'. But the user's instructions say to only output the action, like "go north". So the correct command here is to pick up the gummy bear. But the game's environment might have specific commands. Since the user is in the Chamber, and the gummy bear is on the floor, the next step is to take it. So the answer should be 'take gummy bear' or 'pick up gummy bear'. But the user's previous actions were all 'go directions', so maybe the correct command is 'take gummy bear'.
</think>pick up gummy bear
