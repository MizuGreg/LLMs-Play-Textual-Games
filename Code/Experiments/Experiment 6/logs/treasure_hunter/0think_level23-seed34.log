Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an profound round of TextWorld? You do! Here is how to play! First, it would be great if you could try to go to the south. And then, head east. Then, venture east. After that, move south. Then, make an effort to travel south. That done, venture south. And then, pick up the key from the floor of the playroom. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Vault =-
You are in a vault. It seems to be pretty typical here. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.



There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

-= Cookery =-

You see a rack. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You see a workbench. The workbench appears to be empty. You see a rough shelf. But there isn't a thing on it. You make out a rack. The rack is rough. On the rough rack you make out a passkey.

There is an open gateway leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.
