Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to go east. Following that, retrieve the latchkey from the pan. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Cubicle =-
I am sorry to announce that you are now in the cubicle.

You see a coffer. You make out an opened trunk. The trunk is empty! What a waste of a day!

There is an open gateway leading south. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east.

-= Cookhouse =-
Wow! You're in a cookhouse. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You make out a pan. The pan is ordinary. On the pan you see a latchkey. You scan the room, seeing a bowl. However, the bowl, like an empty bowl, has nothing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the bowl.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they need to retrieve a latchkey from a pan in the Cookhouse. The previous steps were going east from the Cubicle, which led them to the Cookhouse. Now, in the Cookhouse, they see a pan with a latchkey on it. The goal is to get that latchkey.

The user is asking if they're on the right track and if they're close to the goal. From the description, the pan is in the Cookhouse, and the latchkey is on the pan. So the next logical step is to pick up the latchkey. The user's last action was going east, and now they're in the Cookhouse. The prompt says to retrieve the latchkey from the pan, so the next command should be to take the latchkey. The available directions are west, but the user needs to interact with the pan first. Since the game allows taking items, the correct action is to take the latchkey from the pan. The user should say "take latchkey from pan" or similar. But the exact command depends on the game's syntax. Since the user previously went east, and now they're in the Cookhouse, the next step is to take the latchkey. The answer should be "take latchkey from pan".
