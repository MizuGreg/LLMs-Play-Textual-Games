You are now playing a life changing game of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First step, ensure that the gate in the studio is open. After that, try to take a trip west. Then, venture north. And then, travel west. Then, move north. That done, go north. With that over with, lift the loaf of bread from the floor of the cellar. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Studio =-
Guess what, you are in the place we're calling the studio. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.



There is a closed gate leading west. There is an open door leading east.

Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

You find yourself in an office. An usual one.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a portmanteau. The portmanteau is empty, what a horrible day!

There is an open gate leading east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

You find yourself in a canteen. A typical kind of place.

You can see a platter. The platter is usual. But the thing is empty. Hey, want to see a rack? Look over there, a rack. But the thing is empty. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You make out a chair. The chair is ordinary. The chair appears to be empty. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a saucepan. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.
