Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, the user is stuck in the game because they're trying to "lift the worm" but the system doesn't recognize it. Let me check the previous steps.

The user was told to "lift the worm from the floor of the kitchenette." The game's response was "That's not a verb I recognise." So maybe the correct command is "take the worm" or "pick up the worm" instead of "lift." But the user has tried "lift the worm" multiple times, and it's not working. 

Looking at the game's context, the worm is on the floor. The possible actions here might be "take" or "pick up." The user might need to use the verb "take" instead of "lift." Alternatively, maybe the game expects "lift" without the object, but that's less likely. 

Since the user has already tried "lift the worm" and it's not working, the next step is to try "take the worm." If that doesn't work either, maybe the game is expecting a different phrasing. But based on standard text adventures, "take" is a common verb for picking up items. 

So the correct action here is likely "take the worm." The user needs to try that. Let me make sure there's no other possible command. The game's previous messages mention "lift the worm," but the system doesn't recognize it. So the user should try "take the worm" instead.
