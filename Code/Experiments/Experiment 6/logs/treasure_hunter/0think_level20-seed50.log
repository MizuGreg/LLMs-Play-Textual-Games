Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an life changing round of TextWorld? You do! First, it would be good if you could try to go south. And then, open the door within the vault. After that, head south. After that, go east. After that, travel north. And then, open the gate within the sauna. And then, go to the north. And then, go to the east. And then, make an attempt to travel south. Then, retrieve the peanut from the floor of the laundromat. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

There is an open portal leading south. There is an open hatch leading west.

Hey, want to see a saucepan? Look over there, a saucepan. The saucepan is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the saucepan. Look over there! a chair. There's something about an object in a room that's just so... TextWorld. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm. Oh well

>                                                                                                                                -= Office =-0/8

There is a peanut on the floor.
