You are now playing a life changing episode of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to venture west. Then, go south. And then, retrieve the potato from the floor of the office. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Cookery =-
Okay, so you're in a cookery, cool, but is it typical? You better believe it is.

You can see a platter. The platter is normal. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You can see a plate. However, the plate, like an empty plate, has nothing on it. You can see a board. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is an open stone hatch leading east. There is an open passageway leading west.

AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go west

-= Salon =-
You've just shown up in a salon. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You make out an opened chest, which looks ordinary, nearby. The chest is empty, what a horrible day!

There is an open passageway leading east. There is an open door leading north. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

go south

-= Office =-
You find yourself in an office. A normal kind of place.

You see a closed bureau in the room.

There is an unblocked exit to the north.

There is a potato on the floor.
