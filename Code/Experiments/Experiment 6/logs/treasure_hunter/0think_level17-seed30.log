Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First thing I need you to do is to try to move north. Following that, ensure that the hatch within the canteen is open. And then, make an effort to move west. With that over with, ensure that the portal is open. And then, take a trip west. With that done, move south. With that accomplished, pick up the latchkey from the floor of the closet. That's it!

-= Dish-Pit =-
You've entered a dish-pit. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

You make out a saucepan. The saucepan is usual. The saucepan appears to be empty. You scan the room for a counter, and you find a counter. The counter is normal. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is an open gate leading east. There is an open door leading north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.
