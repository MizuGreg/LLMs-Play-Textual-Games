Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. Your first objective is to venture west. After that, retrieve the broom from the floor of the basement. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Bedroom =-
You are in a bedroom. A typical kind of place.



There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

>                                                                                                                                -= Bedroom =-0/1
AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go west
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Basement =-
You arrive in a basement. A normal one.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a broom and a fly larva on the floor.


>                                                                                                                                -= Basement =-0/2
Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in the basement, and they need to retrieve the broom. The current room has a broom and a fly larva on the floor. The original goal was to venture west, then get the broom from the basement. So far, they went west from the bedroom to the basement. Now, in the basement, they need to get the broom. Since the broom is on the floor, the next step is to pick it up. But the game might require moving to the correct location first. Wait, the basement has an unguarded exit to the east and south. But the broom is already in the basement. So maybe the player just needs to pick up the broom here. But the command might be to take the broom. However, the user's previous action was going west, and now they're in the basement. The prompt says to retrieve the broom from the floor of the basement. So the correct action is to take the broom. But the game might require moving to the correct position first. Wait, the user is already in the basement, and the broom is on the floor. So the next action should be to take the broom. But the user's last action was going west, and the current room is the basement. So the next step is to take the broom. But the user's previous message says that the broom is on the floor. So the correct command is "take broom". But the user's instructions say to only output the action. So the answer should be "take broom".
