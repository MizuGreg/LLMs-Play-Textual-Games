Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First off, venture south. After that, try to go west. That done, lift the gummy bear from the floor of the chamber. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Study =-
Well I'll be, you are in a place we're calling a study. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a display.

There is an unguarded exit to the north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

-= Cookhouse =-
Guess what, you are in the place we're calling the cookhouse.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing a text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and perform specific actions to win. The current scenario is in the Cookhouse, and the user has already gone south from the Study. The goal is to lift the gummy bear from the floor of the chamber and then win.

First, I need to track the user's progress. They started in the Study, went south to the Cookhouse. The next steps mentioned in the initial instructions were to go west, then lift the gummy bear. But in the Cookhouse, the available exits are east, north, south, and west. The user's current position is the Cookhouse.

The user's previous action was "go south", which took them to the Cookhouse. Now, the next step according to the original instructions was to go west. However, in the Cookhouse description, the user is told that the west entrance is unblocked. So, the correct next step would be to go west. But the user might be confused because the initial instruction said to go west after going south, but the current room is Cookhouse. Wait, the original instructions said: venture south (which the user did), then try to go west. So after going south to Cookhouse, the next action should be west. But the user's next move is to go west from the Cookhouse. However, the user's last input was "go south", and the current room is Cookhouse. The user's next action should be to go west. But the assistant's previous response was "go south", which the user did. Now, the user is in the Cookhouse, and the next step is to go west. But the user hasn't done that yet. However, the user's last message was asking if they're on the right track, so the assistant needs to respond with the next action.

Wait, the user's last message was the Cookhouse description, and the user is asking if they're making the right moves. The original plan was: go south (done), then go west (next step). So the next action should be "go west". But in the Cookhouse, the user is told that west is unblocked. So the correct next step is to go west. Then, after that, they need to lift the gummy bear. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action is "go west".

-= Chamber =-
You've entered a chamber.

You make out a locker!

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

There is a gummy bear on the floor.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game, and they've been moving through different rooms: first the study, then the cookhouse, and now the chamber. The goal is to lift the gummy bear from the floor of the chamber and then win.

So far, the user has gone south from the study, which took them to the cookhouse. Then they went west from the cookhouse into the chamber. Now, in the chamber, they see a gummy bear on the floor. The next step according to the original instructions was to lift the gummy bear after moving west. But wait, the user's previous action was going west, which led them to the chamber. Now they need to pick up the gummy bear.

Looking at the current room description, the chamber has exits to the north, east, west, and there's a gummy bear on the floor. The user's next action should be to pick up the gummy bear. But the game's commands might require using a specific verb like "take" or "lift". However, the user's previous commands were just directional (go south, go west), so maybe the correct command here is "take gummy bear" or "lift gummy bear". But the system message says to only output the action, like "go north", so perhaps the correct command is "take gummy bear" or "lift gummy bear". But I need to check the game's possible commands. Since the user has been using "go" commands, maybe the correct action here is "take gummy bear". Alternatively, maybe the game expects "lift" instead. But the user's previous actions were just directions, so maybe the correct command is "take gummy bear". However, the user's last action was "go west", which led them to the chamber where the gummy bear is. So the next step is to pick it up. The correct command would be "take gummy bear" or "lift gummy bear". But the user's previous commands were just "go" followed by direction, so maybe the correct action here is "take gummy bear". But I need to make sure. The original instructions said "lift the gummy bear from the floor of the chamber. And once you've done that, you win!" So the correct action is to lift it. Therefore, the next command should be "lift gummy bear".

That's not a verb I recognise.

Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game, and they've been given a series of commands to follow. The goal is to lift the gummy bear in the Chamber and then win.

First, the user started by going south, then west, which led them to the Chamber. Now, they see a gummy bear on the floor. The previous attempt was to "lift gummy bear," but the system said that's not a recognized verb. So, I need to think about the correct command format here.

In text adventures, typical commands are like "take" or "pick up" for picking up items. Since "lift" isn't working, maybe the correct verb is "take" or "pick up." The game might expect "take gummy bear" or "pick up gummy bear." Let me check the previous interactions. The user was told to "lift the gummy bear from the floor of the chamber." But the system didn't accept "lift." So perhaps the correct command is "take" instead.

Alternatively, maybe the item is in a locker, and the user needs to open the locker first. Wait, the description says there's a locker in the Chamber. So maybe the gummy bear is inside the locker, and the user needs to open it first. But the user saw the gummy bear on the floor, so maybe that's a different item. Hmm.

Wait, the user's last action was in the Chamber, where they saw a gummy bear on the floor. The correct command should be to pick it up. Since "lift" didn't work, maybe "take" is the right verb. Let me try that. So the next command should be "take gummy bear." That's the most likely correct action here.
