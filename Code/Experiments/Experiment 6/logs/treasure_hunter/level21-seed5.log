Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First off, venture south. After that, try to go west. That done, lift the gummy bear from the floor of the chamber. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Study =-
Well I'll be, you are in a place we're calling a study. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a display.

There is an unguarded exit to the north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go south

-= Cookhouse =-
Guess what, you are in the place we're calling the cookhouse.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Chamber =-
You've entered a chamber.

You make out a locker!

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

There is a gummy bear on the floor.
