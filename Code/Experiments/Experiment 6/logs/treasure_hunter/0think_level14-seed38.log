Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an exciting round of TextWorld? You do! Here is your task for today. First, it would be good if you could make sure that the portal in the lounge is opened. After that, move west. Then, try to go north. If you can do that, make an effort to move east. Then, pick-up the passkey from the floor of the office. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Lounge =-
You find yourself in a lounge. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

You smell an intriguing smell, and follow it to a bar. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You can make out a mantelpiece. The mantelpiece is standard. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the mantelpiece! oh well.

There is a closed portal leading west. There is an open passageway leading south. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north.

-= Office =-
You've just sauntered into an office.

You can make out a coffer. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a chair. There's something about an object in a room that's just so... TextWorld. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a chair in a room.

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

There is a passkey and a latchkey on the floor.
