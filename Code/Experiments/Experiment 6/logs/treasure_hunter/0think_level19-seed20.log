Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, make absolutely sure that the hatch is open. Then, take a trip east. With that over with, make an attempt to venture east. Once you succeed at that, open the gate in the study. Then, make an attempt to go to the north. Once you manage that, attempt to go to the west. With that over with, take a trip north. With that over with, go north. And then, pick up the loaf of bread from the floor of the launderette. Once that's all handled, you can stop!
