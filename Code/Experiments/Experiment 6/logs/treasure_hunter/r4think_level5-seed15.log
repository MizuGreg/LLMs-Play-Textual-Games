You are now playing a exciting game of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First, it would be great if you could go west. After that, attempt to head north. And then, lift the banana from the floor of the workshop. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Canteen =-
You find yourself in a canteen. A normal kind of place. You start to take note of what's in the room.



There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go west
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Kitchenette =-
Fancy seeing you here. Here, by the way, being the kitchenette.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. There is an unguarded exit to the north.

There is a bowl on the floor.

AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go north
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Workshop =-
You find yourself in a workshop. A typical kind of place.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

There is a banana on the floor.


>                                                                                                                                -= Workshop =-0/3
Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me think through this. The user has been moving through different rooms: canteen, kitchenette, now the workshop. The goal is to lift the banana from the floor of the workshop. So far, they've gone west from the canteen, then north to the kitchenette, then north again to the workshop. In the workshop, there's a banana on the floor.

The next step would be to pick up the banana. But the prompt says to only output the action. So the correct command here is "take banana" or "lift banana". But in TextWorld-style commands, it's usually "take" for picking up items. However, the user's previous actions were "go west", "go north", so maybe "take banana" is the right command here. Let me check the previous messages. In the workshop description, it says "There is a banana on the floor." So the correct action is to take it. The user's last action was "go north", leading to the workshop. Now, the next command should be "take banana" to pick it up and complete the goal.
