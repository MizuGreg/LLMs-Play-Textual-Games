Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game and has to follow a series of steps. So far, they've checked the bathroom gateway, opened it, went west to the kitchen, opened the hatch there, and went west again to the office. Now, in the office, there's a closed portal leading north. The next step according to the initial task was to open the portal in the office and then venture north. So the user needs to open the portal first.

Looking at the current scene in the office: the user can see a display, there's an open hatch leading east and a closed portal north. The next action should be to open the portal. The user's previous actions have been opening things when they were closed, so following that pattern, they should open the portal here. Then, after opening it, they can go north as per the instructions. So the next command should be "open portal".

There is a closed door leading north. There is an open portal leading south.

Okay, let's recap the steps the user has taken so far. The original task was to follow a sequence of actions: check the bathroom gateway, go west, open the kitchen hatch, go west again, open the office portal, go north, check the attic door, and then proceed north again. Then, recover the potato from the salon.

So far, the user has opened the bathroom gateway, gone west to the kitchen, opened the kitchen hatch, gone west to the office, opened the office portal, gone north to the attic, opened the attic door. Now, the next step according to the original plan was to venture north again from the attic. But the current location is the attic, and the user just opened the door leading north. The next action should be to go north through that door. However, the user is at the attic, and the door is closed but just opened. So the correct next step is to go north. The user has already done the previous steps, so going north from the attic is the next logical move. The user might be approaching the salon, where the potato is located. So the next command should be "go north".

-= Salon =-
Guess what, you are in the place we're calling the salon.

You make out a bookshelf. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

There is an open door leading south. There is an open gate leading east.

There is a potato on the floor.
