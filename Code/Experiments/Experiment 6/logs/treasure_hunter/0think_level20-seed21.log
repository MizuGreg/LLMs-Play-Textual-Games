Welcome to TextWorld! Here is how to play! First of all, you could, like, open the gate in the cellar. Then, travel east. After that, try to travel south. Then, make an attempt to head east. After that, pick up the key from the floor of the bedroom. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Cellar =-
You arrive in a cellar. A normal one. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

You can see a closed cabinet. What's that over there? It looks like it's a trunk. You make out a stand. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

There is a closed gate leading east. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

There is an open passageway leading south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

What's that over there? It looks like it's a board. The board is ordinary. On the board you see a sponge.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

-= Cellar =-
You arrive in a cellar. A normal one. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

You can see a closed cabinet. What's that over there? It looks like it's a trunk. You make out a stand. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

There is an open gate leading east. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.
