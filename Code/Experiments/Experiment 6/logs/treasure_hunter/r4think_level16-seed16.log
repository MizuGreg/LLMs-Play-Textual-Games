Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, make sure that the portal inside the cellar is open. After that, make an effort to move south. Then, move west. Then, make an attempt to go to the north. Once you succeed at that, head west. And then, pick-up the peanut from the floor of the studio. Got that? Good!

-= Cellar =-
I am pleased to announce that you are now in the cellar.



There is a closed portal leading south. There is an open hatch leading north.

-= Kitchenette =-
Well, here we are in a kitchenette.



There is an open portal leading north. There is an open passageway leading west.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game, and they've been following the instructions to open the portal in the cellar and then move south. So far, they've opened the portal and moved south into the kitchenette. Now, the current location is the kitchenette, which has an open portal north and an open passageway west.

The user is asking if they're making the right moves and if they're close to the goal. The original goal was to pick up the peanut in the studio. Let me recap the steps given initially: open the cellar portal, go south, west, north, west, then pick up the peanut. 

So far, they've done: open portal (cellar), go south (kitchenette). Next steps according to the initial plan are move west, then north, then west again. But in the kitchenette, the available directions are north (portal) and west (passageway). So moving west from the kitchenette would be the next logical step. Then, from there, they might encounter the north direction again, leading towards the studio. 

The user is asking if they're on the right track. Since they've followed the initial instructions correctly, moving west from the kitchenette makes sense. The next action should be to go west. That would take them into the next area, which might be the studio or another part of the map. Once there, they can proceed to pick up the peanut. 

I need to make sure that the next command is "go west" to continue following the planned path. The user might be confused if they take a different direction, but sticking to the original plan seems correct. So the answer should be "go west".

-= Cubicle =-
Guess what, you are in the place we're calling the cubicle. You begin looking for stuff.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a safe. You can see a closed locker. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a desk. But the thing is empty.

There is an open passageway leading east. There is an open gateway leading north. There is an unguarded exit to the west.
