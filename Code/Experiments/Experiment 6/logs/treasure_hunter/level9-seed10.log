You have entered an attic. Not the attic you'd expect. No, this is an attic. The room is well lit.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game called TextWorld. The goal is to move south, then west, then south again, east, and pick up the carrot from the bedchamber. So far, they've gone from the basement to the attic. The current room is the attic, which is well lit. The prompt says they need an unguarded exit and suggests trying north, south, or west. There's also a latchkey on the floor.

The user is asking if they're making the right moves and if they're close to the goal. The previous actions were go south from the basement, which took them to the attic. Now, in the attic, they need to try one of the directions: north, south, west. The next step would be to follow the sequence mentioned in the initial instructions. The original plan was to go south, then west, then south, then east, then pick up the carrot.

But in the attic, the possible directions are north, south, west. The user's next move should be to go west, as per the initial plan. But wait, the user is in the attic. Let me check the initial instructions again. The first objective was to move south, then west. So after entering the attic, the next step would be to go west. But the user is in the attic, and the directions available are north, south, west. So the next action should be west. However, the user is asking if they're close to the goal. The current position is the attic. The original plan was to go south (from basement to attic), then west. So after the attic, going west would be the next step. But the user is in the attic, so the next move should be west. But the user is asking if they're making the right moves. The answer is yes, because they've done the first two steps: south then west. Wait, no. The first objective was to move south (from basement), then west (from basement?), but the user went south to the attic. So maybe the sequence is: basement -> attic (south), then from attic, go west. Then from there, maybe south again, then east, then pick up the carrot. So the next action should be west. But the user is in the attic, and the directions are north, south, west. So the next move is west. But the user is asking if they're close. The answer is yes, because they've done the first two steps. So the next action is west. But the user is in the attic, so going west from there. The user's next command should be "go west".
</think>go west

-= Spare Room =-
You find yourself in a spare room. A typical one.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.



>                                                                                                                                -= Spare Room =-0/3

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game, and they've been moving through different rooms: basement, attic, spare room. The original goal was to move south, then west, then south again, east, and pick up the carrot in the bedchamber.

So far, they went south from the basement to the attic, then west to the spare room. Now, in the spare room, the prompt says there's an exit to the east, and they need an unguarded exit, suggesting they should go south. The user is asking if they're on the right track and close to the goal.

The next action should be to go south from the spare room. That's the next step in the original plan. The user has already done south, west, and then south again. Wait, the original steps were: move south (basement to attic), then west (attic to spare room), then south (spare room to... where? Maybe a bedroom?), then east, then pick up the carrot. So going south from the spare room would be the next step. The user is asking if they're close, so the answer is yes, and the next command is go south.
</think>go south

-= Chamber =-
Okay, so you're in a chamber, cool, but is it usual? You better believe it is. You begin looking for stuff.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text adventure game. The original goal was to move south, then west, then south again, then east, and pick up the carrot in the bedchamber. So far, the user has gone south from the basement to the attic, then west to the spare room, then south to the chamber. Now, in the chamber, the prompt says there's an exit to the east that's unblocked and suggests going north instead.

The user's next action needs to be determined. The current room is the Chamber. The previous steps were following the instructions: first south, then west, then south again. The next step in the original plan was to go east. But in the current room, the exit to the east is mentioned as unblocked. However, the prompt also suggests trying north. But the user's goal is to go east next. However, maybe the path requires moving north first? Or maybe the east exit is blocked? Wait, the prompt says "There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked." So the east exit is available. But the user's next step in the original plan was to go east. However, the current room's description says "You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded." Maybe the north exit is unguarded, but the east is also unblocked. But the user's original plan was to go east after the south move. So maybe the correct next step is to go east. But the user has to follow the game's indications. However, the user's previous actions were following the directions given in the room. So in the Chamber, the user should go east as per the original plan. But the prompt here is suggesting going north. Wait, maybe the user needs to check if the east exit is indeed available. The prompt says "There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked." So the user can go east. But the original plan was to go east after the south move. So the next action should be east. But the user is in the Chamber, and the original goal was to pick up the carrot in the bedchamber. So maybe the bedchamber is a different room. But the user hasn't reached it yet. So the next step is to go east. But the prompt here says "You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded." Maybe the user is supposed to go north first? But the original plan was to go east. Hmm. Maybe the user needs to go east. The current room is Chamber, and the exit to the east is unblocked. So the next action should be go east. But the user's previous steps were going south, west, south. Now, the next step in the original plan was to go east. So the answer is go east. But the prompt here is suggesting north. However, the user's original plan is to go east. So maybe the correct action is go east. But the user has to follow the game's indications. The prompt says "There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked." So the user can go east. Therefore, the next action is go east.

-= Bedchamber =-
Well, here we are in the bedchamber.



There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

There is a carrot on the floor.

Okay, let's see. The user has been moving through different rooms in the game. The original goal was to move south, then west, then south again, then east, and finally pick up the carrot in the bedchamber.

So far, they've gone from the basement to the attic, then to the spare room, then to the chamber, and now they're in the bedchamber. The current room has exits to the north and west, and there's a carrot on the floor. The next step should be to pick up the carrot. But the user's last action was moving east to get here. Wait, the original plan was after moving south again (from the chamber), then east, then pick up the carrot. But in the current room, the carrot is on the floor. So the correct action here is to take the carrot. The command should be "take carrot" or "get carrot". But the game might use "take" as the verb. Let me check the previous interactions. The user was told to "pick up the carrot", so the correct command is likely "take carrot". But I need to make sure. The previous actions were all "go" commands. However, in the bedchamber, the carrot is on the floor, so the player needs to pick it up. Therefore, the next action should be to take the carrot.
