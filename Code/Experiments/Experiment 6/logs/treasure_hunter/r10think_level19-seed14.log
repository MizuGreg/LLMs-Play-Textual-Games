You are now playing a exciting game of TextWorld! First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to go east. And then, ensure that the gate is open. And then, try to travel north. After that, open the portal. After that, make an effort to venture north. After that, make an attempt to head west. Following that, go to the north. Okay, and then, take a trip east. Next, recover the butterfly from the box in the workshop. And if you do that, you're the winner!

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game and has been following a set of instructions. So far, they've gone east from the parlor to the canteen, then tried to go north but had to open the gate. They opened the gate, went north again, and now they're in a cubicle. The cubicle has a closed portal north and an open gate south.

The user is asking if they're making the right moves and if they're close to the goal. The goal is to recover the butterfly from the box in the workshop. Let's recap the steps taken so far:

1. Start in the parlor, go east to the canteen.
2. Open the gate to go north into the cubicle.
3. Now, in the cubicle, the portal north is closed. The user tried to go north again but was told to open the portal first.

So the next logical step would be to open the portal in the cubicle. Once that's done, they can proceed north. After that, they might need to explore further until they reach the workshop where the butterfly is kept. But according to the initial instructions, after opening the portal, they should venture north again, then west, then north again, and finally go east to the workshop.

But in the current state, they're in the cubicle with the portal north closed. The immediate next action should be to open that portal. Once it's open, they can go north. Then, following the previous steps, they might need to go west, north again, and then east to the workshop. However, the user's current position is the cubicle, so the immediate action is to open the portal. After that, go north. Then, depending on what's there, maybe go west, north, etc., until they reach the workshop.

So the correct next action here is to open the portal in the cubicle. The user has to do that before proceeding north. The previous attempt to go north without opening the portal was blocked, so the next step is to open it.
