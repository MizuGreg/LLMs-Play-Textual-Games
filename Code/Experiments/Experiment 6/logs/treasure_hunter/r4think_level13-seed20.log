I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is how to play! First step, take a trip west. And then, head north. That done, venture north. And then, lift the loaf of bread from the floor of the launderette. Alright, thanks!

-= Chamber =-
You've just sauntered into a chamber.

You can see a desk. The desk is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open portal leading north. There is an open gate leading south. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they've been moving between rooms. The goal mentioned earlier was to lift a loaf of bread from a launderette. But so far, the player has been moving west and east in a loop between the Chamber and Playroom. The current room is the Chamber again, with a desk and exits north and south.

The user is asking if the actions so far are correct and if they're close to the goal. The challenge here is that the game's environment seems to have repetitive rooms, maybe a loop. The desk in the Chamber is described as usual, with nothing taken off it, but the user's previous actions haven't found any objects except maybe the bread. Wait, the original instruction said to lift the bread from the launderette, but the current rooms don't mention a launderette. Maybe the bread is in a different location.

Looking at the exits: north is a portal, south is a gate. The user has been going west and east, which might not be leading towards the bread. The original plan was to go west, then north, then north again, then lift the bread. But the current rooms don't have the bread yet. Maybe the bread is in a room that's accessible via the north portal. However, the user is stuck in a loop between Chamber and Playroom. 

Since the user is asking if they're on the right track, the assistant needs to determine if continuing the loop is effective. Alternatively, maybe the bread is in the Playroom. But the Playroom description doesn't mention it. The desk in the Chamber is empty. The user needs to find the bread, which might be in a different room. The next step could be to go north through the portal, as that's the direction mentioned in the initial instructions. But the user has been going west and east, which might not be the right path. 

Wait, the initial instructions said: first step, take a trip west. Then head north. Then venture north again. Then lift the bread. So maybe after going west, the next step is north. But in the current scenario, the user is in the Chamber again after going west and east multiple times. Perhaps the correct path is to go north from the Chamber through the portal. But the user hasn't tried that yet. The previous actions were moving west and east, which might not be leading towards the bread. 

So the next action should be to go north through the portal in the Chamber, as that's the direction mentioned in the initial plan. The user might be stuck in a loop because they're not progressing north. Therefore, the correct next step is to go north.

Well, here we are in a bar.

You make out a locked dresser.

There is an open portal leading south. There is an open passageway leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the north.

Welcome to the basement. Let's see what's in here.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text adventure game, and their goal is to lift a loaf of bread from a launderette. So far, they've been moving between rooms like the Chamber, Playroom, and now the Bar and Basement. The current room is the Basement, which has an exit to the north and east, and a passageway south.

The user is asking if their actions so far are correct and if they're close to the goal. The previous steps involved moving west and east, which might have been part of a loop. Now, they're in the Basement. The key is to find the bread, which was mentioned in the initial instructions. The launderette is probably a specific location, maybe in a room with a launderette description.

Looking at the current room, the Basement has an exit to the north and east. The user might need to go north or east to find the bread. The initial plan was to go west, then north, then north again. But after several loops, they're in the Basement. Maybe the bread is in the north exit of the Basement. Alternatively, the launderette could be in a room that's accessible from here. Since the user hasn't found the bread yet, they need to explore further. The next logical step would be to go north from the Basement, as that's the direction mentioned in the initial plan. So the correct action is to go north.

-= Launderette =-
You find yourself in a launderette. An usual one.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

There is a loaf of bread on the floor.
