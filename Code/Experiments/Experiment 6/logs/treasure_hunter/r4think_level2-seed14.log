Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game where they need to lift the nest of bugs from the office floor. So far, they've moved from the Office to the Cellar, then to the Canteen, and now to the Chamber. Each time, they've been going east, but the last move was to the Chamber from the Canteen, and the available exit is west.

The user is asking if they're making the right moves and if they're close to the goal. Let me think about the environment. The original goal was to lift the bugs from the office floor. The initial location was the Office, which had the nest. Then they went east to the Cellar, then east again to the Canteen, and then east again to the Chamber. But in the Chamber, the only unblocked exit is west. That suggests that maybe the path back is through the west direction. But the user is now in the Chamber, and the next step would be to go west back to the Canteen. But the user is asking if they're close to the goal. 

Wait, maybe the nest is still in the Office. The user has moved away from the Office, so maybe they need to find a way back. The current location is the Chamber, which is probably a part of the building that's further from the Office. So going west back to the Canteen, then maybe south or east again to get back to the Office. But the user is in the Chamber, and the only exit is west. So the next logical step is to go west to the Canteen. Then from the Canteen, they can go south or east. But the original exit from the Office was east, which led to the Cellar. So maybe the user needs to find a way back to the Office. 

Alternatively, maybe the Chamber is part of the path leading to the Office. But the user is now in the Chamber, and the only exit is west. So the next action should be to go west back to the Canteen. Then, from the Canteen, they can go south to the Cellar, then east to the Office. Once back in the Office, they can lift the nest. So the user is not close yet, but they need to backtrack. The next action is to go west from the Chamber to the Canteen.
