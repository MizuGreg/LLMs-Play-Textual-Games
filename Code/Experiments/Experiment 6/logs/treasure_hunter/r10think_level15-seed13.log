Welcome to TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First, it would be a great idea if you could attempt to head south. With that done, make an effort to take a trip west. Then, travel south. With that over with, make an effort to venture east. And then, move east. Then, pick-up the passkey from the floor of the bar. That's it!

-= Cookhouse =-
You find yourself in a cookhouse. A standard one.

You can see a closed chest in the corner. You see a counter. The counter is ordinary. But the thing is empty. Hm. Oh well

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this TextWorld game and has been moving around different rooms. The original task was to go south, then west, then south again, then east, then east again, and finally pick up the passkey from the bar's floor.

So far, the user has been moving between rooms: starting in the Cookhouse, then Studio, Scullery, Chamber, Laundromat, back and forth. They've been going south, west, east, north, etc. But they haven't found the passkey yet. The current location is the Scullery again, and the next step would be to check if they're close to the passkey.

Looking at the rooms they've visited: Cookhouse, Studio, Scullery, Chamber, Laundromat, Attic, back to Scullery. The passkey is supposed to be in the bar's floor. Wait, the initial instruction said "pick-up the passkey from the floor of the bar." So the bar is probably a room they haven't visited yet. 

But in the current path, they've been moving between rooms without encountering the bar. The user might be going in circles. The challenge is to find the bar room and then pick up the passkey. Since the user is in the Scullery again, maybe they need to go north to the Attic again, but the Attic's description mentions a trunk, not a bar. Alternatively, maybe the bar is in the Studio or another room. 

Wait, in the Studio, there's a locked toolbox and a closed bureau. Maybe the passkey is in one of those? But the original instruction says it's on the floor of the bar. So perhaps the bar is a different room. The user hasn't encountered a bar yet. 

The user's current position is Scullery, and the directions suggest going east to the Studio, north to the Attic, or south back to Chamber. Since the original plan was to go east from the Chamber to the Laundromat, then west back, but maybe they need to find the bar. 

Alternatively, maybe the bar is in the Studio. The user is in the Scullery, and the next step is to go east to the Studio. But in the Studio, there's a locked toolbox and a closed bureau. Maybe the passkey is in the toolbox or bureau? But the original instruction says it's on the floor of the bar. So perhaps the bar is a room they haven't visited yet. 

Wait, the initial instruction said to go south, then west, then south, then east, then east again. The user has done that, but maybe they need to check the rooms they've passed. The Chamber had a sandwich on the floor. The Laundromat has a bench. The Scullery has a fridge. The Attic has a trunk. The Studio has a toolbox and bureau. The Cookhouse has a closed chest. 

Hmm, maybe the passkey is in the closed chest in the Cookhouse? But the user hasn't been back there. The user is currently in the Scullery, so maybe they need to go back north to the Attic, then east to the Studio, then north to the Studio's north exit, but that's unblocked. Wait, the Studio's north exit is unblocked. But the user hasn't checked that. 

Alternatively, maybe the bar is in the Chamber. The Chamber had a sandwich on the floor. But the passkey is supposed to be in the bar. Maybe the user needs to find the bar room. Since the user is in the Scullery, the next step is to go east to the Studio, then maybe north to the Studio's north exit, but that's unblocked. Wait, the Studio's north exit is unblocked. But the user hasn't checked that. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go from the Scullery north to the Attic, then east to the Studio, then north again. But the user is stuck in a loop. The user needs to find the bar. Since the original plan was to go east from the Chamber, which is in the Laundromat, but the user is back in the Scullery. 

Wait, maybe the user needs to go from the Scullery east to the Studio, then check the toolbox or bureau for the passkey. But the original instruction says the passkey is on the floor of the bar. So maybe the user needs to find the bar. 

Alternatively, maybe the bar is in the Studio. The user is in the Scullery, so going east to the Studio. In the Studio, there's a locked toolbox. Maybe the passkey is in the toolbox? But the user needs to unlock it. However, the user hasn't been told how to unlock it. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go back to the Cookhouse, where there's a closed chest. Maybe the passkey is there. But the user hasn't been there. 

This is confusing. The user's path seems to be going in circles. The original plan was to go south, west, south, east, east, then pick up the passkey. But the user is in the Scullery again. Maybe they need to go north to the Attic, then east to the Studio, then north to the Studio's north exit, but that's unblocked. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go from the Scullery east to the Studio, then check the closed bureau. But the user hasn't done that yet. 

Wait, the user's last action was going north from Scullery to Attic, then south back to Scullery. Now they're in Scullery again. The next step is to go east to the Studio. Then check the toolbox or bureau. But the passkey is supposed to be in the bar. 

Maybe the user needs to find the bar. Since the user hasn't encountered it yet, perhaps the bar is in the Studio. The user is in the Scullery, so going east to the Studio. Then check the toolbox or bureau. If the passkey is there, they can pick it up. But the original instruction says it's on the floor of the bar. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go from the Studio north to the next room, which might be the bar. But the Studio's north exit is unblocked. 

This is tricky. The user is following the original path but hasn't found the passkey. The next step would be to go east from the Scullery to the Studio, then check the toolbox or bureau. If that doesn't work, maybe the bar is in another room. 

But according to the initial instructions, the user should have gone east from the Chamber to the Laundromat, then west back, then east again. But the user is in the Scullery now. Maybe the bar is in the Studio. The user needs to check the Studio's toolbox or bureau for the passkey. 

So the next action would be to go east from Scullery to Studio, then check the toolbox or bureau. But the user hasn't done that yet. The user's last action was go north from Scullery to Attic, then south back. Now, the next step is to go east to Studio.

You find yourself in a studio. A typical one. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You make out a locked toolbox nearby. You can make out an opened bureau. The bureau is empty! What a waste of a day!

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the south. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in the Studio room with a locked toolbox and a bureau. They tried using the key on the toolbox but got an error. The key was found in the bureau earlier, but the toolbox is welded shut. The user might need to find another way to open the toolbox. Maybe the key isn't the right tool here, or perhaps there's another method. Since the toolbox is welded, maybe they need to use the key on a different object. Alternatively, maybe the key is for the bureau, but the bureau is already open. Wait, the user opened the bureau but it was empty. The key was in the bureau, but the toolbox is locked. Maybe the key is for the toolbox, but the user isn't using the correct command. The error message says "That's not a verb I recognise," so maybe the correct command is "unlock" instead of "use key on." Or perhaps "open" the toolbox with the key. But the toolbox is welded, so maybe "weld" is the verb? But that's not standard. Alternatively, maybe the key is for the bureau, but the bureau is already open. The user needs to figure out the correct action. Since the previous attempts to use the key on the toolbox failed, maybe the next step is to try a different command, like "unlock toolbox" or "open toolbox." But the user has to follow the correct syntax. The correct command might be "use key on toolbox," but the system says it's not recognized. Maybe the key is already in the inventory, so the user just needs to "open toolbox." Alternatively, the user might need to "try key on toolbox." But the system is strict with verbs. The user might need to try "unlock toolbox" or "open toolbox" without mentioning the key. But the key is in the bureau, so maybe the correct action is to use the key on the toolbox. However, the system is not recognizing it. Maybe the user needs to try a different approach, like looking for another way to open the toolbox. But the user is stuck here. The original goal was to pick up the passkey from the bar's floor, but the user hasn't found the bar yet. Maybe the bar is in another room, and the user needs to find it. But the current path is in the Studio. The user might need to go north, south, or west from the Studio. The next action could be to go north to the next room, hoping to find the bar. Alternatively, maybe the key is for the bureau, but the bureau is already open. The user is confused, but the correct next step might be to try "open toolbox" again, assuming the key is already in hand. But the system says "That's not a verb I recognise," so maybe the correct command is "unlock toolbox." But the user has to follow the exact syntax. The user might need to try "unlock toolbox" or "open toolbox" without the key. But the key is in the bureau. This is a bit of a dead end. The user needs to proceed to the next room to find the bar. So the next action would be to go north from the Studio.

Okay, the user is stuck in the Studio room again, trying to use the key on the toolbox. The system keeps saying "That's not a verb I recognise." So, maybe the correct command isn't "use key on toolbox" but something else. Let me think about possible commands in TextWorld.

Earlier, the user found a key in the bureau. The toolbox is locked, so maybe the key is for the toolbox. But the correct verb might be "unlock" instead of "use". Or perhaps "open" the toolbox with the key. But the system is strict with syntax. Maybe the key is already in the inventory, so the user just needs to "open toolbox". Alternatively, the user might need to "try key on toolbox" or "unlock toolbox". But the system doesn't recognize "use key on" as a valid command. Maybe the correct command is "unlock toolbox" without mentioning the key. Or maybe the key is for the bureau, but the bureau is already open. The user needs to figure out the right action. Since the previous attempts failed, maybe the next step is to try "open toolbox" or "unlock toolbox". Let's try "unlock toolbox".

Okay, the user is stuck in the Studio room with a locked toolbox that's welded shut. They've tried using the key on the toolbox multiple times, but it's not working. The key was found in the bureau, but the toolbox is locked and welded. The user is going in circles, trying different commands like "use key on toolbox" and "unlock toolbox", but the system isn't recognizing them. Maybe the key isn't the right tool here. Alternatively, maybe the toolbox needs to be opened another way. Since the toolbox is welded, perhaps the user needs to find a different method to open it, like using a tool or finding another key. But the user only has the key from the bureau. Alternatively, maybe the key is for the bureau, but the bureau is already open. The user might need to check other rooms for clues or find another way to proceed. The original goal was to pick up the passkey from the bar's floor, but the user hasn't found the bar yet. Maybe the bar is in a different room, and the user needs to explore more. However, the current path is stuck in the Studio. The next step might be to try a different command, like "look around" again to see if there's something else. But the user has already done that. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go back to the Cookhouse and check the closed chest. The closed chest might have the passkey. So the next action could be to go back to the Cookhouse and open the chest. Let's try that.

Okay, the user is stuck again trying to use the key on the toolbox. The system keeps saying "That's not a verb I recognise." So, maybe the correct command isn't "use key on toolbox" but something else. Let me think about possible commands in TextWorld.

Earlier, the user found a key in the bureau. The toolbox is locked, so maybe the key is for the toolbox. But the correct verb might be "unlock" instead of "use". Or perhaps "open" the toolbox with the key. But the system is strict with syntax. Maybe the key is already in the inventory, so the user just needs to "open toolbox". Alternatively, the user might need to "try key on toolbox" or "unlock toolbox". But the system doesn't recognize "use key on" as a valid command. Maybe the correct command is "unlock toolbox" without mentioning the key. Or maybe the key is for the bureau, but the bureau is already open. The user needs to figure out the right action. Since the previous attempts failed, maybe the next step is to try "open toolbox" or "unlock toolbox". Let's try "unlock toolbox".

-= Studio =-
You find yourself in a studio. A typical one. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You make out a locked toolbox nearby. You can make out an opened bureau. The bureau is empty! What a waste of a day!

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the south. There is an unblocked exit to the west.
