Welcome to TextWorld! First, it would be a great idea if you could head south. After that, travel east. Then, make an effort to move east. That done, head north. Then, pick up the Comic Strip Calendar from the floor of the workshop. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Bedroom =-
You find yourself in a bedroom. An ordinary one. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You can make out a dresser. The dresser is empty! What a waste of a day! You see a desk. The desk is standard. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a shelf. The shelf is typical. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

There is an open gate leading north. There is an open door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game and has been moving through different rooms: bedroom, cookhouse, office, and now cookery. The goal is to pick up the Comic Strip Calendar from the workshop.

So far, the user has gone south from the bedroom to the cookhouse, then east to the office, then east again to the cookery. The current room is cookery, which has exits to the north and west. The original instructions said after going east from the office, they should head north, then pick up the calendar.

Wait, the user is in the cookery room now. The next step according to the initial directions was to head north from the office, but maybe the path requires moving north from cookery. But the user needs to reach the workshop where the calendar is. The cookery's north exit might lead to the workshop. So the next action should be to go north. Then, once in the workshop, pick up the calendar. Let me check the previous steps again.

Original path: bedroom -> cookhouse -> office -> cookery. The next step was supposed to be north from the office, but the user went east again. Wait, maybe there's a confusion in the directions. The user might have taken the wrong path. Let me retrace.

Original instructions: After going south from bedroom, then east to cookhouse, then east again to office, then north. But the user is now in cookery. Maybe the correct path is from office to north, but the user went east again. Hmm, perhaps the user is taking a wrong turn. But according to the current room, cookery has a north exit. So maybe going north from cookery is the right move towards the workshop. Then, once in the workshop, pick up the calendar. So the next action should be go north.
</think>go north

-= Workshop =-
You've entered a workshop.

Were you looking for a toolbox? Because look over there, it's a toolbox.

There is an unguarded exit to the north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

There is a Comic Strip Calendar on the floor.
