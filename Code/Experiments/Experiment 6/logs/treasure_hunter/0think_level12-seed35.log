Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First, it would be fantastic if you could take a trip east. Then, attempt to go east. If you can manage that, recover the apple from the floor of the canteen. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Restroom =-
You are in a restroom. A normal kind of place. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."

An open dresser is here. What a letdown! The dresser is empty! You can make out a shelf. However, the shelf, like an empty shelf, has nothing on it. Sometimes, just sometimes, TextWorld can just be the worst.

There is an unblocked exit to the east.

AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go east
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Kitchen =-
You've entered a kitchen.

You see a rack. The rack is ordinary. But the thing is empty. You move on, clearly done caring about your TextWorld experience.

There is an open passageway leading south. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go east

-= Canteen =-
You find yourself in a canteen. An ordinary one.

You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a saucepan. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You move on, clearly done caring about your TextWorld experience.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

There is an apple and a passkey on the floor.
