Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First off, go north. With that over with, attempt to move north. If you can accomplish that, go to the west. With that over with, move west. Then, move south. Okay, and then, travel east. With that over with, make an effort to move south. Then, attempt to take a trip west. If you can accomplish that, lift the key from the floor of the chamber. That's it!

-= Canteen =-
I never took you for the sort of person who would show up in a canteen, but I guess I was wrong.

You can see a shelf. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unblocked exit to the west.
