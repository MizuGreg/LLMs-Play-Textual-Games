Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an profound round of TextWorld? You do! Here is your task for today. First, it would be a great idea if you could doublecheck that the gateway inside the workshop is ajar. And then, travel west. After that, pick up the stick of butter from the floor of the kitchen. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Workshop =-
You find yourself in a workshop. An ordinary kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

An open box is nearby. What a letdown! The box is empty!

There is a closed gateway leading west. There is an open hatch leading east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.
