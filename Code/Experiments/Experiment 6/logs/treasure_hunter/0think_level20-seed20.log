Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First step, move east. With that over with, ensure that the hatch is open. Once you have opened the hatch, make an attempt to take a trip east. And then, go east. And then, ensure that the gate is open. And then, travel north. That done, make an attempt to go west. Then, venture north. Next, head north. Then, pick-up the loaf of bread from the floor of the launderette. That's it!

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east.
