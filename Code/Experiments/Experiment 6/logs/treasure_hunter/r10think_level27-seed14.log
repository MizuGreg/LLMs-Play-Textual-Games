Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! First of all, you could, like, make an effort to venture west. Okay, and then, try to travel west. With that over with, ensure that the door is open. After that, make an attempt to take a trip north. And then, try to go east. With that over with, travel north. With that accomplished, head north. With that over with, travel east. Then, attempt to venture north. With that over with, try to travel east. Okay, and then, try to go to the south. If you can manage that, make an attempt to take a trip south. That done, move south. That done, lift the mop from the floor of the laundry place. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Parlor =-
You find yourself in a parlor. An ordinary one.

Oh, great. Here's a basket. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You can see a portmanteau. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a safe. What a great pairing of adjectives and nouns! You can see a locker. The locker is empty, what a horrible day!

You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text adventure game called TextWorld. They've been moving around different rooms like the Parlor, Canteen, Workshop, Chamber, Study, Dish-Pit, and now the Pantry. The goal mentioned earlier was to pick up items and put them in places, eventually stopping once done. 

Looking at the current room, the Pantry, there's a closed door leading south, an open stone passageway east, and an open cedar portal west. The user is at the Pantry now. The previous actions involved moving west and east between rooms, trying to find unguarded exits and navigate through the maze of rooms.

The user is asking if they're making the right actions and if they're close to the goal. The original goal was to pick up stuff and put it in places. So far, they've been moving around, but haven't picked up any items. In the Study, there was a bookshelf that was empty and a chair, but nothing to pick up. In the Dish-Pit, there was a fridge and a locked case. In the Pantry, there's a stand they fell onto, but it's empty.

So, maybe the next step is to check the locked case in the Dish-Pit or the locked trunk in the Chamber. But the user is currently in the Pantry. The available exits are south, east, and west. The south leads back to the Study, east is a stone passageway, and west is the cedar portal. The user might need to check the locked case in the Dish-Pit, but to get there, they need to go south from the Pantry to the Dish-Pit. However, the user is at the Pantry now, so the next logical step would be to go south to the Dish-Pit, check the locked case, maybe try to open it. Alternatively, go east or west to other areas.

But the user's previous actions have been moving west and east, so maybe they need to check the locked trunk in the Chamber. However, the Chamber's trunk is locked. The user might need a key or some way to open it. Alternatively, maybe there's an item in the Pantry that they can pick up. The stand they fell onto is empty, so maybe nothing there.

The user is asking if they're close to the goal. Since they haven't picked up any items yet, maybe they need to explore more rooms, find items, and then carry them to other places. The next action should be to check the locked case in the Dish-Pit by going south. So the next command would be "go south" to reach the Dish-Pit and then try to open the locked case.

Okay, the user is stuck in the Pantry, trying to go south but the door is locked. They've tried going south multiple times, but each time it says they need to open the door first. The original goal was to pick up items and put them in places. So far, they haven't found any items. Maybe they need to find a key or figure out how to open the locked door.

Looking at the current room, the Pantry, there's a closed door south, an open stone passageway east, and an open cedar portal west. The user has been trying to go south, but it's blocked. Perhaps they need to check other directions first. The east and west exits might lead to other rooms with items or keys. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to open the locked door in the Pantry by using an item from another room.

The user might need to explore the east or west exits instead of continuing to try to go south. The east is a stone passageway, and west is a cedar portal. Maybe those lead to rooms with items or a key. The user should try moving east or west to find a way to open the locked door in the Pantry. The next action should be to go east or west instead of continuing to attempt south.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Pantry and Dish-Pit, trying to open the door south in the Pantry. They've been going back and forth between these rooms multiple times. The original goal was to pick up items and put them in places. So far, they haven't found any items. The locked case in the Dish-Pit might be a clue. Maybe they need to find a key or figure out how to open it. The user has been trying to go south from the Pantry but can't because the door is locked. They need to find a way to open it. Maybe there's a key in the Study or another room. The user should check the Study's bookshelf or chair for anything. Alternatively, maybe the locked trunk in the Chamber has a key. But they haven't been there yet. The next step is to check the Study for items. The user should go east from the Study to the Pantry again, but that's where they started. Alternatively, go north from the Study to the Dish-Pit and try to open the locked case. Maybe that's the way to get a key. So the next action should be to go north from the Study to the Dish-Pit and try to open the case.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Study and Dish-Pit. They've tried going north, east, west, and south but can't move anywhere. The original goal was to pick up items and put them in places. So far, they haven't found any items. The locked case in the Dish-Pit and the locked trunk in the Chamber are the only items mentioned. Maybe they need to find a key or figure out how to open the locked doors.

The user is in the Study now. The Study has a bookshelf that's empty and a chair. The only exits are east (cedar portal) and south. They tried going south to the Dish-Pit, but can't go north from there. Maybe they need to check the Study's bookshelf or chair for something. But the description says they're empty. Alternatively, maybe the key is in the Pantry or another room. But the Pantry's door is locked. The user might need to find a way to open the locked doors by using items from other rooms. Since they haven't found any items yet, maybe they need to explore more. The next step could be to go east from the Study to the Pantry again, but that's where they started. Alternatively, try to find another way to open the locked doors. But since they can't move north from the Dish-Pit, maybe they need to find a different approach. The user might be stuck in a loop and needs to find a different path or item to proceed.

-= Study =-
You are in a study. A normal kind of place.

You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a bookshelf. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You see a chair. But the thing is empty.

There is an open cedar portal leading east. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Study and Pantry, trying to open the locked door south in the Pantry. They've tried going back and forth multiple times without success. The original goal was to pick up items and put them in places, but so far, no items have been found. The locked case in the Dish-Pit and the locked trunk in the Chamber are the only items mentioned. Maybe the key is in the Study's bookshelf or chair, but the descriptions say they're empty. The user needs to find a way to open the locked doors. Since they can't go north from the Dish-Pit, maybe they need to find another approach. The next step might be to check the Study's bookshelf again or look for a key in the Pantry. But since the Pantry's door is locked, they need to find a way to open it. Maybe the answer is to look for a key in the Study or another room and use it to open the door. However, the user hasn't found any keys yet. The next action should be to check the Study's bookshelf again or try to find a key in the Pantry.

You find yourself in a pantry. An usual one.

You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stand. But the thing is empty.
