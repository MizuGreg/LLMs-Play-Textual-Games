-= Cookery =-
Look at you, bigshot, walking into a cookery like it isn't some huge deal. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

You scan the room for a chest, and you find a chest. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a pan. But there isn't a thing on it.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place. The room is well lit.

You smell a terrible smell, and follow it to a refrigerator. You wonder idly who left that here. You can see a rack. The rack is normal. But there isn't a thing on it.

You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.
