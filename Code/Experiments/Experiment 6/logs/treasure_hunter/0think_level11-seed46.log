You are now playing a life changing session of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, you could, like, move west. With that over with, pick up the key from the floor of the chamber. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Salon =-
You've entered a salon.

You smell a terrible smell, and follow it to a box. What a letdown! The box is empty! You see a locked portmanteau.

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Chamber =-
You are in a chamber. An usual one. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You can see a dresser. The dresser is empty, what a horrible day!

There is an unblocked exit to the east.

There is a key on the floor.
