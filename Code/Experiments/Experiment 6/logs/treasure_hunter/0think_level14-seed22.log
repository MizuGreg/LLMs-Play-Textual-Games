You are now playing a life changing session of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to make an effort to venture east. And then, go to the north. And then, make an effort to move east. And then, attempt to travel north. With that accomplished, lift the key from the floor of the studio. And if you do that, you're the winner!
