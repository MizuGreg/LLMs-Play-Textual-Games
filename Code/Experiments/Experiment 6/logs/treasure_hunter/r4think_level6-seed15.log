You are now playing a exciting game of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First, it would be great if you could go west. After that, attempt to head north. And then, lift the banana from the floor of the workshop. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Canteen =-
You find yourself in a canteen. A normal kind of place. You start to take note of what's in the room.



There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is playing a text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and perform specific actions. The goal is to lift the banana in the workshop.

First, the user started in the canteen, went west to the kitchenette, then north to the workshop. In the workshop, there's a banana on the floor. The user tried "lift banana" but got an error. The correct command should be "lift the banana" as the game might require the article "the".

The user is asking if they're on the right track. They've followed the hints: go west, then north, and now they need to lift the banana. The error suggests that the command format is important. The correct verb is "lift", followed by "the banana" to specify the object. So the next action should be "lift the banana" again, making sure to include "the".

The user might be confused because the game didn't accept "lift banana" before. The correct syntax includes the article. So the next step is to try that command again.

Okay, the user is stuck in the Workshop room, trying to lift the banana. They've tried "lift the banana" multiple times, but the game keeps saying it's not a recognized verb. Let me think about possible issues here.

First, maybe the correct command is different. In text adventures, sometimes you have to use specific verbs. Instead of "lift", maybe "take" or "pick up" is the right verb. But the user was told to "lift the banana", so perhaps the game expects "lift".

Wait, the user's previous attempts all ended with the same error. Maybe the game is case-sensitive? Like "Lift the banana" with a capital L? But the user has been using lowercase. Alternatively, maybe the banana isn't considered a valid object here, or maybe it's not in the right location.

Looking back at the environment descriptions: The Workshop has a banana on the floor. The user is in the Workshop, so the banana should be accessible. The error message says "That's not a verb I recognise," which suggests that the command structure is wrong. Maybe the correct syntax is "lift banana" without "the", but the game expects "the".

Alternatively, maybe the game uses a different verb. For example, "take the banana" instead of "lift". But the original instruction said to "lift the banana". Hmm.

Wait, the user's previous attempts were "lift banana" and "lift the banana". The game didn't accept "lift banana" because "banana" isn't a verb. But "lift" is the verb, and "the banana" is the object. So the correct command should be "lift the banana". But the game is rejecting it. Maybe there's a typo in the object name. Is the banana actually called "banana" or something else? The description says "a banana on the floor", so "banana" is correct.

Alternatively, maybe the game requires using "pick up" instead of "lift". Let me check the possible verbs. In many text games, "take" or "pick up" are common. But the user was instructed to "lift", so maybe that's the correct verb here.

Wait, the user is in the Workshop, and the banana is on the floor. Maybe the correct command is "pick up the banana". But the user was told to "lift", so perhaps the game expects "lift".

But the game is not accepting "lift the banana". Maybe the game is case-sensitive, so "Lift the banana"? Or maybe the banana is not in the correct location. Wait, the user is in the Workshop, and the banana is there. So that's not the issue.

Alternatively, maybe the game requires using "get" instead of "lift". But the user was told to "lift".

This is confusing. The user has tried multiple times, and the game keeps rejecting the command. Maybe the correct answer is "take the banana", but the user was instructed to "lift". Alternatively, maybe the game is expecting a different verb.

But the user's original task was to "lift the banana from the floor of the workshop". So the correct command should be "lift the banana". But the game is not accepting it. Maybe there's a mistake in the game's code, but the user has to follow the instructions.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use "get" instead of "lift". Let me think. In some games, "get" is the verb for picking up items. So maybe the correct command is "get the banana".

But the user was told to "lift", so perhaps that's the correct verb. However, the game is not recognizing it. Maybe the user should try "take the banana" as a different approach.

But the user's previous attempts were "lift banana" and "lift the banana". The game says "That's not a verb I recognise." So maybe the problem is that "lift" is not a valid verb here. Maybe the correct verb is "pick up".

Alternatively, maybe the banana is not considered a valid object. But the description says there is a banana on the floor. So it should be valid.

Hmm. The user is stuck. The correct action is to lift the banana, but the game is not accepting the command. Maybe the user needs to try a different verb. Let's try "take the banana" as the next step.
