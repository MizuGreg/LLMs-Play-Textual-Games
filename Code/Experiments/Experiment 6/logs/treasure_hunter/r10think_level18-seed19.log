Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. Your first objective is to make an effort to go to the north. Okay, and then, try to venture west. Once you get through with that, pick up the latchkey from the floor of the kitchen. That's it!

-= Cubicle =-
You are in a cubicle. An ordinary one.

Were you looking for a toolbox? Because look over there, it's a toolbox. The toolbox is empty, what a horrible day!

There is a closed portal leading east. There is an open hatch leading north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go north

-= Closet =-
You've entered a closet.

You see an opened chest. What a letdown! The chest is empty!

There is an open hatch leading south. There is an open gateway leading west.

AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go west
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Kitchen =-
You're now in the kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You smell a sickening smell, and follow it to a freezer. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You make out a closed case, which looks normal, in the corner. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a table. The table is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open gateway leading east. There is an open passageway leading north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

There is a latchkey on the floor.

AGENT -------------------------------------------------
pick up latchkey
