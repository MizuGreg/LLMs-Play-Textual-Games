Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to make an attempt to venture south. And then, go west. With that accomplished, make an effort to go to the south. Then, lift the keycard from the floor of the laundry place. Alright, thanks!

-= Canteen =-
You've just sauntered into a canteen. Let's see what's in here.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. There is an unguarded exit to the south.
