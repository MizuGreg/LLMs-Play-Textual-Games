And then, unlock the type A door. Then, open the type A door. And then, go to the south. With that over with, try to venture west. If you can do that, try to travel west. Then, attempt to venture south. And then, try to travel east. Following that, go to the east. Next, try to go to the east. With that accomplished, make an attempt to take a trip south. Okay, and then, go to the south. Following that, head west. And then, lift the printer from the floor of the austere workshop. And once you've done that, you win!
