Welcome to another life changing game of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First, it would be a great idea if you could move west. If you can manage that, make an attempt to go south. Then, pick-up the passkey from the floor of the cubicle. Got that? Good!

-= Garage =-
You have stumbled into the most usual of all possible garages. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.



There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

-= Basement =-
You find yourself in a basement. An ordinary kind of place. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

-= Cubicle =-
I am sorry to announce that you are now in the cubicle.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north.

There is a passkey and a key on the floor.
