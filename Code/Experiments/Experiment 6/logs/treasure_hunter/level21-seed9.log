It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! First of all, travel west. And then, make an attempt to venture west. That done, recover the paper towel from the safe. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Basement =-
You find yourself in a basement. A typical one.

You can see a cabinet. You make out a workbench. The workbench is typical. However, the workbench, like an empty workbench, has nothing on it.

There is an unguarded exit to the east. There is an unguarded exit to the south. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

-= Bedchamber =-
You've just sauntered into a bedchamber.



There is an unblocked exit to the east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game called TextWorld. The goal is to recover the paper towel from the safe and then win. So far, they've moved west from the basement into the bedchamber. The current location is the bedchamber, and the exits are east, north, and west. The user is asking if they're making the right moves and if they're close to the goal.

First, I need to recall the previous steps. The user started in the basement, went west to the bedchamber. The next step is to figure out what's needed. The original instructions said to go west, then venture west again, then recover the paper towel from the safe. But in the current location, the bedchamber, the exits are east, north, and west. The user is at the bedchamber, and the next action should be to go west again, as per the initial instruction. But wait, the bedchamber's description mentions that there's an unblocked exit to the east, and the user is told to try going north or west. The user is in the bedchamber, and the next step would be to go west again to continue exploring. However, the user is asking if they're on the right track. 

The original plan was to go west, then venture west again. So after the first west to the bedchamber, the next step would be to go west again. But in the bedchamber, the exits are east, north, and west. So going west from the bedchamber would take them to another room. The user is at the bedchamber, so the next action should be to go west again. But the user is asking if they're close to the goal. Since the paper towel is in the safe, they need to find the safe. The safe might be in a different room. So the user needs to explore further. 

But the user's next action should be to go west again. The bedchamber's west exit is unblocked, so that's the next step. Then, after moving west, they might find the safe or the paper towel. Alternatively, maybe the safe is in the north or east direction. But according to the initial instructions, after going west, they need to venture west again. So the user should go west again from the bedchamber. Therefore, the next command is "go west".

-= Sauna =-
You've just sauntered into a sauna.

You make out an opened normal looking safe in the room. The safe contains a paper towel. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting.

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. There is an unblocked exit to the north.



>                                                                                                                                -= Sauna =-0/3

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game where they have to navigate through different rooms and find a paper towel in a safe to win. So far, they've gone from the basement to the bedchamber and then to the sauna. In the sauna, there's an opened safe with a paper towel inside.

The original goal was to recover the paper towel from the safe and then win. The user is now in the sauna, and they need to get the paper towel. Since the safe is already opened and the paper towel is inside, the next logical step is to take the paper towel. But in text adventures, usually, you can't just take items unless there's a specific command like "take" or "get". However, the user's previous actions were just moving around, so maybe the game expects them to pick it up.

Wait, the user's last action was moving west into the sauna. Now, in the sauna, the safe is described as opened and containing the paper towel. The user needs to retrieve it. The next step would be to take the paper towel. But the user's instruction says to only output the action, like "go north". So the correct command here would be "take paper towel" or "get paper towel". But I need to check if the game allows that. Since the safe is opened, maybe the user can just take the paper towel from the safe.

Alternatively, maybe the game requires the user to open the safe first, but the description says the safe is already opened. So the correct action is to take the paper towel. Therefore, the next command should be "take paper towel" to retrieve it and then win.
