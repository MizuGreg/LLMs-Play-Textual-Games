Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game and has been moving around different rooms. The goal is to recover the paper towel from the safe in the sauna and then win. So far, they've gone from the basement west to the bedchamber, then north to the spare room, west to the canteen, south to the sauna, and then east back to the bedchamber.

In the sauna, they found the safe with the paper towel. The next step would be to take the paper towel. But the safe is described as "opened normal looking," so maybe it's already accessible. The user needs to pick up the paper towel from the safe. Since the safe is in the sauna, and they're currently in the bedchamber, they need to go back to the sauna. But the last move was east to the bedchamber, so they need to go west back to the sauna. Once there, they can take the paper towel. Then, after taking it, they would win. So the next action should be to go west from the bedchamber back to the sauna, then take the paper towel. But the user's last action was going east to the bedchamber, so the next step is to go west again to return to the sauna where the paper towel is. Then take it. But the user's next command should be "go west" to get back to the sauna.
