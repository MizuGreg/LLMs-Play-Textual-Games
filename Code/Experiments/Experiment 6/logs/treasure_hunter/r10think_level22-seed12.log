Welcome to another exciting episode of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to travel east. That done, make an effort to go south. And then, attempt to move south. And then, make an attempt to travel west. Okay, and then, pick up the desktop computer from the floor of the austere workshop. Got that? Good!

-= Cookhouse =-
Well, here we are in the cookhouse.

What's that over there? It looks like it's a board. The board is normal. The board appears to be empty. You think about smashing the board to bits, throwing the bits into a pit, etc, until you get bored.

There is an open passageway leading east. There is an open portal leading north. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

There is a desktop computer on the floor.
