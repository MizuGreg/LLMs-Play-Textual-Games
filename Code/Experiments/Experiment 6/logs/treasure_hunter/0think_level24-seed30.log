Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to make an attempt to go to the south. Next, attempt to go to the east. And then, take a trip north. After that, venture east. After that, attempt to venture north. With that accomplished, try to go north. And then, venture west. And then, make an effort to move west. And then, retrieve the key from the rack. That's it!

-= Restroom =-
I never took you for the sort of person who would show up in a restroom, but I guess I was wrong.

You can see a counter. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You swear loudly.

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the west.
