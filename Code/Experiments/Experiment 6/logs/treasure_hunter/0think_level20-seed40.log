You are now playing a life changing round of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First, it would be good if you could venture north. Then, travel west. And then, go to the south. Once you get around to doing that, move south. Next, open the hatch. And then, make an attempt to head east. Okay, and then, make an effort to move east. After that, open the door. Then, attempt to go to the south. And then, retrieve the candy bar from the board in the kitchen. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Salon =-
You arrive in a salon. A standard one.



There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded.
