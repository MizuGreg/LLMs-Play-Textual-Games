Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an fast paced round of TextWorld? You do! Here is how to play! First step, go to the north. With that over with, make an attempt to take a trip north. And then, make an attempt to travel east. Then, travel south. After that, take a trip east. Then, make an effort to go to the south. With that accomplished, make an attempt to go west. If you can get through with that, recover the worm from the floor of the kitchenette. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Shower =-
You are in a shower. A typical kind of place.

You can see a closed dresser in the room. You can make out a basket. You can see a bench. The bench is ordinary. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a rack. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The rack is typical. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

You are in a basement. An ordinary one. You begin to take stock of what's here.

Oh, great. Here's a workbench. The workbench appears to be empty. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this TextWorld game, and they've been given a series of directions. The initial instruction was to go north, then east, south, east again, south, west, recover the worm from the kitchenette, and win.

So far, the user started in the shower, went north to the basement. The current location is the basement. The next steps according to the original instructions are: after going north, then east, then south, then east again, then south, then west. But the user has only done the first move (north from shower to basement). The next step in the original plan was to go east from the basement. But the user is asking if they're on the right track and what their next action should be.

Looking at the basement description, there's an exit to the east, north, and south. The user's next move should be east, as per the original plan. The user might be confused if they're not sure if they're following the correct path. The assistant needs to confirm that going east is the next correct action. The user's question is about whether they're close to the goal, but based on the instructions, the next step is indeed east. So the correct command is "go east".

-= Bedroom =-
You're now in a bedroom. You begin looking for stuff.

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a box. You shudder, but continue examining the room.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the north. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and eventually recover the worm from the kitchenette. The initial instructions mentioned going north, then east, south, east again, south, and west. Then recover the worm and win.

So far, the user has gone from the shower to the basement, then to the bedroom. The current room is the bedroom. The next step in the original plan was to go south after traveling east again. But in the current room, the available exits are north and west. The user is supposed to go south next, but maybe that's not directly possible here. Wait, the original plan said after going east again (probably from the basement?), then go south. But in the bedroom, the exits are north and west. Maybe the user needs to go west first? Or perhaps there's a different path.

Wait, the user's current location is the bedroom. The original plan was after going east (from basement?), then south. But in the bedroom, the exits are north and west. So maybe the user needs to go west to the basement again, then north to the shower? But that seems like going back. Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go north from the bedroom. But the original plan said after going east, then south. Maybe the user is a bit confused here.

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go west from the bedroom to the basement, then north to the shower, then east to the basement again? But that doesn't seem to align with the original plan. The original plan was to go north, east, south, east, south, west. So after the bedroom, maybe the next step is to go west? But the user is in the bedroom, and the available exits are north and west. So the next action should be west? But the original plan said after going east, go south. Maybe the user is at the bedroom, and needs to go west to the basement, then north to the shower, then east to the basement again? But that's not clear.

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go north from the bedroom. But the original plan didn't mention that. The original plan was to go north, east, south, east, south, west.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game where they have to navigate through different rooms and eventually recover a worm from the kitchenette. The current room is the basement again, and they've been moving around between the shower, basement, and bedroom.

The user's goal is to go north, then east, south, east again, south, and west, then get the worm from the kitchenette. So far, they've gone north from the shower to the basement, then east to the bedroom, then west back to the basement. Now, they're in the basement again. The next step according to the initial instructions was to go south from the bedroom, but after moving west, they're back in the basement. 

Looking at the current room description, the basement has exits to the north, east, and south. The user needs to continue following the path: after the basement, they should go south to maybe the kitchenette? But the initial plan was to go south from the bedroom, then east, then south again, then west. Wait, maybe the path is a loop, and they need to find the correct sequence.

Alternatively, maybe the kitchenette is in a different part. The user needs to recover the worm from the floor of the kitchenette. So perhaps the kitchenette is a room that's part of the basement or connected. But the current room is the basement. The user might need to go north from the basement to reach the kitchenette. But the initial steps mentioned going north, then east, then south, etc. Maybe the user is supposed to go north from the basement to reach the kitchenette. But the problem is that the user is stuck in the basement, moving between the same rooms.

Alternatively, maybe the correct path is to go east from the basement. The user is in the basement, and the next step should be east to proceed further. But the initial plan was to go south from the bedroom, then east. Wait, the user's previous steps were: shower -> basement -> bedroom -> basement. Now, they need to continue following the original plan. The original plan was after the basement, go south. But in the basement, the exits are north, east, south. So maybe the user should go south from the basement to reach the kitchenette. But the initial instruction said after going west, they need to recover the worm from the kitchenette. So perhaps the kitchenette is south of the basement. So the next step is to go south from the basement to reach the kitchenette, then take the worm. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action should be to go south from the basement.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and eventually recover the worm from the kitchenette. The goal is to follow a specific path: go north, then east, south, east again, south, then west, and finally get the worm.

So far, the user has moved through the Shower, Basement, Bedroom, and back to the Basement, then back to the Shower. The current room is the Shower again. The next step according to the initial instructions was to travel east again. But the user is now at the Shower, and the exits are east, north, and south. The next action in the sequence after the initial steps was to go east again. But the user might be getting confused because they're looping between rooms.

Wait, the original plan was after going west, then the next steps were to go south, then east, then south again, then west. But maybe the user is retracing their steps. However, the key is to find the kitchenette and recover the worm. The user hasn't mentioned the kitchenette yet, so maybe they need to proceed further.

In the current Shower room, the exits are east, north, and south. The user has already tried going north and south, and east. But perhaps the correct path is to go east again from the Shower. The initial instruction said after going west, go south, then east, then south, then west. But maybe the user needs to proceed east from the Shower to reach the next area. Alternatively, maybe the kitchenette is in a different direction. However, based on the initial directions, the user needs to follow the sequence: north, east, south, east, south, west. So after the west, the next step was to go south again. But in the current state, the user is in the Shower again. Maybe the next step is to go east again to proceed further. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go north from the Shower to reach the next room. But the initial plan was to go north first, then east, then south, etc. So perhaps the user is following the correct path, but needs to continue moving east from the Shower. However, the user is at the Shower, and the next step in the sequence after the initial steps was to go east again. So the next action should be go east.

A well framed board tells you that you are now in the kitchenette.

You smell a sickening smell, and follow it to a saucepan. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

There is a worm on the floor.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game, and their goal is to recover the worm from the floor of the kitchenette and then win. So far, they've been moving around different rooms: shower, basement, bedroom, back to shower, and now they're in the kitchenette.

In the kitchenette, the description mentions there's a worm on the floor. The previous steps mentioned trying to go east and west, and the user just arrived here. The next logical step would be to try and pick up the worm. Since the game's final goal is to recover the worm, the user needs to take it from the floor.

Looking at the available commands, the user has been moving between rooms, but now they're in the kitchenette. The prompt says "recover the worm from the floor of the kitchenette." So the correct action here is to take the worm. The user hasn't done that yet, so the next command should be "take worm" or something similar. But in the game's context, maybe the exact command is "take worm" or "get worm." Since the user is instructed to only output the action, the correct command here is "take worm."
