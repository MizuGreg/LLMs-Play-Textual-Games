It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! First, it would be great if you could try to head east. With that done, go east. With that over with, try to go south. With that over with, take a trip west. Okay, and then, pick-up the worm from the floor of the kitchenette. Alright, thanks!

-= Basement =-
You are in a basement. An ordinary one. You begin to take stock of what's here.

Oh, great. Here's a workbench. The workbench appears to be empty. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

-= Bedroom =-
You're now in a bedroom. You begin looking for stuff.

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a box. You shudder, but continue examining the room.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the north. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

-= Shower =-
You are in a shower. A typical kind of place.

You can see a closed dresser in the room. You can make out a basket. You can see a bench. The bench is ordinary. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a rack. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The rack is typical. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

-= Sauna =-
You have fallen into the most standard of all possible saunas.

You make out a board. The board is ordinary. However, the board, like an empty board, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this TextWorld game and has been moving around different rooms: basement, bedroom, shower, sauna, and back to the shower. The original goal mentioned in the initial prompt was to "pick-up the worm from the floor of the kitchenette." So far, the player hasn't found the worm yet.

Looking at the current location, which is the shower. The description mentions a closed dresser, a basket, a bench, a rack, but nothing on them. The exits are east, north, and south. The player has been moving east, west, south, north, and back. Maybe they need to check the dresser or basket for the worm? But the problem is that the game's environment might not have the worm in these rooms. The kitchenette wasn't visited yet. 

Wait, the initial instructions said to go east, then east again, then south, then west, and then pick up the worm from the kitchenette. But the player hasn't gone to the kitchenette yet. The current path has them in the shower. The exits from the shower are east, north, south. The north exit leads back to the shower, and the south exit would take them back to the sauna, then maybe to the shower again. Hmm, maybe the player needs to find the correct path to the kitchenette. 

Alternatively, maybe the worm is in the shower? But the description says there's nothing on the rack, bench, etc. The user might need to check the closed dresser. Maybe the worm is inside the dresser? But the dresser is closed. The player might need to open it. However, the game's commands might not include opening things unless specified. The initial prompt didn't mention any items to pick up except the worm in the kitchenette. 

Wait, the user's last action was going north from the sauna back to the shower. Now, in the shower, the exits are east, north, south. The player might need to go east from the shower to reach the kitchenette. But the initial directions said to go east, then east again, then south, then west. Maybe the kitchenette is in a different part. Alternatively, maybe the player is supposed to check the basket or dresser for the worm. But the game's environment doesn't mention the worm being there. 

The user is asking if they're making the right actions and if they're close to the goal. Since the original goal is the kitchenette's worm, and the player hasn't reached the kitchenette yet, they might be on the wrong path. The current location is the shower, so maybe they need to go east from the shower to reach the kitchenette. But the initial instructions said to go east, then east again, then south, then west. Maybe the player is going in circles. 

Alternatively, maybe the player needs to check the basket or dresser for the worm. But the game's description doesn't mention the worm in those places. The user might need to proceed to the kitchenette through the correct path. Since the initial directions said to go east, then east again, then south, then west, perhaps the kitchenette is in a different area. But the player is currently in the shower. Maybe the next step is to go east from the shower to reach the kitchenette. However, the game's current state doesn't mention the kitchenette being accessible from the shower. 

Alternatively, maybe the player is supposed to check the rack or bench for the worm, but the description says there's nothing on them. The user might be stuck in a loop. The next action should be to go east from the shower to check if that leads to the kitchenette. But the user is asking if they're close. Since they haven't found the worm yet, they might not be. The correct path might involve moving to the kitchenette through the basement or another room. But the player is in the shower now. Maybe the next step is to go east to check that area.

-= Kitchenette =-
A well framed board tells you that you are now in the kitchenette.

You smell a sickening smell, and follow it to a saucepan. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

There is a worm on the floor.
