Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to make an effort to move west. Once you manage that, take a trip west. After that, move south. Next, travel east. If you can get around to doing that, try to venture south. Then, venture south. Then, pick up the keycard from the floor of the bar. Got that? Good!

-= Restroom =-
You are in a restroom. It seems to be pretty ordinary here. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

You see a rack. The rack is usual. But the thing is empty. Hopefully, this discovery doesn't ruin your TextWorld experience!

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. There is an unblocked exit to the south. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

-= Scullery =-
You arrive in a scullery. An ordinary one. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a key on the floor.

-= Sauna =-
You're now in the sauna.

You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a board. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The board is usual. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You scan the room, seeing a chipped counter. You wonder idly who left that here. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

-= Canteen =-
You've entered a canteen.

You make out a locked fridge.

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

Of every bar you could have shown up in, you had to come round an ordinary one.

There is a keycard on the floor.
