Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, venture west. And then, lift the type 3 latchkey from the floor of the canteen. And then, venture east. After that, unlock the type 3 gateway within the cubicle with the type 3 latchkey. Then, make it so that the type 3 gateway is open. Then, make an attempt to go to the east. And then, make an effort to head east. With that over with, try to move south. With that accomplished, go west. Okay, and then, try to move south. Once you do that, move east. With that accomplished, take a trip east. Following that, try to venture north. Following that, retrieve the fondue from the floor of the shower. Alright, thanks!

You are in a cubicle. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.
