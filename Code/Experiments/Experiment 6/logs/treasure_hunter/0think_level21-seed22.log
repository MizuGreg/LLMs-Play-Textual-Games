Welcome to TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First off, attempt to go to the north. With that done, make an attempt to travel east. After that, retrieve the keycard from the floor of the bathroom. That's it!

-= Pantry =-
You're now in a pantry.



There is an unguarded exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

-= Chamber =-
Look at you, bigshot, walking into a chamber like it isn't some huge deal.

You make out a bar. The bar is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the bar. You can see a bed stand! The bed stand is ordinary. On the bed stand you see a textbook, so there's that.

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

-= Bathroom =-
You've just shown up in a bathroom.



You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

There is a keycard on the floor.
