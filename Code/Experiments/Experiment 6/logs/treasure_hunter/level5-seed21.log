It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First off, try to head west. Next, try to go to the north. With that accomplished, pick up the latchkey from the floor of the sauna. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go west

-= Canteen =-
You're now in the canteen. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north.

-= Sauna =-
I never took you for the sort of person who would show up in a sauna, but I guess I was wrong.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

There is a latchkey on the floor.
