Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, make an attempt to go east. And then, attempt to go to the east. If you can manage that, recover the hat from the floor of the closet. That's it!

-= Studio =-
Well, here we are in the studio.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

-= Dish-Pit =-
Welcome to the dish-pit.

You see a freezer. You wonder idly who left that here. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You see a chest. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You can make out an opened refrigerator right there by you. The refrigerator is empty! What a waste of a day! You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a fridge. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can make out a chair. The chair is normal. But the thing is empty.

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.
