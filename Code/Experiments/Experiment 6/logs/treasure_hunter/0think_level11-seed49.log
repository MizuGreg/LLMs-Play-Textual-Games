It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First step, take a trip west. With that done, recover the printer from the chair in the cubicle. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Workshop =-
You are in a workshop. A standard one.

You can see a cabinet. You see a case. You can make out a mantle! The mantle appears to be empty.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unblocked exit to the south. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

-= Cubicle =-
You are in a cubicle. An usual kind of place. Let's see what's in here.

You can see an opened safe. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You see a locked coffer. You can see a chair. You see a printer on the chair.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.
