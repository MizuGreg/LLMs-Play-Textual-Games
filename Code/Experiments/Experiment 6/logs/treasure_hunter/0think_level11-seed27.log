Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First thing I need you to do is to move west. Then, recover the shadfly from the floor of the spare room. That's it!

-= Kitchenette =-
You find yourself in a kitchenette. A standard one. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

An open cabinet is close by. The cabinet is empty, what a horrible day! Look over there! a pan. The pan is standard. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is an open hatch leading east. There is an open passageway leading west.

AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go west

-= Spare Room =-
You find yourself in a spare room. A standard kind of place. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You scan the room for a safe, and you find a safe. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now.

There is an open passageway leading east. There is an open door leading north.

There is a shadfly on the floor.
