You are now playing a exciting game of TextWorld! First thing I need you to do is to head east. Okay, and then, make an effort to head east. Then, go east. And then, head north. Then, make an effort to go west. And then, recover the keycard from the stand inside the attic. If you have picked up the keycard, make an effort to go to the east. If you can finish that, unlock the gateway within the studio. And then, ensure that the gateway is open. And then, attempt to head east. And then, try to travel south. If you can accomplish that, take the garlic clove from the fridge. Alright, thanks!

-= Workshop =-
You arrive in a workshop. A normal one. Let's see what's in here.

You can make out a locked usual looking toolbox in the corner. You make out a locker. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. The locker is empty! What a waste of a day! You can make out a mantle. The mantle is ordinary. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game and has been moving through different rooms: Workshop, Pantry, Bar, Salon, Washroom, and now Cookery. The original goal mentioned was to recover the keycard from the attic, unlock the gateway in the studio, and then proceed east and south, finally getting the garlic clove from the fridge.

So far, the user has been going east each time, which led them through various rooms. Now they're in the Cookery room. The directions here are east, north, and west. The user's next step would be to check if moving north or west makes sense. But the original plan was to go east after getting the keycard. However, the keycard was supposed to be in the attic, which hasn't been mentioned yet. Wait, the user's initial instructions included going to the attic to get the keycard. But so far, they haven't encountered the attic. Maybe they need to go north from the Cookery room to reach the attic?

Looking at the current room description: "You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. There is an unguarded exit to the west." So moving north or west is possible. The user's previous actions were all east, but now they need to head north to reach the attic. The original plan was to go east after getting the keycard, but if the keycard is in the attic, then the user needs to get there first. So the next logical step would be to go north to reach the attic. That makes sense because the attic is likely north of the Cookery room. Let me check the previous rooms. The user went east from Workshop to Pantry, then Bar, Salon, Washroom, Cookery. Each time, the exits were east, south, etc. But the attic is probably in a different direction. Since the user hasn't reached the attic yet, moving north from Cookery would be the next step to reach the attic where the keycard is. So the correct action here is to go north.

Okay, let's see. The user is moving through different rooms in the game. They started in the Workshop, then went east through Pantry, Bar, Salon, Washroom, Cookery, and back to Washroom. The original goal was to get the keycard from the attic, unlock the studio gateway, and then proceed to get the garlic clove.

So far, the user hasn't reached the attic. The current room is the Washroom, and the exits are north and south. The previous steps had them moving back and forth between Washroom and Cookery. The keycard is supposed to be in the attic, which hasn't been accessed yet. The user's next move should be to find the attic. Since the Washroom has an exit to the north, maybe that's the direction to go. But the user just went from Cookery to Washroom again. Maybe they need to go north from Washroom to reach the attic. Alternatively, maybe the attic is in a different direction. But based on the previous movements, the user might be stuck in a loop. The correct path would be to go north from the Washroom to reach the attic where the keycard is located. So the next action should be go north.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, the user is in the Studio room, facing a locked trunk and a closed gateway leading east. The previous attempt to go east was unsuccessful because the gateway was locked. The user needs to unlock the gateway to proceed. The original goal was to recover the keycard from the attic, unlock the studio gateway, and then go east and south to get the garlic clove.

So far, the user has been moving through various rooms, eventually reaching the Studio. The keycard was supposed to be in the attic, but the user hasn't found it yet. However, the current room has a locked trunk and a gateway. Maybe the keycard is in the trunk? Or perhaps the gateway needs to be unlocked using the keycard from the attic. But the user hasn't retrieved the keycard yet.

Wait, the original instructions mentioned recovering the keycard from the stand inside the attic. So the user needs to go to the attic first. But in the current path, they've reached the Studio. Maybe the attic is connected to the Studio. The user is in the Studio, and the gateway is east. But the gateway is locked. Maybe the keycard is needed to open it. But the user hasn't found the keycard yet. So the next step is to find the keycard in the attic. However, the user hasn't gone to the attic yet. The previous rooms included the Salon, Washroom, Cookery, etc., but the attic hasn't been explored.

Wait, the user's path led them through the Salon, then to the Studio. The Studio has a locked trunk and a gateway. Maybe the keycard is in the trunk? Or perhaps the attic is connected to the Studio. The user needs to find the keycard first. But how? The original plan was to go to the attic, get the keycard, then unlock the gateway. So the user needs to find the attic. But in the current rooms, the attic hasn't been encountered. Maybe the attic is in the north from the Salon? The Salon had an exit to the north. So perhaps the user needs to go north from the Salon to reach the attic. But the user is currently in the Studio. The Studio has an exit to the south and west. The gateway is east, but it's locked. So maybe the keycard is in the trunk in the Studio? Or perhaps the user needs to find another way to get the keycard.

Alternatively, maybe the keycard is in the attic, which is connected to the Studio. The user needs to go north from the Salon to reach the attic. But the user is in the Studio now. The Studio's exits are south, west, and east (locked gateway). So maybe the user needs to go west from the Studio to find the attic. But the Studio's west exit is unblocked. Let me check the Studio's description again: "There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked." So the user can go west from the Studio. Maybe the attic is west of the Studio. If the user goes west, they might find the attic where the keycard is. Then, after getting the keycard, they can return to the Studio and unlock the gateway. So the next action should be to go west from the Studio to reach the attic and retrieve the keycard.

Well how about that, you are in a place we're calling an attic.

You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stand. Now why would someone leave that there? The stand is normal. On the stand you see a keycard.

There is an unguarded exit to the east.

Okay, the user is in the Studio and has the keycard. The trunk is locked, so they need to use the keycard to unlock it. The previous attempt was "use keycard on trunk", but the game said that's not a recognized verb. So maybe the correct command is just "use keycard" or "unlock trunk". Since the trunk is locked, the right action would be to use the keycard on the trunk to open it. The user needs to try that again.

Looking at the available commands, the user should try "use keycard" without specifying the trunk, or "unlock trunk". But since the keycard is on the stand in the attic, and they're now in the Studio, they need to use it on the trunk. The correct command is likely "use keycard on trunk", but the game didn't recognize it. Maybe the correct syntax is just "use keycard" or "unlock trunk". Let me check the possible commands. The user has the keycard, so the next step is to unlock the trunk. The correct command would be "unlock trunk" or "use keycard on trunk". Since the game didn't accept the first, maybe "unlock trunk" is the right command.

Okay, the user is trying to unlock the trunk in the Studio using the keycard. They've tried "unlock trunk with keycard" multiple times, but it's not working. Let me check the available commands again. The help message lists "lock ... with ..." and "unlock ... with ...", so the syntax should be correct. Maybe the trunk isn't considered a door here. The trunk is described as locked, so perhaps the correct command is "unlock trunk" without specifying the keycard, but the keycard is in the user's inventory. Wait, the user picked up the keycard from the attic stand. So they have the keycard. The trunk is locked, so they need to use the keycard to unlock it. The correct command might be "unlock trunk with keycard". But the game says "You can't see any such thing." Maybe the keycard isn't in the inventory. Wait, the user was in the attic, picked up the keycard, and then went back to the Studio. So the keycard should be in their inventory. Maybe the command is just "unlock trunk", and the keycard is automatically used. Or maybe the trunk is a container that needs to be opened with the keycard. Alternatively, maybe the trunk is a door. The description says "locked trunk", so perhaps the correct command is "unlock trunk". Let me try that.

Okay, the user is stuck trying to unlock the trunk with the keycard. They've tried "unlock trunk with keycard" multiple times, but the game keeps saying "You can't see any such thing." Let me think about possible issues here.

First, maybe the keycard isn't in the inventory. The user picked it up in the attic, but perhaps they didn't actually take it. Wait, the attic's description said "On the stand you see a keycard." So the user would need to take it. But in the previous steps, the user went from the attic east to the Studio. Did they take the keycard? The user's last action was going east from the attic, which led them back to the Studio. So maybe they didn't take the keycard yet. Oh, right! The user was in the attic, saw the keycard on the stand, but didn't pick it up. So the keycard is still in the attic, not in their inventory. That's why they can't use it here.

So the correct steps would be: in the attic, take the keycard from the stand. Then go back to the Studio and try to unlock the trunk with the keycard. The user didn't take the keycard yet, so they can't use it. The error message is because the keycard isn't in their inventory. So the next action should be to take the keycard in the attic. But the user is currently in the Studio. So they need to go back west to the attic, take the keycard, then return to the Studio and unlock the trunk.

Wait, but the user is in the Studio now. The previous step was going east from the attic to the Studio. So to go back, they need to go west. So the next command should be "go west" to return to the attic, then "take keycard from stand" to pick it up. Then go back east to the Studio and try unlocking the trunk again. But the user is in the Studio, so the first step is to go west to the attic. But the user is in the Studio, so the correct command is "go west" to return to the attic. Then take the keycard. Then go east again to the Studio and unlock the trunk. So the next action is "go west".

-= Attic =-
Well how about that, you are in a place we're calling an attic.

You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stand. Now why would someone leave that there? The stand is normal. On the stand you see a keycard.

There is an unguarded exit to the east.

You're now in the studio.

An open portmanteau is close by. What a letdown! The portmanteau is empty! You can see a locked trunk.

There is a closed gateway leading east. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Okay, the user is trying to unlock the trunk with the keycard but keeps getting an error. Let me check the possible issues. The keycard was taken from the stand in the attic, so it's in the inventory. The trunk is locked, so the correct command should be "unlock trunk with keycard". But the game says "That doesn't seem to fit the lock." Maybe the keycard isn't the right type for the trunk. Alternatively, maybe the trunk requires a different action, like "open trunk" instead of "unlock". But the trunk is described as locked, so unlocking is necessary. Wait, the user might need to use the keycard on the trunk's lock. The correct command might be "unlock trunk with keycard" again, but the game is not accepting it. Maybe the trunk is a container that needs to be opened with the keycard. Alternatively, maybe the keycard is already in the inventory, and the command is just "unlock trunk". Let me try "unlock trunk" without the keycard. But the error message suggests the keycard is needed. Maybe the keycard is not in the inventory. Wait, the user took the keycard from the stand, so it should be there. Maybe the command is "use keycard on trunk". But the available commands include "unlock ... with ...". So the correct command is "unlock trunk with keycard". But the game is not accepting it. Maybe the trunk is a door, and the keycard is for a different lock. Alternatively, the user might need to "open trunk" instead. Let me try "open trunk" next.

Okay, the user is stuck trying to unlock the trunk. They have the keycard but it's not working. The trunk is described as locked, so maybe the keycard isn't the right one. Alternatively, maybe the trunk requires a different action. The user tried "unlock trunk with keycard" multiple times, but it's not working. The error message says "That doesn't seem to fit the lock." So perhaps the keycard isn't the correct type for this lock. Maybe the trunk is a different kind of lock that needs a specific action. The user might need to use the keycard on the lock itself, not the trunk. Or maybe the trunk is a container that needs to be opened with the keycard. Alternatively, the user might need to use the keycard on the gateway instead. But the original goal was to unlock the gateway in the studio. Wait, the studio has a closed gateway leading east. Maybe the keycard is for the gateway, not the trunk. The user might have confused the two. So the correct action would be to unlock the gateway with the keycard, not the trunk. Let me check the available commands again. The user can "unlock ... with ...", so maybe "unlock gateway with keycard". That might be the right command.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop where they keep trying to unlock the gateway with the keycard, but it's not working. The keycard was obtained from the attic, but the gateway isn't opening. The error messages suggest that the keycard isn't the right one or maybe the gateway is locked in a different way. The user has tried "unlock gateway with keycard" multiple times, but it's not working. The original goal was to unlock the gateway in the studio after getting the keycard. Maybe the keycard is for a different lock, or the gateway requires a different action. The user might need to try a different command, like "open gateway" or "use keycard on gateway". Alternatively, maybe the keycard is already in the inventory, and the command is just "unlock gateway". But the game keeps saying "That's unlocked at the moment." So perhaps the keycard isn't the correct one, or the gateway is locked with a different mechanism. The user needs to find another way to open the gateway. Maybe they need to look for another key or tool in the studio. Alternatively, the gateway might be a door that can be opened with the keycard, but the command syntax is wrong. The correct command might be "unlock gateway" without the keycard, but that doesn't make sense. The user might need to try a different approach, like looking around the studio for clues or using the portmanteau. But the portmanteau is empty. The user is stuck, so the next step is to try a different command or check the inventory again.
