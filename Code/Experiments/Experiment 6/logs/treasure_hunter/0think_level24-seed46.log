I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! First thing I need you to do is to attempt to move south. Then, make an attempt to move south. And then, go west. And then, go west. Once you manage that, take a trip north. Once you manage that, venture east. And then, travel north. That done, try to move west. Okay, and then, recover the key from the floor of the cubicle. Alright, thanks!

-= Cellar =-
I am sorry to announce that you are now in the cellar.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Of every bar you could have sauntered into, you had to come round a normal one.
