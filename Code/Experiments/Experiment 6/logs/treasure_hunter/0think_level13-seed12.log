Welcome to TextWorld! Your first objective is to make an effort to take a trip west. And then, go to the south. After that, head west. With that accomplished, lift the fly larva from the floor of the cookhouse. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Cubicle =-
Well, here we are in a cubicle. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.



There is an open door leading south. There is an open gateway leading west.

-= Study =-
Of every study you could have walked into, you had to come round an usual one. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You see a locked coffer. You make out a trunk. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You scan the room for a stand, and you find a stand. The stand is typical. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is an open gateway leading east. There is an open gate leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

-= Salon =-
You find yourself in a salon. A normal kind of place. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

Look over there! a safe. The safe is empty! What a waste of a day! You can make out a bar. The bar is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Launderette =-
You arrive in a launderette. A typical kind of place.

You can see a bench. The bench is ordinary. However, the bench, like an empty bench, has nothing on it.

There is an open gate leading east. There is an open portal leading south. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

-= Salon =-
You find yourself in a salon. A normal kind of place. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

Look over there! a safe. The safe is empty! What a waste of a day! You can make out a bar. The bar is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked.
