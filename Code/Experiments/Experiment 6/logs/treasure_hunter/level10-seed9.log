You are now playing a exciting session of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First stop, try to go south. Then, move south. Next, make an attempt to take a trip west. Then, make an effort to venture north. And then, retrieve the banana from the floor of the workshop. That's it!

-= Bedchamber =-
You've just walked into a bedchamber.



You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Shower =-
You've entered a shower.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing a text-based game called TextWorld. The goal is to navigate through different rooms and retrieve the banana from the workshop. So far, they've moved from the Bedchamber to the Shower. The current room is the Shower, and the possible directions are north, south, and west.

The user's last action was "go south" from the Bedchamber, which led them to the Shower. Now, they need to decide their next move. The instructions mention trying to go south again, then west, then north, and finally get the banana. 

In the Shower room, the available exits are north, south, and west. The user's next step should be to go west as per the initial plan. But wait, the user is asking if they're on the right track. The assistant needs to confirm that the current path is correct. 

The user's previous moves were south (from Bedchamber to Shower), then the next step would be to go west. But the user is now asking if they're close to the goal. The assistant should respond with the next action based on the initial plan: take a trip west. So the next command should be "go west".
</think>go west

-= Workshop =-
You find yourself in a workshop. A typical kind of place.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

There is a banana on the floor.


>                                                                                                                                -= Workshop =-0/3
Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, let me figure out what to do next. The user is in the Workshop, which is the third room. The goal is to retrieve the banana from the floor of the workshop. The current room has a banana on the floor, so the next logical step is to pick it up.

Looking at the available commands, the user has to interact with the environment. Since the banana is on the floor, the correct action would be to take the banana. The previous steps were moving south, then west, which led to the workshop. Now, the banana is here, so the next command should be "take banana" or "get banana". But in TextWorld, the correct command is usually "take" followed by the item name. So the right action is "take banana".
</think>take banana
