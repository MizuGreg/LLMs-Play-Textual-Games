It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First thing I need you to do is to attempt to take a trip north. And then, pick-up the book from the floor of the workshop. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Lounge =-
You've entered a typical room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be typical. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the lounge. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Workshop =-
You arrive in a workshop. A typical kind of place.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

There is a book on the floor.
