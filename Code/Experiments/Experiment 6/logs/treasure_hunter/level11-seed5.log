Welcome to another fast paced session of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First thing I need you to do is to make an effort to go south. Then, pick-up the chocolate bar from the floor of the chamber. That's it!

-= Kitchenette =-
I just think it's great that you've just entered a kitchenette.

You can see a freezer.

There is an open hatch leading north. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Chamber =-
You make another one of your grand eccentric entrances into a chamber.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the north.

There is a chocolate bar on the floor.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and collect items. The goal mentioned is to pick up the chocolate bar and go south. 

First, the user started in the Kitchenette, went south into the Chamber. The Chamber has a chocolate bar on the floor. The user's next step should be to pick up the chocolate bar. The previous action was "go south", which led them to the Chamber. Now, the prompt says to pick up the chocolate bar.

The user's current location is the Chamber. The available exits are east and north. But the chocolate bar is on the floor, so the correct action here is to pick it up. The user needs to use the command "take chocolate bar" or similar. But in TextWorld, the exact command might be "get chocolate bar" or "pick up chocolate bar". The user has to input the correct command to pick it up. Then, after picking up the chocolate bar, they might need to go south again to reach the original goal. But the user's next action should be to pick up the chocolate bar first. So the correct command here is "take chocolate bar".
