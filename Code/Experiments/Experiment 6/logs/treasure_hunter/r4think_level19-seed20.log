Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, make absolutely sure that the hatch is open. Then, take a trip east. With that over with, make an attempt to venture east. Once you succeed at that, open the gate in the study. Then, make an attempt to go to the north. Once you manage that, attempt to go to the west. With that over with, take a trip north. With that over with, go north. And then, pick up the loaf of bread from the floor of the launderette. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Garage =-
You are in a garage. An ordinary one. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

Hey, want to see a cabinet? Look over there, a cabinet. You can see a locked chest.

There is a closed hatch leading east. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

-= Salon =-
You arrive in a salon. A normal one. You begin looking for stuff.

You can see a trunk. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a bench. You shudder, but continue examining the bench. The bench is standard. The bench appears to be empty.

There is an open hatch leading west. There is an open door leading east.

There is a fondue on the floor.

-= Study =-
You've entered a study. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

A locked portmanteau is in the corner.

There is a closed gate leading north. There is an open door leading west.



>                                                                                                                                -= Study =-0/4

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game and has followed a series of steps. They started in the garage, opened the hatch, went east to the salon, then east again to the study. In the study, they opened the gate leading north. Now they're at the study, and the next step according to the original instructions was to go north after opening the gate.

The user is asking if they're on the right track and close to the goal. The current location is the study, and the next logical step would be to go north. The previous action was opening the gate, so the next command should be "go north". The user needs to confirm that this is the correct next step. Since the gate was just opened, moving north through the gate makes sense. The original goal was to pick up the bread from the launderette, so proceeding north might lead to the next steps required for that. Therefore, the correct next action is to go north.

-= Chamber =-
You've just sauntered into a chamber.

You can see a desk. The desk is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open gate leading south. There is an open portal leading north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user has been moving through different rooms in the game: garage, salon, study, chamber, playroom. The original goal was to pick up the loaf of bread from the launderette. So far, they've opened various gates and hatches, moved east and west, but haven't encountered the launderette yet.

In the current Playroom, the user is told to try going east since the entranceway is unguarded. They did that, and it led back to the Chamber. Now, they're in the Playroom again, and the next step might be to check north. The original plan was to go north after opening the gate in the study, then west, then north again, and finally get the bread. But the path seems to be looping between chambers and playroom. Maybe the bread is in a different location, or perhaps the correct path requires exploring other areas. The user needs to continue moving north or east to find the launderette. The next action should be to go north from the Playroom.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a loop between the Playroom, Chamber, and Basement. The original goal was to get the bread from the launderette. So far, they've checked several rooms but haven't found the launderette yet. The current location is the Chamber again. The previous steps involved moving east, west, north, south, but no luck. Maybe the launderette is in a different area, or perhaps the correct path requires a different sequence. The next step should be to check north again from the Chamber, as the portal leading north is open. Alternatively, maybe going west from the Chamber could lead to another area. But according to the previous instructions, after opening the gate in the study, they should go north, then west, then north again. But the path seems to be looping. Maybe the bread is in the Basement, but the user hasn't checked there yet. The next action should be to go north from the Chamber to proceed further.

Okay, the user has been stuck in a loop between the Playroom, Chamber, and Basement for a while. The original goal was to get the bread from the launderette. So far, they haven't found it. The current location is the Basement. The next step should be to check east in the Basement since there's an open passageway leading east. Maybe that's where the launderette is. Alternatively, going south might lead to another area. But based on the previous pattern, going east seems more promising.

Okay, the user tried to type "go east" again, but the game said that's not a recognized verb. Hmm, maybe the correct command is different. Let me check the previous interactions. The user has been using "go [direction]" commands like "go north", "go east", etc. But maybe the game expects a different phrasing. Wait, in the initial instructions, the user was told to reply with a short command like "go north". Maybe "go east" is correct, but perhaps the game is case-sensitive or there's a typo. Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "east" without "go". Let me look at the game's responses. For example, when the user first said "go north", the game responded with the next scene. So maybe "go east" is correct. But the game is rejecting it. Maybe the user needs to use a different verb, like "move east" or "travel east". Alternatively, maybe the game uses "walk east" or "head east". But the initial examples used "go", so perhaps the user should try "go east" again. Wait, the user just tried "go east" again, and the game said it's not recognized. Maybe the game expects "east" as the command without "go". Let me check the previous valid commands. The first action was "open hatch", then "go east", then "open gate", etc. So "go east" was accepted before. Maybe the game is having a glitch. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use "move east" or another verb. But the user is instructed to only output the action, like "go north". So perhaps the correct command is "east" instead of "go east". Let me check the game's response when the user tried "go east" again. The game said "That's not a verb I recognise." So maybe the correct command is just "east" without "go". Let me try that. The user's next action should be "east".

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Playroom and Chamber. They keep trying to go east and west, but it's not working. The original goal was to get the bread from the launderette. So far, they haven't found it. The current location is the Chamber again. The instruction says to try going west. But the user is repeating the same steps. Maybe they need to find another way or check other areas. The next action should be to go west again, as per the previous instruction.

-= Chamber =-
You've just sauntered into a chamber.

You can see a desk. The desk is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open gate leading south. There is an open portal leading north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.
