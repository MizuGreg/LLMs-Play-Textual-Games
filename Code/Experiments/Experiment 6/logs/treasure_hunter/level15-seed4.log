Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First stop, try to move east. With that over with, venture north. Once you get around to doing that, try to venture east. With that accomplished, make an attempt to head south. If you can get through with that, try to travel south. After that, pick up the napkin from the floor of the scullery. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Cookhouse =-
Here we are in the cookhouse. You begin looking for stuff.

You make out a case. The case is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever!

There is an open gate leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

-= Parlor =-
You've entered a parlor.

You can see a bed stand. You wonder idly who left that here. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game and has already moved east from the cookhouse into the parlor. The goal is to pick up the napkin from the scullery and then win. So far, the user has gone east (from cookhouse to parlor), then the system prompted them to go west, but they didn't respond yet.

Looking at the current location, the parlor has an exit to the north and a west entrance. The user's previous action was "go east", which took them to the parlor. Now, the next step according to the initial instructions was to venture north, then east again, then south, then south again, then pick up the napkin.

Wait, the user's first action was "go east" from the cookhouse. Then the next step in the original instructions was to "venture north". But in the parlor, the exits are north and west. So maybe the user needs to go north from the parlor. But the system's last message says that in the parlor, there's an exit to the north and west. The user hasn't moved yet from the parlor. So the next action should be to go north, as per the original plan. But the user might be confused because the initial instructions said after going east, venture north. But in the parlor, going north would take them back to the cookhouse? Or maybe to another area.

Wait, the original goal was to go east, then north, then east, then south, then south, then pick up the napkin. So after the first east (to parlor), then north. But in the parlor, the north exit is unblocked. So going north from parlor would take them back to cookhouse? Or maybe to another room. But the cookhouse had a north exit. Wait, the cookhouse had an exit to the north and an open gate to the south. So maybe going north from parlor would take them back to cookhouse. But the user's goal is to get to the scullery. So maybe the path is cookhouse -> parlor -> ... ?

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west from the parlor. The parlor has a west entrance. But the original instructions said after going east (to parlor), venture north. So perhaps the user should go north from parlor. But the user hasn't done that yet. The system's last message says that in the parlor, the north exit is unblocked. So the next action should be "go north" to proceed. But the user might not know that. The user's question is whether they're making the right actions and if they're close to the goal. The user's current location is the parlor, and the next step according to the original plan was to go north. So the correct next action is "go north".

-= Shower =-
You find yourself in a shower. A typical kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

You can see a closed box in the room. You make out a locked safe.

There is an open door leading east. There is an unguarded exit to the south. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text adventure game. The original goal was to move east, then north, then east again, south, south again, pick up the napkin from the scullery, and win. So far, the user has gone from the Cookhouse to the Parlor, then to the Shower.

In the Shower room, there's a closed box and a locked safe. The exits are east (open door), south (unguarded), and west (unguarded). The user's last action was going west. Wait, no, the user's last action was "go west" as the suggestion. But the user hasn't actually done that yet. Wait, the last prompt was the Shower room, and the assistant suggested "go west". But the user hasn't executed that yet. Wait, no, the user's last input was the assistant's suggestion, and the user hasn't responded yet. Wait, the user is asking if they're making the right actions and if they're close to the goal. So the user is at the Shower room, and the assistant's previous action was "go west". But the user hasn't done that yet. Wait, maybe I need to check the history again.

Wait, the user's initial moves were: go east (from Cookhouse to Parlor), then go north (from Parlor to Shower). Now, in the Shower, the options are east, south, west. The previous assistant suggestion was "go west". So the user is at the Shower, and the next step is to go west. But the user is asking if they're on the right track. The original plan was to go east, north, east, south, south, pick up napkin. But so far, the user has gone east (Cookhouse to Parlor), then north (Parlor to Shower). Now, from Shower, the next step in the original plan was to go south. But the current options are east, south, west. The user's previous action was "go west" (as the assistant's suggestion). Wait, maybe the user is supposed to go south from the Shower. But the assistant's last suggestion was to go west. Hmm.

Wait, the original instructions said: after moving east, north, then east again, then south, then south again. So after the initial moves (east, north, east), then south, then south. But the user is now in the Shower. Let me check the path again.

Original path: Cookhouse (start) → go east → Parlor → go north → Shower. Then from Shower, the next step in the original plan was to go east (as per the first instruction: "try to venture east" after moving north). Wait, the original instructions said: first stop, try to move east. Then venture north. Then try to venture east again. Then south, then south again. So after moving north (from Parlor to Shower), the next step was to go east. But in the Shower, the east door is open. So maybe the user should go east from Shower. But the assistant's previous suggestion was to go west. That might be conflicting.

Wait, the user is in the Shower. The original plan after moving north (to Shower) was to go east again. But the current options are east (open door), south (unguarded), west (unguarded). So the correct next step would be to go east. But the assistant's previous suggestion was to go west. That might be a mistake. So the user is at the Shower, and the next step should be east. But the user is asking if they're on the right track. So maybe the assistant should suggest going east again. However, the user's last action was "go west" as the assistant's suggestion. Wait, no, the user hasn't done that yet. The user is at the Shower, and the assistant's previous suggestion was to go west. But the user hasn't executed that yet. So the user is asking if they're on the right track. The assistant needs to decide whether to go west or east.

But according to the original plan, after moving north to the Shower, the next step was to go east. So the correct action would be to go east. However, the assistant's previous suggestion was to go west. That might be a mistake. So perhaps the user is not on the right track. Therefore, the correct next action is to go east. But the user is in the Shower, and the east door is open. So the assistant should suggest "go east" as the next action. But the user is asking if they're on the right track. So the answer would be that they are not, because they should go east instead of west. Therefore, the next action should be "go east".

-= Cookery =-
You are in an usual kind of place. That is to say, you're in a cookery.

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a table. On the table you can make out a stick of butter. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now.

There is an open portal leading south. There is an open door leading west.



>                                                                                                                                -= Cookery =-0/4

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text adventure game, and their goal is to follow a series of directions to eventually pick up the napkin in the scullery and win. Let me recap the steps they've taken so far.

Starting in the Cookhouse, they first went east, then north to the Parlor, then east again to the Shower, and then north to the Cookery. The original instructions were to move east, then north, then east, then south, then south again, then pick up the napkin.

Wait, the user's current location is the Cookery. The next step in the original plan after going north from the Shower was to go east again, but maybe the directions are a bit different. Let me check the original goal again.

Original goal: First, move east. Then north. Then east again. Then south. Then south again. Then pick up the napkin.

But the user has already done east (from Cookhouse to Parlor), then north (Parlor to Shower), then east (Shower to Cookery). Now, the next step according to the original plan is to go south from Cookery. Let me check the current room description.

In the Cookery, the exits are a portal south and a door west. So the user needs to go south from here. The original plan says after going east, go south twice. So from Cookery, going south would be the first south move. Then from there, maybe another south? But let's see.

Wait, the user's current position is Cookery. The next step in the original instructions is to go south. So the correct action here is to go south. The user has to follow the steps in order: east, north, east, south, south, then pick up the napkin.

So the next command should be 'go south' from the Cookery. That's the next step in the sequence. The user is on the right track. They need to go south from Cookery, then perhaps another south, then find the napkin. Let me make sure there's no confusion with the directions. The Cookery has a portal south, so that's the correct exit to take. The user should proceed with 'go south' now.

-= Canteen =-
You are in a canteen. A standard kind of place.



There is an open portal leading north. There is an unguarded exit to the south.



>                                                                                                                                -= Canteen =-0/5
Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and eventually pick up a napkin from the scullery to win. So far, the player has moved east, north, east, south, and now they're in the canteen.

Looking at the current room description for the canteen, there's an open portal leading north and an unguarded exit to the south. The original goal was to go east, north, east, south, south, then pick up the napkin in the scullery. 

Wait, the user's previous action was "go south" from the canteen. Now they're in the canteen, and the next step would be to check if they're moving towards the scullery. The scullery is mentioned in the original instructions, so maybe the canteen is part of the path leading to it. 

But the canteen has a north portal and a south exit. If the player goes north from the canteen, they might be heading back towards the cookery or another area. However, the original plan was to go south twice. Wait, the original instructions said after going south once (from the cookery to canteen), then try to travel south again. So maybe from the canteen, going south would take them to the next area, perhaps the scullery. But the canteen's description says there's an unguarded exit to the south. So maybe that's the direction to go. 

But the user's last action was "go south" to get to the canteen. Now they need to go south again from the canteen. Wait, but the canteen's south exit is unguarded. So the next step would be to go south again. But the user is at the canteen now. The original goal was to go south twice. So after the canteen, going south again would take them to the scullery. Then they can pick up the napkin. 

So the next action should be "go south" again. But the user is at the canteen, and the south exit is available. So the correct next step is to go south again. Then they would reach the scullery, pick up the napkin, and win. Therefore, the next command should be "go south".

-= Scullery =-
You arrive in a scullery. A standard one.

You make out a closed refrigerator here.

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

There is a napkin on the floor.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text adventure game. Their goal is to follow a series of directions: move east, then north, then east again, then south, then south again, pick up the napkin from the scullery, and win.

So far, the user has navigated through the Cookhouse, Parlor, Shower, Cookery, and Canteen. Now they're in the Scullery. The final step is to pick up the napkin on the floor here. The current room description mentions a closed refrigerator and the napkin on the floor. The user needs to pick up the napkin. Since the game's last instruction was to pick up the napkin once in the scullery, the next action should be to take the napkin. But the available commands might be limited. The user has to check if "take napkin" is a valid command here. Since the game's previous steps required moving to the scullery, and the napkin is there, the correct action is to pick it up. So the answer should be "take napkin".
