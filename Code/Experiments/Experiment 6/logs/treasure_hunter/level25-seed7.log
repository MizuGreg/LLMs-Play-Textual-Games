Welcome to TextWorld! Here is how to play! First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to go east. Once you get through with that, make an effort to go to the north. Once you accomplish that, try to head east. Following that, venture east. Then, go north. And then, go east. Then, make an attempt to go to the south. If you can do that, take a trip south. Following that, make an attempt to head west. And then, take a trip west. And then, retrieve the keycard from the saucepan. That's it!

-= Kitchen =-
Well, here we are in the kitchen.

You make out an opened freezer. The freezer is empty, what a horrible day!

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing a text-based game and has followed a specific path. The goal mentioned was to retrieve the keycard from the saucepan. So far, they've gone from the Kitchen to the Cookery. The current location is Cookery, and the possible exits are east, north, and west.

The user's previous action was "go east" from the Kitchen, which led them to Cookery. Now, in Cookery, the directions mentioned are east, north, and west. The user's next step should follow the initial instructions given at the start, which were a sequence of directions: east, north, east, east, north, east, south, south, west, west, then get the keycard from the saucepan.

But the user is asking if they're on the right track and if they're close to the goal. The assistant needs to decide the next move based on the initial plan. Let's check the sequence again:

Original instructions:
1. Go east (from Kitchen)
2. Go north
3. Go east
4. Go east
5. Go north
6. Go east
7. Go south
8. Go south
9. Go west
10. Go west
11. Retrieve keycard from saucepan.

Currently, the user is in Cookery. The previous move was east from Kitchen to Cookery. The next step in the sequence after that was to go north. But in the Cookery room, the user is told that there's an unblocked exit to the north. So following the initial plan, the next action should be to go north. However, the user is asking if they're close, so maybe they need to check if the path is correct.

But the user's last action was "go east" from Kitchen to Cookery. Now, in Cookery, the next step according to the original plan was to go north. So the next command should be "go north". However, the user is in Cookery and the possible exits are east, north, west. The user's next move should be north as per the initial instructions. Therefore, the correct next action is "go north".

Okay, let's see. The user is playing a text adventure game, and they've been following a specific path. The original goal was to retrieve the keycard from the saucepan, but the current location is the Dish-Pit.

Looking at the current room description: the Dish-Pit has exits to the east, north, south, and west. The user's previous actions were going east from the Kitchen, then north to Cookery, then north again to Dish-Pit. Now, they need to decide the next move.

The user's strategy so far has been to go east, then north, then east again. But in the Dish-Pit, the possible exits are east, north, south, and west. The original plan was to go east, north, east, north, east, south, west, and then get the keycard. But maybe the path is different here.

Wait, the user's initial instructions were to go east, then north, then east, then north, then east, then south, then west. But in the Dish-Pit, the user is at step 3 (Dish-Pit). The next step in the original plan was to go north again. But the Dish-Pit has a north exit. However, the user might need to check if the keycard is in a place that's accessible through these exits. Alternatively, maybe the keycard is in the saucepan, which is in a different room.

But the user's current position is the Dish-Pit. The next action according to the original plan was to go north. However, the Dish-Pit's north exit is unblocked. So going north would be the next step. But the user might need to check if that's the right direction. Alternatively, maybe the keycard is in a room that's accessible via south or west. But the original plan says after going north in Dish-Pit, the next step is east again. Wait, the original plan was after going north in Dish-Pit, then east. But the user's next move should follow the original sequence.

Wait, the original plan was: after entering Dish-Pit (step 3), the next step was to go north. Then, after that, go east. But the user is at Dish-Pit now. The next step according to the original plan is to go north. So the correct action here is to go north. But the user's previous action was going north to Dish-Pit, so maybe the next step is to go east again. Wait, the original plan says after Dish-Pit, go east. But the user is in Dish-Pit, so the next step is to go east. However, the current room's description says that in Dish-Pit, you can go east, north, south, or west. The original plan says after Dish-Pit, go east. So the next action should be go east. But the user's previous action was going north to get here. So the next step is east. But the user's next move should be east. However, the user's current location is Dish-Pit, and the next step in the original plan is to go east. So the correct command is go east.

You are in a vault. A typical kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.



There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an unblocked exit to the south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing a text adventure game, and they've been following a specific path. The original goal was to retrieve the keycard from the saucepan, but so far, they've moved through the kitchen, cookery, dish-pit, and now the vault.

In the vault, the possible exits are east, south, and west. The user's previous actions were going east, then north, then east again. Now, in the vault, they need to decide the next move. The prompt says to consider if they're on the right track and if they're close to the goal. 

The keycard is in the saucepan, which might be in a different area. So far, they've been moving east and north, which might not be leading them directly to the saucepan. Maybe they need to check other directions. The vault has an unblocked exit to the west, so maybe going west could lead them to another area where the saucepan is. Alternatively, the south or east exits might lead to places with the keycard. But since the user's original path was to go east, north, east, north, east, south, west, etc., perhaps they need to continue exploring the vault's exits. 

Since the user is in the vault, and the next step is to decide between east, south, or west. The original plan was to go east, then north, then east, then north, then east, then south, then west. But in the vault, the user might need to go west to check if that leads to the saucepan. Alternatively, maybe the keycard is in the vault itself. But the user hasn't found it yet. So the next logical step would be to check the west exit, as that's unblocked. So the answer should be "go west".

Okay, let's see. The user is following a set of instructions to move through different rooms in the game. They started in the kitchen, went east to Cookery, then north to Dish-Pit, east again to Vault, and west back to Dish-Pit. Now they're back in the Dish-Pit again.

The original goal was to retrieve the keycard from the saucepan. So far, the user has been moving around, but they haven't found the keycard yet. The current room is the Dish-Pit, and the possible exits are east, north, south, and west. The user's next action should be to check if any of these exits lead closer to the keycard. 

Looking at the previous steps, the Vault was a room with possible exits to east and south. Maybe the keycard is in one of those areas. But since the user is back in the Dish-Pit, they need to decide which direction to go next. The instructions mentioned going east, north, south, west in a specific order. The user has already tried east and west, so maybe next is north or south. 

The user's next action should be to go north, as per the initial plan. But wait, in the Dish-Pit, the prompt says "You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an unguarded exit to the south. There is an unblocked exit to the west." So the user should try going north. But the user previously went east and west, so maybe the next step is north. However, the user is at Dish-Pit again, so maybe they need to check if the keycard is here or if they need to go further. 

Alternatively, since the keycard is in the saucepan, maybe the user needs to find a room with a saucepan. The original instruction said to retrieve the keycard from the saucepan. So perhaps the user needs to find the saucepan. But the current room is Dish-Pit. The user might need to check if the saucepan is here, but the description doesn't mention it. 

Alternatively, the user might need to go east from the Dish-Pit to the Cookery again, but that's where they came from. Maybe the keycard is in the Vault. The Vault had an unblocked exit to the east and south. The user was in the Vault and went west back to Dish-Pit. Maybe the keycard is in the Vault. But the user hasn't checked there yet. 

Wait, the user's initial plan was to go east, north, east, north, east, south, west, west, and then retrieve the keycard. But the current step is in Dish-Pit again. The user might need to go north from here. The next action should be "go north" again. But the user has already done that before. Alternatively, maybe the user should go south from the Dish-Pit, which is unguarded. 

But according to the initial plan, after going north to Dish-Pit, the next steps were to go east, then north, then east, then north, then east, then south, then west, then west. But the user is back in Dish-Pit again. Maybe the next step is to go north again. But the user needs to follow the original instructions. The original instructions said after going north, then east, then north, then east, then north, then east, then south, then west, then west. 

Wait, the original instructions were: go east, then north, then east, then north, then east, then south, then west, then west, then retrieve keycard. So after the first few steps, the user is in Dish-Pit again. The next step would be to go north again. But the user is in Dish-Pit, and the prompt says "You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north." So the user should go north. 

But the user is at Dish-Pit, and the next action is to go north. So the answer should be "go north".

Okay, let's see. The user is navigating through different rooms in a text-based game. The original goal was to retrieve the keycard from the saucepan. So far, they've moved through the Kitchen, Cookery, Dish-Pit, Vault, and now the Washroom.

In the Washroom, the available exits are north, south, and west. The提示 says to try going north for an unguarded exit, and south is unblocked. The user's previous actions followed a pattern of moving east, north, east, west, north. Now, in the Washroom, the next logical step might be to check the south exit since it's unblocked. But the user's previous actions sometimes went north when advised. However, the original plan was to go east, north, east, east, north, south, west, west, then get the keycard. 

But in the current room, the user is in the Washroom. The original goal was to get the keycard from the saucepan. Maybe the keycard is in a specific location. The user needs to find the right path. Since the user is in the Washroom, maybe moving south would take them back to the Dish-Pit or another area. Alternatively, going west might be an option. But the提示 says south is unblocked. The user might need to explore different paths to find the keycard. Since the previous steps were following a certain direction, but the game's layout is a bit complex, the next action should be to go south as per the current room's提示. Alternatively, maybe north again. But the user's previous action was going north to the Washroom, so maybe the next step is to check the south exit. Let me check the current room's description again. The Washroom says: "You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west." So the options are north, south, or west. The user's previous movement was north to get here. The original plan was to go south after reaching the Washroom? Or maybe the keycard is in a different location. But the user hasn't found it yet. The keycard is in the saucepan, which might be in a specific room. Since the user is in the Washroom, maybe moving south would take them to the Dish-Pit again, and then perhaps explore further. Alternatively, going west might lead to another area. But the user's original plan was to go south, then west. So maybe the next step is to go south here. But the user's previous action was going north to get to the Washroom. So the next step could be to go south. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west. But the prompt says to try south as it's unblocked. So the next action should be south.

Looking at the previous steps, after entering the Dish-Pit, the user was told to try going east or north. The last action was going south, which brought them back to the Dish-Pit. The next logical step, based on the initial instructions, would be to go east again. However, the user might be getting stuck in a loop. But since the game's feedback says to continue following the path, the next action should be east. Alternatively, since the user is in the Dish-Pit again, maybe they need to check for the keycard here, but the instruction was to retrieve it from the saucepan, which might be in another room.

Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text adventure game called TextWorld. The goal mentioned earlier was to retrieve the keycard from the saucepan. So far, the player has moved through several rooms: Kitchen, Cookery, Dish-Pit, Vault, Washroom, and back to Dish-Pit and Vault.

Looking at the current room, the Vault, the description says there's an unblocked exit to the east, south, and west. The user's previous action was "go east," which led back to the Vault. Now, the user is at the Vault again. The next step would be to check which directions are possible. The exits mentioned are east, south, and west. Since the player has already been through east and west, maybe the south is the next unexplored direction. But wait, the user's goal is to get the keycard from the saucepan. The saucepan might be in a different room. 

Alternatively, maybe the keycard is in the Vault. The user needs to find it. But the current room is the Vault, and the description doesn't mention a saucepan here. The earlier rooms like the Kitchen had an opened freezer, but the keycard is supposed to be in the saucepan. Maybe the saucepan is in the Cookery or another room. 

The user's path has been going back and forth between Dish-Pit and Vault. The next logical step might be to check the south exit from the Vault. If the south exit leads to another room, perhaps the Cookery or another area where the saucepan is. Alternatively, maybe the keycard is in the Vault, and the player needs to look around. But the instructions say to only output the action, so the next move should be based on the available exits. 

The Vault has unblocked exits to east, south, and west. The player has already tried east (back to Vault) and west (to Dish-Pit). So the next possible untried exit is south. Therefore, the next action should be "go south" to explore that direction.

Okay, let me figure out what to do next. The user's goal is to retrieve the keycard from the saucepan. Looking at the current room, the Scullery, there's a chest and a saucepan with the keycard on it. The exits are east, north, and west.

The user has been moving around, and now they're in the Scullery. The keycard is on the saucepan, so the next step is to pick it up. But the command format requires moving directions. Wait, the user needs to interact with the saucepan to get the keycard. However, the game's commands are about moving, not picking up items. But in the description, the saucepan is in the room, and the keycard is on it. So maybe the correct action is to take the keycard from the saucepan. But the game might require moving to the saucepan's location first. However, since the user is already in the Scullery, and the saucepan is here, perhaps the next step is to take the keycard. But the previous commands were about moving, so maybe the correct action is to take the keycard. But the user's previous actions were moving, so maybe the answer is to take the keycard. However, the game might require the user to go to the saucepan's location, but since they're already here, maybe the command is to take the keycard. But the system message says to only output the action, like "go north". So perhaps the correct action is to take the keycard. But the game's commands might not include taking items. Wait, the initial instructions said to retrieve the keycard from the saucepan. So maybe the correct action is to take the keycard. But the user's previous actions were moving, so maybe the answer is "take keycard from saucepan". But the system says to only output the command, like "go north". So perhaps the correct action is to take the keycard. However, in TextWorld, the command would be "take keycard" or "get keycard". But the user's previous actions were moving, so maybe the correct action here is to take the keycard. But the system might expect moving directions. Wait, the user is in the Scullery, and the saucepan is here. So the next step is to take the keycard. But the system requires only the command, like "go north". So maybe the correct action is "take keycard". But I need to check the game's possible commands. Since the user is in the Scullery, and the keycard is on the saucepan, the correct action is to take the keycard. Therefore, the answer is "take keycard".
