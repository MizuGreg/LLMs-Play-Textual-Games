Welcome to TextWorld! Here is how to play! First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to go east. Once you get through with that, make an effort to go to the north. Once you accomplish that, try to head east. Following that, venture east. Then, go north. And then, go east. Then, make an attempt to go to the south. If you can do that, take a trip south. Following that, make an attempt to head west. And then, take a trip west. And then, retrieve the keycard from the saucepan. That's it!

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text adventure game called TextWorld, and their goal is to retrieve the keycard from the saucepan in the scullery. So far, they've navigated through several rooms: Kitchen, Cookery, Scullery, Vault, Cubicle, Bathroom, back to Scullery, Vault again, Dish-Pit, Washroom, Shower, and now Kitchenette.

In the Kitchenette, the user sees a locked cabinet. The previous instruction was to go west from the Kitchenette, but the current room's description says "You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west." Wait, but the user is already in the Kitchenette. The only exit mentioned here is west, which would take them back to the previous room, which was the Kitchenette's west side. But the user is at the Kitchenette now. Maybe the locked cabinet is a clue. However, the user's goal is to get the keycard from the saucepan in the scullery. 

The keycard was previously in the scullery, which the user has already visited. But maybe the locked cabinet in the Kitchenette is a new obstacle. However, the user's last action was going east from the Shower to the Kitchenette. Now, in the Kitchenette, the only exit mentioned is west. But the user needs to get the keycard, which was already in the scullery. Wait, maybe the keycard is in the scullery, but the user hasn't picked it up yet. The user is currently in the Kitchenette, which is a new room. So perhaps the user needs to go back through the rooms to reach the scullery again to pick up the keycard. But the user's last action was going east to the Kitchenette, and now they're here. The instruction says to try going west from the Kitchenette. But the user might have already been in the scullery before. Let me check the history.

Looking back, the user was in the Scullery (0/7), then went north to Vault (0/8), then west to Dish-Pit (0/9), then north to Washroom (0/10), then north to Shower (0/11), then east to Kitchenette (0/12). So the user is now in the Kitchenette. The keycard was in the scullery, which is to the west of the Kitchenette? Wait, no. The user was in the Kitchenette, and the only exit mentioned is west. So going west from Kitchenette would take them back to where? Let me check the previous steps. The user was in the Kitchenette after coming from the Shower (east). So the west exit from Kitchenette would be back to the previous room, which was the Shower? No, the user was in the Kitchenette after coming from the Shower. Wait, the user was in the Shower (0/11), then went east to Kitchenette (0/12). So the west exit from Kitchenette would be back to the Shower. But the user's goal is to get the keycard from the scullery. So maybe the user needs to go back through the rooms to reach the scullery again. But the user hasn't picked up the keycard yet. In the Scullery (0/7), the keycard was on the saucepan. So the user needs to go back to the Scullery, pick up the keycard, and then proceed. However, the user is now in the Kitchenette. The only exit is west, which would take them back to the Shower. Then from there, maybe go north to the Washroom, then north to the Shower again? Wait, this seems confusing. Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go back through the path they came from to reach the Scullery again. But the user hasn't picked up the keycard yet. The keycard was in the Scullery, so the user needs to go back there. But how? The user is in the Kitchenette, and the only exit is west. So going west to the Shower, then north to the Washroom, then north to the Shower again? Wait, no. Let me retrace:

From Kitchenette (0/12), west leads to Shower (0/11). From Shower (0/11), north is the Shower room, east is Kitchenette. Then from Shower, south is the Washroom (0/10). From Washroom (0/10), north is Shower, south is Dish-Pit (0/9). From Dish-Pit (0/9), north is Washroom, west is Vault (0/8). From Vault (0/8), north is Scullery (0/7). Wait, no. The Vault (0/8) has exits east, south, and west. So from Vault, going west would be to the Dish-Pit (0/9)? Or maybe the other way around. This is getting a bit tangled. The user needs to get back to the Scullery to pick up the keycard. The keycard was in the Scullery, so the user must go back there. But the current path is in the Kitchenette. The only way is west to the Shower, then north to the Washroom, then north to the Shower again? Wait, no. From the Shower (0/11), north is the Shower room, but that's the same place. Maybe the user needs to go south from the Shower to the Washroom (0/10), then south to the Dish-Pit (0/9), then west to the Vault (0/8), then north to the Scullery (0/7). That would take them back to the Scullery where the keycard is. But the user hasn't done that yet. However, the user is now in the Kitchenette (0/12), and the only exit is west. So the next step is to go west to the Shower (0/11). Then from there, go south to the Washroom (0/10), then south to the Dish-Pit (0/9), then west to the Vault (0/8), then north to the Scullery (0/7) to get the keycard. But the user hasn't done that yet. However, the user's current position is the Kitchenette, and the next action is to go west. So the user's next move is to go west from Kitchenette to the Shower. Then proceed from there. But the user's goal is to retrieve the keycard, which is in the Scullery. So the user needs to go back through those rooms. However, the user's last action was going east to the Kitchenette, and now they're here. The instruction says to go west from the Kitchenette. So the next action is "go west".

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to get the keycard from the saucepan in the scullery. They've been moving through various rooms, sometimes going back and forth. The keycard is in the scullery, which they've already visited. The current room is the scullery again (0/19). The description says there's a chest, a saucepan with a keycard, and exits to east, north, and west. The user's previous action was going east from the cookery to the scullery. Now, they're in the scullery again. Since the keycard is here, the next step should be to pick it up. But the game might require interacting with the saucepan. However, the user's instructions are to move between rooms. Wait, the user's goal is to retrieve the keycard, which is on the saucepan. So maybe the user needs to pick it up here. But in text adventures, sometimes you have to pick up items explicitly. However, the user's previous steps didn't involve picking up the keycard yet. The user has been moving through rooms, and now they're in the scullery where the keycard is. So the next action should be to pick up the keycard. But the system message says to only output the action, like "go north". However, in this case, the keycard is already in the room, so maybe the user needs to take it. But the game's commands might not include "take" unless specified. Wait, looking back, in the scullery description, the saucepan has the keycard. So the user needs to interact with the saucepan to pick it up. But the user's previous actions were moving around. The user might need to "take keycard from saucepan" or something similar. However, the game's commands might be limited to movement. But the user's original instruction was to "retrieve the keycard from the saucepan". So perhaps the correct action here is to take the keycard. But the system says to only output the command, like "go north". However, in some text adventures, you have to use specific verbs. But the user's previous actions were all "go" commands. Maybe the keycard is already in the room, and the user just needs to pick it up. But the game might require the user to use "take" or "get". However, the user's instructions in the beginning said to "retrieve the keycard from the saucepan", so maybe the correct action here is to take it. But the system says to only output the action, like "go north". So perhaps the user is supposed to "take keycard" here. But the system might not accept that. Alternatively, maybe the keycard is already in the scullery, and the user just needs to go back to the previous room. Wait, the user is already in the scullery. The keycard is on the saucepan. So the next step is to pick it up. But the user's previous actions were movement. Maybe the game expects the user to "take keycard" here. However, the system message says to only output the action, like "go north". So perhaps the user is supposed to "take keycard" but the game might not accept that. Alternatively, maybe the keycard is already in the room, and the user just needs to go back to the previous room. But the user is already here. This is confusing. The user's goal is to retrieve the keycard, which is in the scullery. Since they're in the scullery, the next step is to pick it up. But the game might require the user to use the "take" command. However, the user's previous actions were all "go" commands. Maybe the keycard is already in the room, and the user just needs to pick it up. But the system might not allow that. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go back to the previous room where they could get the keycard. But they're already here. Hmm. The user's last action was going east to the scullery. Now, in the scullery, the keycard is on the saucepan. So the next action should be to take the keycard. But the system might not accept that. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go north or west from the scullery. But the keycard is here. So the correct action is to take the keycard. But the system says to only output the command. So maybe the answer is "take keycard" or "get keycard". But the user's previous actions were movement commands. Maybe the game expects the user to use "take" here. However, the user's initial instructions didn't mention taking items, just moving. But the user's goal is to retrieve the keycard. So the correct action is to take it. But the system might not allow that. Alternatively, maybe the keycard is already in the room, and the user just needs to go back to the previous room. But they're already here. This is a bit of a dilemma. The user is in the scullery, and the keycard is on the saucepan. The next step is to pick it up. So the answer should be "take keycard" or "get keycard". But the system says to only output the action, like "go north". So maybe the correct answer is "take keycard".
