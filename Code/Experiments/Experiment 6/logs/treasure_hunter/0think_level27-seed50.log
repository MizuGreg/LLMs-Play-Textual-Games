Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First step, go to the south. Following that, move south. If you can succeed at that, make an attempt to move east. And then, attempt to travel north. With that done, travel east. Following that, make an effort to go to the east. And then, move north. That done, go north. And then, head north. Then, head west. With that done, ensure that the gateway is open. Once you have pulled open the gateway, try to go west. Then, make an effort to go west. With that done, pick up the licorice strip from the floor of the studio. And if you do that, you're the winner!
