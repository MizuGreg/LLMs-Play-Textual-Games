Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. Your first objective is to attempt to venture north. Then, make an attempt to move west. Okay, and then, make an effort to move west. Then, take a trip south. Then, go east. That done, move south. Once you do that, travel west. With that over with, pick up the key from the floor of the chamber. Got that? Good!

You've entered a salon.

You smell a terrible smell, and follow it to a box. What a letdown! The box is empty! You see a locked portmanteau.

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Canteen =-
I never took you for the sort of person who would show up in a canteen, but I guess I was wrong.

You can see a shelf. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unblocked exit to the west.
