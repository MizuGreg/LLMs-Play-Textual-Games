Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First step, move east. With that over with, ensure that the hatch is open. Once you have opened the hatch, make an attempt to take a trip east. And then, go east. And then, ensure that the gate is open. And then, travel north. That done, make an attempt to go west. Then, venture north. Next, head north. Then, pick-up the loaf of bread from the floor of the launderette. That's it!

-= Sauna =-
You've entered a sauna.

You can make out a safe. Hmmm... what else, what else? The safe is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! Oh, great. Here's a board. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in this text-based game. They started in the sauna, went east to the garage, opened the hatch, and then went east again to the salon. Now they're in the salon, and the next step was to open the gate, but they couldn't find a gate. The user is asking if they're on the right track and what their next move should be.

First, I need to recall the original instructions. The user was told to move east, open the hatch, go east again, open the gate, travel north, then go west, north again, and pick up the bread. But in the current scenario, after going east from the garage, they're in the salon. The salon has a trunk, a bench, a fondue, an open hatch west, and an open door east. The user tried to open a gate but couldn't. Maybe the "gate" mentioned was a misdirection, or perhaps there's another way to proceed.

Looking at the current environment, the salon has an open door leading east. The user might need to go east from here. The original plan was after opening the gate (which might not be present here), to travel north. But since the user is in the salon, maybe the next step is to check the trunk or the fondue. However, the original goal was to pick up bread from the launderette, which might be in a different location.

Wait, the user's original instructions mentioned a launderette. But in the current location (salon), there's a fondue on the floor. Maybe the bread is in another area. The user needs to follow the steps carefully. The next action after the salon might be to go east through the open door, but the user was supposed to go north after opening the gate. Since the gate isn't here, perhaps the user needs to check other objects. Alternatively, maybe the "gate" was a mistake, and the correct action is to go east through the door.

But the user's last action was trying to open a gate, which didn't work. The next step might be to go east through the open door. The user might have confused the hatch and the gate. The original steps said to open the hatch, then go east, then open the gate. But in the salon, there's an open door east. Maybe that's the correct direction. Alternatively, the user might need to check the trunk or the bench for something. However, the original goal was to pick up bread from the launderette, which might be in a different location. The user needs to proceed step by step, ensuring they follow the correct sequence. Since the user is in the salon, the next logical step might be to go east through the open door, even if it's not a gate. The user might have misread the instructions, so the correct action here is to go east.

<think>
Okay, let's recap the user's journey so far. They started in the sauna, moved east to the garage, opened the hatch, and went east again to the salon. Then they tried to open a gate but couldn't, so they went east through the door into the study. They opened the gate there, went north to the chamber, then west to the playroom, north to the basement, and back south to the playroom again.

The original goal was to pick up a loaf of bread from the launderette. So far, the user hasn't mentioned encountering a launderette or bread. The current location is the playroom, and the next step might be to check if there's a launderette here or nearby. The playroom might not have it, so they need to explore other directions. The user was told to go west after certain steps, but maybe they need to check other rooms. The next possible direction is east, as the playroom has an unguarded entranceway east. Alternatively, the basement might have the launderette. But since the user is in the playroom, the next action should be to go east to check if the launderette is there. If not, maybe proceed north from the playroom. But according to the original instructions, after going north in the basement, they should have gone west. However, the user is back in the playroom. Maybe the launderette is in the basement or another room. The user needs to continue exploring until they find the bread. The next step is to go east from the playroom.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Playroom again after going west from the Chamber. The original goal was to pick up bread from the launderette. So far, they've gone through several rooms but haven't found the launderette yet. The Playroom description mentions an exit to the north, which is unblocked. Maybe the launderette is in a different room, like the Basement or another area. The user needs to continue exploring. Since they've been going back and forth between Playroom and Chamber, perhaps the next step is to go north from the Playroom. Alternatively, maybe the bread is in the Chamber's desk, but the desk is described as empty. The user might need to check other rooms or follow the original steps again. The next action should be to go north from the Playroom to check the next area.

Okay, the user has been stuck in a loop between the Playroom and Chamber. They keep going east and west, but haven't found the launderette or the bread. The original goal was to pick up bread from the launderette, but the user hasn't encountered it yet. The Chamber has a desk, but it's described as empty. Maybe the bread is in the Basement or another room. The user needs to try a different approach. Since the Playroom has an exit to the north, maybe they should go north from the Playroom instead of east. Alternatively, the launderette might be in the Basement. The user should try going north from the Playroom to check the next area. That's the next logical step after repeated attempts in the Playroom and Chamber.

Okay, the user has been cycling between the Playroom and Chamber multiple times, going east and west repeatedly. The original goal was to pick up bread from the launderette, but so far, the user hasn't found it. The Chamber has a desk, but it's described as empty. The Playroom has an exit to the north, which the user hasn't explored yet. Maybe the launderette is in a different room, like the Bar or Basement. The user needs to try going north from the Playroom to check the next area. That's the next logical step after repeated attempts in the Playroom and Chamber.

You arrive in a playroom. You begin to take stock of what's here.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Chamber =-
You've just sauntered into a chamber.

You can see a desk. The desk is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open gate leading south. There is an open portal leading north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.
