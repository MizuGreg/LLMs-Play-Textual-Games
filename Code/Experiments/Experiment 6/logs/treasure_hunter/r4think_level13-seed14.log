I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! First of all, take a trip west. Then, travel north. With that done, travel east. And then, take the butterfly from the box. Alright, thanks!

-= Cellar =-
You are in a cellar. A normal one.



There is an open portal leading south. There is an open passageway leading west.

>                                                                                                                                -= Cellar =-0/1

-= Office =-
You find yourself in an usual kind of place. That is to say, you're in an office.

You can see a desk. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

There is an open passageway leading east. There is an open gateway leading north.

-= Chamber =-
You find yourself in a chamber. An ordinary one.



There is an open gateway leading south. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked.



>                                                                                                                                -= Chamber =-0/3

-= Workshop =-
You've just shown up in a workshop.

You can see a box. The box contains a butterfly. You make out a locker. You can see a portmanteau.

You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.



>                                                                                                                                -= Workshop =-0/4
Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me think through this. The user has been moving through different rooms in TextWorld: from the Cellar, then the Office, Chamber, and now the Workshop. The goal mentioned earlier was to take the butterfly from the box. In the Workshop, there's a box with a butterfly, a locker, and a portmanteau. The user's last action was going east to reach the Workshop. Now, the next step is to take the butterfly from the box. The prompt says to take the butterfly from the box, so the next command should be to pick it up. But I need to check if the game allows that. The description says the box contains a butterfly, so the correct action is to take the butterfly. The user hasn't done that yet, so the next step is to take it.
</think>take the butterfly from the box
