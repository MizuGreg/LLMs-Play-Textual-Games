Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. Your first objective is to go to the east. With that done, attempt to go to the north. Then, make an effort to go to the east. And then, lift the sponge from the floor of the sauna. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Office =-
You arrive in an office. An usual kind of place. You start to take note of what's in the room.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded.

>                                                                                                                                -= Office =-0/1
AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go east
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Studio =-
You find yourself in a studio. An usual one.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.



>                                                                                                                                -= Studio =-0/2
AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go north
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unblocked exit to the south.



>                                                                                                                                -= Kitchen =-0/3
Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, let me think through this. The user is in a text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and complete specific tasks. The original goal was to go east, then north, then east again, and finally lift the sponge in the sauna.

So far, they've been in the Office, then the Studio, and now the Kitchen. The current room is the Kitchen. The user is asking if they're on the right track and if they're close to the goal. 

Looking at the rooms they've passed through: Office (1), Studio (2), Kitchen (3). The next steps mentioned in the Kitchen description are going east, north, or south. The original plan was to go east, then north, then east again. But in the Studio, they went north to the Kitchen. Now, from the Kitchen, they need to go east to continue towards the sauna. 

Wait, the original plan was after going east from the Office, then north from the Studio, then east again. But the Kitchen is the third room. The next step would be to go east from the Kitchen to reach the sauna. But the user is asking if they're close. 

However, the task also includes lifting the sponge from the sauna. So they need to reach the sauna first. The current room is the Kitchen. The directions from the Kitchen are east, north, or south. The user needs to go east to proceed towards the sauna. 

So the next action should be to go east from the Kitchen. That would take them to the next room, which might be the sauna. Then, once there, they can lift the sponge. 

But the user is asking if they're close. Since they've already done the first two steps (east from Office, north from Studio), and now they're in the Kitchen, the next step is east again. So yes, they're on the right track. The next action is go east.

-= Sauna =-
You've just shown up in a sauna.



There is an unguarded exit to the west.

There is a sponge on the floor.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to lift the sponge in the sauna, but the game isn't recognizing the command. They've tried "lift sponge" multiple times, but it's not working. Maybe the correct command is "pick up sponge" or "take sponge"? But the game's response says "That's not a verb I recognise," so perhaps the correct syntax is different.

Wait, in text adventures, sometimes you have to use specific verbs. The user has already gone through the required rooms: Office -> Studio -> Kitchen -> Sauna. The original goal was to go east, then north, then east again, then lift the sponge. They're in the sauna now, so the next step is to pick up the sponge. But the game isn't accepting "lift the sponge." Maybe the correct verb is "take" instead of "lift"? Let me check the previous interactions. The user tried "lift sponge" and it didn't work. Maybe the correct command is "take sponge" or "get sponge"?

Alternatively, maybe the sponge is on the floor, so the correct action is "pick up sponge" or "pick sponge". But the game's error message says it's not recognizing the verb. Perhaps the game expects "take" as the verb. Let me think. In many text adventures, "take" is the standard verb for picking up items. So maybe the correct command is "take sponge".

But the user has tried "lift the sponge" and it's not working. The game might be case-sensitive or expecting a different phrasing. Maybe "pick up the sponge"? But the user's previous attempts were "lift the sponge" and "lift the sponge" again. Wait, the user's last attempt was "lift the sponge" again, and the game still says it's not recognized. So perhaps the correct verb is "take" instead of "lift". Let me try that. The next action should be "take sponge" or "take the sponge".

But the user is supposed to only output the command. So the correct next step is to use the correct verb. Since "lift" isn't working, maybe "take" is the right verb. So the next action is "take sponge".
