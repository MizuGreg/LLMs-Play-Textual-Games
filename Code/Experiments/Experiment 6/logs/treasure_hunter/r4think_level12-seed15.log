Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First thing I need you to do is to make an effort to travel south. If you can do that, attempt to go east. Then, retrieve the sandwich from the floor of the shower. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Lounge =-
Fancy seeing you here. Here, by the way, being the lounge. Let's see what's in here.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a bar. The bar is ordinary. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a couch. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The couch is typical. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You think about smashing the couch to bits, throwing the bits in the dump, etc, until you get bored. Look over there! a desk! Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is an unguarded exit to the east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

Ah, the workshop. This is some kind of workshop, really great standard vibes in this place, a wonderful standard atmosphere. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

You can see an opened safe. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You make out a stand. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in a TextWorld game, and they've been moving between the Lounge and Workshop. The task is to travel south first, then east, retrieve the sandwich from the shower, and then stop.

So far, the user has gone south, then north, then south again, and back to the Lounge. The current location is the Lounge again. The problem is that the sandwich is in the shower, which hasn't been mentioned yet. The user hasn't found the shower room. 

Looking at the descriptions, the Lounge has a bar, a couch, and a desk. The Workshop has a safe and a stand. The exits are east, north, and south. The user needs to find the shower. Maybe the shower is in a different room that's not listed yet. But according to the current descriptions, the user hasn't encountered a shower. 

Wait, the original task says to retrieve the sandwich from the floor of the shower. So the user must find the shower room. But in the current locations (Lounge and Workshop), there's no mention of a shower. Maybe the shower is in a room that's accessible via the current exits. The user has tried going south, north, and east. The Workshop has an exit to the east, but the Lounge has an exit to the east as well. Maybe the shower is in a room that's east of the Lounge or Workshop. 

But the user hasn't tried going east yet. Wait, in the first step, the user was told to first travel south, then east. So after going south to the Workshop, they should try going east. But in the Workshop, the exit to the east is unguarded. So maybe the user needs to go east from the Workshop. However, in the previous steps, the user went back and forth between Lounge and Workshop. 

Wait, the user's last action was going north again, which brought them back to the Lounge. So the next step should be to try going east from the Lounge, as per the initial instruction. The Lounge has an unguarded exit to the east. So maybe going east from the Lounge is the next step. But the user hasn't done that yet. 

Alternatively, maybe the shower is in the Workshop. But the Workshop's description doesn't mention a shower. The user needs to find the sandwich in the shower. Since the user hasn't found the shower yet, they need to explore more. 

So the next logical step is to go east from the Lounge, as that's the next part of the initial plan. The user should try going east to see if that leads to the shower. So the next action should be "go east".

You're now in the bedchamber. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?



There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the south. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the south. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Pantry room. The task is to retrieve the sandwich from the shower. So far, they've been moving between rooms, but haven't found the shower yet. The current rooms they've visited are Lounge, Workshop, Bedchamber, and now Pantry. The exits here are east, south, and west.

The user's goal is to get the sandwich from the shower. The shower hasn't been mentioned in any of the room descriptions so far. The Pantry has a rack but nothing on it. The exits are unguarded, so they can move around freely. Maybe the shower is in one of the adjacent rooms. The next step would be to check the east exit, as that's the next unexplored direction. Alternatively, maybe the shower is in the west or south. But since the user has been moving in a loop between rooms, perhaps they need to explore east first. The Pantry's east exit is unguarded, so going east might lead to the shower. Let's try that.
