You are now playing a profound game of TextWorld! First of all, you could, like, attempt to travel east. After that, try to go to the south. Then, go to the south. Next, pick-up the stick of butter from the floor of the launderette. Got that? Good!

-= Spare Room =-
Guess what, you are in a place we're calling a spare room.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

There is an apple on the floor.
