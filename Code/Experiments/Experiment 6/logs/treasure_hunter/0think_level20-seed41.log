Welcome to another exciting session of TextWorld! First thing I need you to do is to go to the north. After that, go east. Then, attempt to go to the east. And then, head south. After that, make sure that the hatch is ajar. And then, try to go to the south. With that accomplished, attempt to go west. And then, open the gateway. And then, venture west. After that, recover the latchkey from the floor of the bedroom. And if you do that, you're the winner!
