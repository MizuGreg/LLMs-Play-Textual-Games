You are now playing a fast paced game of TextWorld! First of all, you could, like, travel north. And then, make an effort to go west. And then, retrieve the passkey from the floor of the bar. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Canteen =-
Well, here we are in the canteen.



There is an unguarded exit to the north. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

There is a cauliflower on the floor.

-= Closet =-
You are in an usual kind of place. That is to say, you're in a closet. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.



You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Bar =-
You are in a bar. A normal one.



There is an unblocked exit to the east. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

There is a passkey on the floor.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

<think>
Okay, let me think through this. The user is in the Bar, and they need to retrieve the passkey from the floor. The previous steps were going north from the Canteen to the Closet, then west to the Bar. Now, in the Bar, the passkey is on the floor. The user's goal is to get the passkey, so the next logical step is to pick it up.

The current location is the Bar, and the passkey is on the floor. The command should be to take the passkey. But wait, in TextWorld, sometimes you need to use specific verbs like 'take' or 'get'. The user has been using 'go' commands so far, so maybe 'take passkey' is the right action here. Let me check the previous interactions. The user was told to "retrieve the passkey from the floor of the bar." So the correct command would be 'take passkey' or 'get passkey'. Since the user has been using 'go' commands, maybe 'take' is the right verb here. But I need to make sure. The game's responses might expect 'take' or 'get'. Let me confirm. In TextWorld, the standard command is 'take' for picking up items. So the next action should be 'take passkey'.
