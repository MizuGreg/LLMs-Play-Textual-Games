You are now playing a fast paced session of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, you could, like, ensure that the hatch within the cellar is open. After that, move south. Then, ensure that the portal within the basement is open. After that, head south. And then, move west. With that done, attempt to move north. And then, go to the west. Once you get around to doing that, pick up the peanut from the floor of the studio. Alright, thanks!
