Welcome to another fast paced episode of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, you could, like, take a trip north. Then, travel west. With that done, travel north. And then, make an effort to move east. With that done, recover the butterfly from the box within the workshop. Alright, thanks!

You've entered a laundromat.

You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a rack. The rack is typical. But the thing is empty.

There is an open portal leading north. There is an open gate leading south.

>                                                                                                                                -= Workshop =-0/5
