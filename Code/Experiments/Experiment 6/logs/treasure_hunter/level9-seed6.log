You are now playing a life changing round of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First, it would be fantastic if you could travel north. With that over with, venture west. Then, travel south. Then, go west. Then, pick-up the cucumber from the floor of the basement. Got that? Good!

-= Kitchenette =-
You arrive in a kitchenette.



There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

-= Lounge =-
You are in an ordinary kind of place. That is to say, you're in a lounge.



There is an unblocked exit to the south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing a text-based game and has followed some directions. They started in the Kitchenette, went north to the Lounge. Now they're in the Lounge, which has exits to the south and west. The original instructions were to go north, then west, then south, then west again, and pick up the cucumber in the basement.

Wait, the user's current location is the Lounge. The next step in the original plan was to venture west from the Kitchenette, but after going north to the Lounge, the next step according to the initial instructions was to travel south. But the user is now in the Lounge, and the exits are south and west. The original plan said after going north (from Kitchenette to Lounge), then west, then south, then west. But maybe the user needs to check the path again.

Wait, the initial instructions were: go north (from Kitchenette to Lounge), then west, then south, then west. But in the Lounge, the exits are south and west. So maybe the next step is to go west from the Lounge. But the user's next action would be to go west. However, the user is asking if they're making the right moves and if they're close to the goal. The user's current position is Lounge, and the next step according to the original plan was to go west from the Kitchenette, but they've already gone north. Maybe the user is confused about the path.

Alternatively, maybe the original plan was to go north (Kitchenette to Lounge), then west (from Lounge to another room?), then south, then west. But the user is now in the Lounge, so the next step would be to go west. But the user is asking if they're on the right track. The user's next action should be to go west from the Lounge. But the user's current position is Lounge, and the exit to the west is unguarded. So the correct next step is to go west. The user's next command should be "go west".

-= Cookhouse =-
You find yourself in a cookhouse. An ordinary kind of place.



There is an unguarded exit to the east. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

There is a butterfly on the floor.


>                                                                                                                                -= Cookhouse =-0/3

Okay, let's see. The user is playing a text-based game and has followed certain directions. The original goal was to travel north, then west, then south, then west again, and pick up the cucumber from the basement. So far, the user has gone north from the kitchenette to the lounge, then west to the cookhouse. Now, in the cookhouse, there's an exit to the east and south, and a butterfly on the floor.

The next step according to the initial instructions was to go south after going west. But in the cookhouse, the user is at the cookhouse. The exits are east and south. So the next action should be to go south. But wait, the user's previous steps were: north, west, then the current location is cookhouse. The original plan was after going west (from kitchenette to lounge to cookhouse?), but the initial instructions said after going west (from the kitchenette, which was the first step), then travel south, then go west again. Wait, maybe I need to retrace.

Original instructions: First, travel north. Then venture west. Then travel south. Then go west. Then pick-up the cucumber from the basement.

So the sequence is: North -> West -> South -> West -> pick up cucumber.

So after the first north (from kitchenette to lounge), then west (from lounge to cookhouse?), then south (from cookhouse to where? Maybe basement?), then west again. But in the current location, the user is in the cookhouse. So after going west from the lounge (which was the second step), they are now in the cookhouse. Then the next step is to travel south from the cookhouse. So the next action should be south. Then, after going south, the next step is to go west again. But the user is in the cookhouse now. So the next command is to go south. Let me check the current location: Cookhouse has an exit to the south. So the next action is south. Then, after going south, they would be in the basement (assuming that's where the cucumber is). Then go west again to pick up the cucumber. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next step is to go south from the cookhouse.
</think>go south

-= Sauna =-
You've just sauntered into a sauna.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.



>                                                                                                                                -= Sauna =-0/4

Okay, let's see. The user is playing a text-based game where they have to follow specific directions to reach a goal. The original instructions were to go north, then west, then south, then west again, and pick up the cucumber in the basement.

So far, the user has moved from the Kitchenette to the Lounge, then to the Cookhouse, and now to the Sauna. The current location is the Sauna, and the exits are east, north, and west. The next step according to the original plan was to go west after moving south. But in the Sauna, the user is told that the west entrance is unguarded, so maybe that's the direction to go next. 

Wait, the user's previous action was going south from the Cookhouse to the Sauna. Now, in the Sauna, the next step in the original plan wasn't specified, but the user needs to continue following the path. The original steps after moving south were to go west again. But in the Sauna, the west exit is available. So the next action should be to go west. That would take them to the next room, possibly the basement where the cucumber is located. 

The user needs to make sure they're following the correct path. The Sauna's west exit is unguarded, so it's safe to go there. The goal is to pick up the cucumber in the basement, so moving west from the Sauna is the right move. The next command should be "go west".

-= Basement =-
You've come into a typical room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be typical. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the basement. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked.

There is a cucumber on the floor.


>                                                                                                                                -= Basement =-0/5

Okay, let's see. The user is playing a text adventure game. The goal mentioned earlier was to pick up the cucumber from the basement. So far, the player has navigated through the Kitchenette, Lounge, Cookhouse, Sauna, and now the Basement. In the Basement, there's a cucumber on the floor.

The user's next action should be to pick up the cucumber. But the game's commands might require using a specific verb like "take" or "pick up". Since the previous actions were movement commands like "go north" or "go west", the next step is to interact with the cucumber. The correct command here would be "take cucumber" or "pick up cucumber". However, the game might expect the exact phrasing. Looking at the previous interactions, the user was told to "pick-up the cucumber from the floor of the basement." So the correct command is likely "take cucumber" or "pick up cucumber". But in text adventures, sometimes "take" is the verb used. Let me check the previous messages. The user was instructed to "pick-up the cucumber", so maybe the exact command is "take cucumber". But the user's previous actions were movement commands. Wait, in the basement description, it says "There is a cucumber on the floor." So the correct action is to pick it up. The game might require "take cucumber" or "pick up cucumber". Since the user's instruction was to "pick-up the cucumber", the correct command is "take cucumber". But I need to make sure. In many text adventures, "take" is the verb. So the answer should be "take cucumber".
</think>take cucumber
