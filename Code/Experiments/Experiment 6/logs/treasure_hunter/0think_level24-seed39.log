Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First thing I need you to do is to venture east. Okay, and then, take a trip east. Next, make an effort to move east. And then, make an attempt to travel east. After that, try to take a trip south. That done, make an attempt to go south. After that, go south. And then, head west. Okay, and then, pick-up the sandwich from the floor of the closet. That's it!

Hey, want to see a bed? Look over there, a bed. However, the bed, like an empty bed, has nothing on it.
