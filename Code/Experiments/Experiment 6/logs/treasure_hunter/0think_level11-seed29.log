Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First stop, go west. And then, take the keycard from the counter inside the sauna. Got that? Good!

-= Cellar =-
You are in a cellar. A standard one.

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a chest. You smell a wretched smell, and follow it to a stand. You shudder, but continue examining the stand. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You smell a sickening smell, and follow it to a table. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing hasn't got anything on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a shelf. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. However, the shelf, like an empty shelf, has nothing on it.

There is an open hatch leading east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

-= Sauna =-
You've seen better saunas, but at least this one seems pretty typical. The room is well lit.

You can see a counter. The counter is ordinary. On the counter you can make out a keycard.

There is an unguarded exit to the east.
