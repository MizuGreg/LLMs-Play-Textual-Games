Welcome to TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First thing I need you to do is to open the hatch. And then, make an effort to head west. If you can do that, attempt to head north. With that accomplished, open the passageway inside the sauna. After that, make an effort to go north. With that over with, assure that the walnut gate in the bathroom is ajar. Then, travel west. Then, attempt to move south. With that done, recover the latchkey from the floor of the closet. That's it!

-= Cubicle =-
You've just walked into a cubicle.

You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table! The table is ordinary. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. Hm. Oh well You see a bookshelf. The bookshelf is normal. However, the bookshelf, like an empty bookshelf, has nothing on it.

There is a closed hatch leading west. There is an open portal leading south.

You have walked into the most typical of all possible studys.

You can see a box.

There is an open hatch leading east. There is an open gateway leading north.

Okay, let me try to figure out what the next step should be here. The user is in the Study environment. The original task was to open the hatch, go west, then north, open the passageway in the sauna, go north again, ensure the walnut gate in the bathroom is open, travel west, move south, and finally retrieve the latchkey from the closet.

So far, the user has opened the hatch (which was closed west of the cubicle), gone west into the Study. Now, in the Study, there's an open hatch leading east and an open gateway leading north. The next steps according to the task are after opening the hatch and going west, then attempt to go north. Wait, the initial instructions said after opening the hatch and going west, attempt to go north. But in the current location (Study), there's an open gateway north. So maybe the next step is to go north from here. But let me check the task again.

Original task steps: After opening the hatch (done), go west (done), then attempt to go north. So from the Study, going north is the next step. Then, after that, open the passageway inside the sauna. But first, need to go north from Study. So the next action should be 'go north' here. The user is in the Study, and the gateway north is open. So the correct next command is 'go north'.
</think>go north

-= Sauna =-
You arrive in a sauna. A typical kind of place.



There is a closed passageway leading north. There is an open gateway leading south.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Sauna area. The original goal was to open the hatch, go west, then north, open the passageway in the sauna, go north again, ensure the walnut gate in the bathroom is open, travel west, move south, and retrieve the latchkey from the closet.

So far, they've opened the hatch (west of cubicle), gone west to Study, gone north to Sauna, and opened the passageway there. The next step according to the task was after opening the passageway in the sauna, attempt to go north. So in the Sauna, there's a closed passageway north and an open gateway south. Since they just opened the passageway, maybe that's the next step. Wait, the task said after opening the passageway inside the sauna, then attempt to go north. So after opening the passageway, they need to go north. But in the current Sauna, the passageway north is now open (since they just opened it). So the next action should be 'go north' from the Sauna. That makes sense. So the next command is 'go north'.

-= Bathroom =-
You've come into a typical room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be typical. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the bathroom.

You make out a cabinet. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a drawer. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a trunk.

There is an open passageway leading south. There is a closed walnut gate leading west.

There is an open walnut gate leading east. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Office now. The original goal was to travel west, then attempt to move south after ensuring the walnut gate in the bathroom is open. So far, they've opened the walnut gate in the bathroom, gone west into the Office, and now they need to move south from the Office. The next step according to the task is after going west from the bathroom, travel west again? Wait, let me check the original steps again.

Original steps: After ensuring the walnut gate in the bathroom is ajar, then travel west. Then, attempt to move south. So after opening the walnut gate (done), they went west into the Office. Now, from the Office, the next step is to move south. The Office has an open passageway south. So the next action should be 'go south'.

-= Closet =-
You find yourself in a closet. An ordinary one. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You see a stand. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north.

There is a latchkey on the floor.
