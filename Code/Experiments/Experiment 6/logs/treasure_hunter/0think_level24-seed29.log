Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First, it would be a great idea if you could make an effort to head west. And then, open the gateway. After that, go to the north. With that done, make it so that the wooden portal inside the study is wide open. After that, move west. After that, look and see that the passageway within the cookhouse is opened. And then, venture west. Next, travel west. Following that, take the latchkey from the case. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Sauna =-
You've entered a sauna. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

You're now in a scullery. Let's see what's in here.

You can see a plate. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to a table. The table is standard. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open passageway leading east. There is an open portal leading south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

You are in a cookhouse. An ordinary kind of place. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You can see an opened chest in the room. The chest is empty, what a horrible day! Look over there! a pan. The pan is ordinary. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is an open wooden portal leading east. There is an open passageway leading west.

-= Cookhouse =-
You are in a cookhouse. An ordinary kind of place. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You can see an opened chest in the room. The chest is empty, what a horrible day! Look over there! a pan. The pan is ordinary. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is an open wooden portal leading east. There is an open passageway leading west.

-= Scullery =-
You're now in a scullery. Let's see what's in here.

You can see a plate. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to a table. The table is standard. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open passageway leading east. There is an open portal leading south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.
