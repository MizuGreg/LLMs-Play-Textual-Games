You arrive in a dish-pit. An usual kind of place. You begin looking for stuff.

You can see an opened refrigerator right there by you. The refrigerator is empty, what a horrible day! You can see a locked case in the room. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a bowl. However, the bowl, like an empty bowl, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You can see a shelf. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in a TextWorld game where they need to navigate through different rooms and find a frisbee in a closet to win. The current room is the Kitchen, and they've been moving between the Kitchen and Dish-Pit by going north and south. The instructions mentioned going north, then east, then south, etc., but so far the user has only been moving between those two rooms.

Looking at the current room description, the Kitchen has a locked freezer, an unblocked exit to the east, and a south exit. The Dish-Pit has a refrigerator, a locked case, a bowl, and a shelf, with exits to east and south. The user's previous actions have been going back and forth between these two rooms, but they haven't explored the east exit yet. The original plan was to go east after moving north, then east again, then retrieve the frisbee from the closet. 

Wait, the user's initial steps were: go north, then east, then south, then south again, then east, then retrieve the frisbee. But in the current state, they're stuck in a loop between Kitchen and Dish-Pit. The east exit from the Kitchen hasn't been explored yet. Maybe the next step should be to go east from the Kitchen to check that area. The user hasn't tried that yet, so perhaps that's where the frisbee is or leads to the closet. The locked case in the Dish-Pit might be a clue, but the user hasn't interacted with it. However, the main goal is to get to the closet and retrieve the frisbee. So the next logical step is to go east from the Kitchen to explore that direction, which was part of the initial plan. The user needs to break the loop and explore the east exit to proceed further.
