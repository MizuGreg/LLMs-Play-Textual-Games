It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, make an attempt to go to the south. After that, attempt to go east. That done, go south. With that accomplished, lift the bug from the floor of the closet. Alright, thanks!

-= Workshop =-
You are in a workshop. An ordinary one. You can barely contain your excitement.



There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Cookhouse =-
You find yourself in a cookhouse. A standard kind of place. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the north.

-= Vault =-
You find yourself in a vault. A normal one.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the south. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

-= Closet =-
You've entered a closet. Let's see what's in here.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a durian and a bug on the floor.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user has been moving through different rooms: Workshop, Cookhouse, Vault, and now Closet. The goal mentioned was to lift the bug from the floor of the closet. So far, they've gone south three times to get to the closet. Now, in the closet, there's a durian and a bug on the floor.

The next step is to lift the bug. But the prompt says to only output the action. The user is in the Closet, and the bug is on the floor. So the correct action here would be to pick up the bug. But the available commands might be limited. The previous interactions show that the user can move in directions (north, east, south, west), but here, the task is to lift the bug. Since the game's environment is text-based, the command to pick up the bug would be "take bug" or "lift bug". However, the user's previous actions were all movement commands. The instruction says to lift the bug from the floor of the closet. So the correct action here is to pick up the bug. The answer should be "take bug" or "lift bug". But looking at the previous commands, the user used "go south" and "go east", so maybe the correct command here is "take bug". But I need to check if that's the expected action. Since the user is in the Closet, and the bug is on the floor, the action is to pick it up. So the next command should be "take bug".
