Welcome to TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First, it would be a great idea if you could attempt to travel north. And then, pick up the passkey from the floor of the cookery. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Studio =-
This might come as a shock to you, but you've just entered a studio.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Cookery =-
You arrive in a cookery. A normal kind of place. You can barely contain your excitement.



You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a passkey on the floor.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they need to collect a passkey and reach the original goal. So far, they've gone north from the studio into the cookery. The cookery has a passkey on the floor. The user is asking if they're on the right track and what their next move should be.

First, I need to confirm if the current actions are correct. The user was told to go north first, which they did. Then, they need to pick up the passkey from the floor. The next logical step would be to pick up the passkey. But the user is asking if they're close to the goal. Since the passkey is required, collecting it is a key step. After picking it up, maybe they need to go south to exit, but the prompt says once the passkey is picked up, they can stop. So the next action should be to pick up the passkey. The user's next command should be "pick up passkey".
