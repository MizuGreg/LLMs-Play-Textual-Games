You are now playing a exciting game of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First stop, head west. Then, try to move south. Once you get through with that, head east. And then, make an effort to take a trip east. Then, pick up the passkey from the floor of the bar. Got that? Good!

You find yourself in a studio. A typical one. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You make out a locked toolbox nearby. You can make out a closed bureau.

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the south. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text adventure game called TextWorld. The goal seems to be to reach the original goal, which might be something like finding the passkey or getting through certain areas.

The user has already moved west from the studio to the scullery and then back east to the studio. The current location is the studio again. The prompt mentions a locked toolbox and a closed bureau. The exits are north, south, and west. The user's previous actions were "go west" and "go east", which brought them back to the studio.

The user is now asking if they're making the right actions and if they're close to the goal. The next step would be to figure out what's needed. The original instructions mentioned picking up the passkey from the floor of the bar. But in the current studio, there's a locked toolbox and a closed bureau. Maybe the passkey is in the toolbox or the bureau? Or perhaps they need to go through other exits.

The user's next action should be to check the toolbox or the bureau. Since the toolbox is locked, maybe they need a key. But the passkey hasn't been picked up yet. Alternatively, maybe the passkey is in the scullery, but the user hasn't checked there. However, the current location is the studio again. The user might need to explore other exits. The south exit is unguarded, so maybe going south is the next step. But the original instructions said to go south after the first steps. Wait, the initial directions were: first stop, head west. Then move south. Then east. Then take a trip east. Then pick up the passkey from the bar.

Wait, the user is in the studio again. The initial plan was to go west, then south, then east, then pick up the passkey. But after going west to scullery and back east, they're back in studio. Maybe the next step is to go south from the studio. The south exit is unguarded, so that's possible. Alternatively, maybe the passkey is in the bureau or toolbox. But the toolbox is locked. Maybe the user needs to find a key first. But the passkey is supposed to be in the bar. Wait, the original instruction said to pick up the passkey from the floor of the bar. So maybe the user needs to reach the bar, which is probably in the scullery or another area.

But the current location is the studio. The exits are north, south, west. The user needs to get to the bar. Maybe the bar is in the scullery. The scullery has a fridge, a case, etc. But the user hasn't checked the scullery's contents yet. However, the user is back in the studio. The next logical step might be to go south, as per the initial plan. So the next action would be "go south".

You see a bench. The bench is typical. But the thing is empty.

Okay, let's break down the user's journey so far. They started in the Studio, went West to the Scullery, then East back to the Studio. Then they went South to the Laundromat, West to the Chamber, and East back to the Laundromat. The goal was to pick up the passkey from the bar.

In the Chamber, they found a sandwich on the floor. The original plan mentioned going east, then south, then east again, and picking up the passkey from the bar. The user is now in the Laundromat again. The next step might be to check the exits again. The Laundromat has exits to East, North, South, West. The user needs to find the bar, which might be in the Chamber or another area. But the Chamber had a sandwich, not the passkey. Maybe the passkey is in the Studio's toolbox or bureau. But the toolbox is locked. Alternatively, the bar could be in the Laundromat. The user needs to check the exits again. The next action should be to go North from the Laundromat, as that's unblocked. So the next command is "go north".

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Laundromat and the Chamber. They've been moving back and forth between these areas. The original goal was to pick up the passkey from the bar. So far, they've checked the Studio, Scullery, Laundromat, and Chamber. The passkey hasn't been found yet.

In the Chamber, there's a sandwich on the floor. Maybe the passkey is in the Studio's toolbox or bureau. The toolbox is locked, so maybe they need a key. But the user hasn't found a key yet. Alternatively, the bar might be in the Laundromat. The user needs to check the Laundromat again for any clues.

The Laundromat has an unblocked exit to the east, north, south, and west. The user has been going west and east repeatedly. Maybe they need to check the north exit from the Laundromat. The original plan was to go east, then south, then east again. But they're stuck in a loop. Perhaps the next step is to go north from the Laundromat to reach the Studio again, then check the toolbox or bureau for the passkey. Alternatively, maybe the passkey is in the Chamber, but the user hasn't checked there yet. However, the Chamber's description doesn't mention the passkey. The user might need to find another way to unlock the toolbox. But since the passkey is supposed to be in the bar, maybe they need to find the bar first. The bar could be in the Laundromat or another area. The user should try going north from the Laundromat to check the Studio again.

Okay, the user is moving through various rooms in the game, trying to find the passkey. They've been going back and forth between the Studio, Laundromat, Chamber, Cookhouse, Attic, and Scullery. The original goal was to pick up the passkey from the bar. So far, they haven't found it yet.

In the current Attic, there's a trunk that's empty. The user might need to check other areas again. The Scullery had a fridge that's empty and a case. The Cookhouse had a closed chest. The Studio has a locked toolbox and a closed bureau. The Laundromat has a bench. The Chamber has a sandwich. None of these have the passkey.

The user is in the Attic now. The exits are east and south. The next step might be to go east to check the next room, maybe the bar is there. Alternatively, go south back to the Scullery. But the user has been going around in circles. The passkey might be in the Scullery's case or the Cookhouse's chest. The user needs to check those areas again. Since the Scullery is next, going north from the Attic to the Scullery makes sense. But the user is in the Attic, so the next action should be to go east or south. The user previously went north from the Scullery to the Attic. Maybe the passkey is in the Scullery's case. The user should check the Scullery again. So the next action is to go north from the Attic to the Scullery.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Cookhouse and Kitchen. They've been moving back and forth, but haven't found the passkey yet. The original goal was to pick up the passkey from the bar. So far, they've checked the Studio's locked toolbox, the Scullery's fridge, the Laundromat's bench, the Chamber's sandwich, the Cookhouse's chest, and the Kitchen's board. None of these have been the passkey.

The user is in the Cookhouse again. The closed chest in the corner might be where the passkey is. Since the chest is closed, they might need a key to open it. But the passkey is supposed to be in the bar. Maybe the bar is in another area. The user needs to find the bar first. The exits from the Cookhouse are east, south, and west. The user has been going east to the Kitchen and back. The next step is to check the south exit from the Cookhouse to see if that leads to the bar. Alternatively, go west to the Attic again. But the user has been going around in circles. The passkey might be in the Scullery's case or the Cookhouse's chest. The user should check the chest again. Since the chest is closed, maybe they need to open it. But the user hasn't found a key yet. The next action should be to go south from the Cookhouse to check the next area.

<think>
Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Laundromat, Chamber, and Studio. They've been moving back and forth, but haven't found the passkey yet. The original goal was to pick up the passkey from the bar. So far, they've checked the Studio's locked toolbox and closed bureau, the Scullery's fridge, the Laundromat's bench, the Chamber's sandwich, the Cookhouse's chest, and the Kitchen's board. None of these have been the passkey.

The user is in the Laundromat again. The exits are east, north, south, and west. The passkey is supposed to be in the bar, which might be in the Laundromat or another area. The user needs to find the bar. Since they've been going around in circles, maybe the next step is to go north from the Laundromat to the Studio again and check the toolbox or bureau. The toolbox is locked, but maybe the passkey is inside. Alternatively, the bar could be in the Scullery. The user should try going north to the Studio and check the toolbox again.
