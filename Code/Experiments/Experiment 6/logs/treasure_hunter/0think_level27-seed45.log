Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an exciting round of TextWorld? You do! Here is how to play! First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to travel south. Then, pick up the Henderson's limited edition latchkey from the floor of the spare room. After that, attempt to travel north. And then, check that the Henderson's limited edition box inside the vault is unlocked with the Henderson's limited edition latchkey. After that, assure that the Henderson's limited edition box in the vault is opened. After you have opened the Henderson's limited edition box, pick up the type Y key from the Henderson's limited edition box in the vault. Then, check that the type Y door is unlocked with the type Y key. And then, ensure that the type Y door is open. Then, attempt to travel east. And then, doublecheck that the gate is opened. And then, try to go north. And then, make an attempt to venture west. With that done, take a trip north. And then, retrieve the loaf of bread from the board in the washroom. Alright, thanks!

-= Vault =-
You arrive in a vault. A normal kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You scan the room, seeing a Henderson's limited edition box. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on.

There is a closed type Y door leading east. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

-= Spare Room =-
Well, here we are in the spare room. The room is well lit.

What's that over there? It looks like it's a toolbox. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You scan the room for a shelf, and you find a shelf. However, the shelf, like an empty shelf, has nothing on it.

You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a Henderson's limited edition latchkey on the floor.
