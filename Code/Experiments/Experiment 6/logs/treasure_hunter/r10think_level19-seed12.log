It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First thing I need you to do is to travel south. Next, travel west. That done, pick-up the fly larva from the floor of the cookhouse. That's it!

-= Study =-
Of every study you could have walked into, you had to come round an usual one. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You see a locked coffer. You make out a trunk. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You scan the room for a stand, and you find a stand. The stand is typical. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is a closed gate leading west. There is an open gateway leading east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

-= Vault =-
You make a grand eccentric entrance into a vault. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You see a suitcase. You make out a counter. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the counter.

You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and collect items. The goal mentioned was to travel south, then west, and pick up the fly larva from the cookhouse.

Looking at the current scenario, the user is in the Study room again, which seems to be part of a loop. The environment descriptions mention locked coffers, trunks, a stand, and gates leading west and east. The user has been moving between the Study and Vault rooms multiple times, going south and north. 

The task is to pick up the fly larva from the cookhouse. So far, the user hasn't found the cookhouse. The current location is the Study room, which has a closed gate west and an open gateway east. The Vault room has a suitcase and a counter but nothing on it. The user needs to find the cookhouse, which might be accessible through the west gate or another path.

Since the user is stuck in a loop between Study and Vault, maybe they need to explore other exits. The Study room's west gate is closed, but the east gateway is open. However, the user has been going south from Study to Vault and then back. Maybe the cookhouse is in a different direction. Alternatively, perhaps the locked coffer or trunk in the Study room holds the fly larva. But the user hasn't interacted with those yet.

Wait, the original instructions said to pick up the fly larva from the floor of the cookhouse. So the cookhouse must be a separate room. The user needs to find the cookhouse. The Study room's west gate is closed, but maybe after opening it, they can reach the cookhouse. Alternatively, the Vault's west exit might lead to another area. But the Vault's west exit is unguarded, so maybe that's a path.

But the user's current position is in the Study room. The next step would be to check the west gate. However, the Study's west gate is closed. The user might need to find a way to open it. Alternatively, maybe the cookhouse is in the east direction from the Study, but the east gateway leads to the Vault, which doesn't have the cookhouse.

Wait, the initial instructions said to go south, then west. So perhaps after going south to Vault, then west to another room. But the Vault's west exit is unguarded. So maybe the cookhouse is west of the Vault. But the user hasn't checked that yet. However, the user is currently in the Study room again, so maybe they need to go east to Vault again, then west to the cookhouse.

But the user's last action was going north from Vault back to Study. So the next step would be to try the west gate in Study. But it's closed. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to find a key or another way to open the gate. However, the current descriptions don't mention any keys. The locked coffer might be a place to look for a key, but the user hasn't interacted with it yet.

Alternatively, maybe the fly larva is in the Study room's stand, but the stand is empty. Or perhaps in the trunk. But the user hasn't checked those. The original task was to pick up the fly larva from the cookhouse, so the user needs to reach the cookhouse first.

So the correct path would be: Study -> South to Vault -> West to cookhouse. But the user is currently in Study, so the next step is to go south again to Vault, then west. But the user has already done that before. However, the user might need to go east from Study to Vault again, then west. But the user is in Study, so the next action should be to go south to Vault. Then from Vault, go west. But the user's last action was going north, so they are back in Study. Therefore, the next action should be to go south again to Vault, then west to the cookhouse. But the user needs to pick up the fly larva from the cookhouse's floor. So the correct sequence is: Study -> South (Vault) -> West (cookhouse). Then pick up the larva.

But the user is currently in Study, so the next action is to go south to Vault. Then from Vault, go west. But the user has been looping between Study and Vault. So the next step is to go south again.

You make a grand eccentric entrance into a vault. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You see a suitcase. You make out a counter. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the counter.

You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

-= Cookhouse =-
You're now in the cookhouse.

You can make out a locked case, which looks usual, in the room.

There is a closed portal leading north. There is an open hatch leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a fly larva on the floor.
