Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Your task for today is to lift the sandwich from the floor of the laundry place.

-= Laundry Place =-
You are in a laundry place. An ordinary one. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.



You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a sandwich on the floor.
