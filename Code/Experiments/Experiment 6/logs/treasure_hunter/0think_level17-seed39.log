It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First off, doublecheck that the door in the restroom is wide open. After that, attempt to venture east. Then, doublecheck that the passageway in the bedchamber is open. And then, try to venture north. And then, open the gateway inside the kitchenette. After pulling open the gateway, make an attempt to travel east. That done, pick-up the burger from the floor of the cubicle. Alright, thanks!

-= Restroom =-
You are in a restroom. A standard kind of place. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You can make out a safe. The safe is empty! What a waste of a day! You see a dresser. The dresser is empty, what a horrible day!

There is a closed door leading east. There is an unguarded exit to the north. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

-= Closet =-
You have stumbled into the most standard of all possible closets.

You see a case. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stand. The stand appears to be empty. Look over there! a table. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

-= Kitchenette =-
You're now in a kitchenette. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

You make out an opened cabinet. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this?

There is a closed gateway leading east. There is a closed passageway leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.
