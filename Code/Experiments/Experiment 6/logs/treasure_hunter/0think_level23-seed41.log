Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First off, make an effort to move west. And then, make an attempt to venture north. Then, attempt to head west. And then, try to go west. Then, make an effort to head south. If you can get around to doing that, travel south. And then, retrieve the latchkey from the refrigerator. That's it!
