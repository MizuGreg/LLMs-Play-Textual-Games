Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, try to move south. And then, go west. Next, head north. That done, make an attempt to go north. With that done, pick-up the knife from the floor of the cookhouse. That's it!

-= Cookery =-
You find yourself in a cookery. A normal one. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.



You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game called TextWorld. The initial instructions were to move south, then west, then north, and finally pick up a knife in the cookhouse. But the user ended up in the pantry instead.

So, the current location is the pantry. The user has to figure out the next steps. The goal is to pick up the knife from the cookhouse. The user has already moved south from the cookery to the pantry. Now, they need to go west from the pantry. The pantry has an exit to the north and west. The user's next action should be to go west. But wait, the user's previous action was "go south", which took them to the pantry. Now, the next step according to the original instructions was to go west. But the user is asking if they're on the right track and what the next action should be.

The pantry has an exit to the west, which is unguarded. So the user should go west from the pantry. Then, they might reach the cookhouse again. Once there, they can pick up the knife. The user needs to follow the sequence: south, west, north, then pick up the knife. But in the current location, the next step is west. So the correct next action is "go west".

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game where they have to follow a series of directions to reach a goal. The original instructions were to move south, then west, then north, then north again, and finally pick up the knife in the cookhouse.

So far, the user has moved south from the cookery to the pantry, then west to the parlor. Now, they're in the parlor. The next step according to the original instructions was to go north again. But in the current room (parlor), the available exits are east and north. The user's next action should be to go north, as per the original plan. The goal is to reach the cookhouse and pick up the knife, so moving north from the parlor would take them back towards the cookery. Then, after that, they would need to go north again to reach the cookhouse. But since the user is currently in the parlor, the immediate next step is to go north. The answer should be "go north".

This might come as a shock to you, but you've just moved into a shower. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game where they have to navigate through different rooms and eventually pick up a knife from the cookhouse. The original instructions were to move south, then west, then north, then try north again, and finally pick up the knife.

So far, the user has moved south from the cookery to the pantry, then west to the parlor, then north to the shower. Now they're in the shower. The next step according to the original plan was to go north again. But wait, in the shower room, the exits are east, north, and south. The user has already been in the shower, so maybe they need to check if the knife is here or if they need to go back.

But the original goal was to pick up the knife from the cookhouse. However, the user has been moving away from the cookery. Maybe there's a mistake in the path. Let me check the rooms again.

Original path: Cookery (start) → pantry (south) → parlor (west) → shower (north). Now, the next step was to go north again from the cookery, but the user has already moved south. Wait, the original instructions said: first move south, then west, then north. Then, after that, try north again. Then pick up the knife in the cookhouse.

But the user is now in the shower. So maybe they need to backtrack. The shower has an exit to the south, which would take them back to the parlor. Then from the parlor, maybe back to the pantry, then north to the cookery again. But the cookery was the starting point. However, the user's current position is the shower. So perhaps the next step is to go north from the shower, but that might not be the right direction. Alternatively, go south back to the parlor.

But according to the original plan, after moving north from the parlor (which was the third step), the next step was to try going north again. But in the shower, going north would take them to another room. However, the original goal was to pick up the knife in the cookhouse. So maybe the user is supposed to go back to the cookery, then pick up the knife.

But the user is in the shower now. The exits from the shower are east, north, and south. The user needs to get back to the cookery. So perhaps the correct path is to go south from the shower back to the parlor, then east to the pantry, then north to the cookery. Then, in the cookery, pick up the knife.

But the user hasn't picked up the knife yet. The original instructions said to pick it up from the floor of the cookhouse. So the user needs to be in the cookery again. Therefore, the next step should be to go south from the shower to the parlor, then east to the pantry, then north to the cookery. But the user is currently in the shower. The next action should be to go south to the parlor. However, the user's last action was going north to the shower. So the next step would be to go south back to the parlor. Then from there, east to the pantry, then north to the cookery. Then, in the cookery, pick up the knife.

But the user is in the shower. The next step is to go south to the parlor. So the answer should be "go south".

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is navigating through different rooms in this text-based game. The original goal was to pick up the knife from the cookhouse. Let me track their movements so far.

Starting in the cookery, they went south to the pantry, then west to the parlor, north to the shower, and back south to the parlor again. The current location is the parlor (0/5). The user's next action needs to be determined.

Looking at the directions available in the parlor: east is unguarded, north is unguarded. The user has been moving between rooms, but hasn't found the cookhouse yet. The knife is in the cookhouse, which was the starting point. The user needs to get back to the cookhouse to pick up the knife.

Wait, the initial instructions said to go south, then west, then north, then north again. But after going north from the parlor (shower), they went south back to the parlor. Maybe they need to go east from the parlor to reach the cookhouse? Or perhaps the cookhouse is in a different direction. Let me check the previous steps.

Original path: Cookery (start) → pantry (south) → parlor (west) → shower (north) → parlor (south). So the parlor is connected to the shower (north) and east. The cookery was connected to the pantry (south) and possibly other directions. Maybe the cookhouse is in the north from the parlor? But the user hasn't checked that yet. Alternatively, maybe the cookhouse is in the east direction from the parlor.

But the user's goal is to pick up the knife in the cookhouse. Since they are currently in the parlor, they need to find the path back to the cookhouse. The parlor has an exit to the east and north. The north exit leads to the shower, which they came from. The east exit hasn't been explored yet. Maybe going east from the parlor would lead them back towards the cookhouse.

Alternatively, maybe the cookhouse is in the north from the parlor. But when they went north from the parlor, they went to the shower. So perhaps the cookhouse is in the east direction. The user needs to go east from the parlor to reach the cookhouse. So the next action should be 'go east' to proceed towards the cookhouse and pick up the knife.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in this text-based game. The original goal was to pick up the knife from the cookhouse. Let me track their movements so far.

They started in the Cookery, went south to the Pantry, then west to the Parlor, north to the Shower, south back to the Parlor, and east back to the Pantry. Now they're in the Pantry again. The sock is mentioned here, but the knife hasn't been picked up yet. 

The original instructions said after moving north (probably from the Parlor to the Shower), they should pick up the knife from the cookhouse. But the current location is the Pantry. Maybe the cookhouse is a different room. Wait, the first room was the Cookery, which might be the same as the cookhouse. But in the Pantry, there's a sock, not a knife. 

Hmm, maybe the knife is in the Parlor or the Shower? The user hasn't checked those rooms yet. But their last action was going east to the Pantry. They need to find the knife. Since the Pantry doesn't have it, maybe they need to go back to the Parlor, then check other directions. Alternatively, maybe the cookhouse is the Cookery room, and they need to go back there. But the user has been moving between Pantry, Parlor, and Shower. 

Wait, the original instruction said after moving north (from the Parlor to the Shower), then pick up the knife. But the knife is in the cookhouse. Maybe the cookhouse is the Cookery room. But when they first entered Cookery, they went south to Pantry. So maybe they need to go back north to the Cookery to pick up the knife. But in the Cookery, the description didn't mention a knife. The user hasn't checked that room yet. 

Alternatively, maybe the knife is in the Parlor. The user is currently in the Pantry, so they need to go west back to the Parlor. Then check if the knife is there. Or maybe the Shower has the knife? But the Shower's description doesn't mention it. 

Wait, the user's goal was to pick up the knife from the cookhouse. The cookhouse is likely the Cookery room. But when they first entered Cookery, they went south to Pantry. So maybe they need to go back north to the Cookery. But in the current location (Pantry), the exit to the north is the Cookery. So the next step should be to go north back to Cookery, then check if the knife is there. 

But the user's last action was going east to the Pantry. So the next action should be to go north to the Cookery. Then, once there, check if the knife is present. If not, maybe explore other rooms. But according to the original instructions, after moving north (from Parlor to Shower), they should pick up the knife. But maybe the knife is in the Cookery. 

So the correct next step is to go north from the Pantry back to the Cookery. Then check for the knife. If it's there, pick it up. If not, maybe explore other rooms. But based on the initial instructions, the user needs to go north again after the previous steps. So the answer should be to go north.

The user's current location is the Cookery. The original task was to pick up the knife from the cookhouse. Maybe the cookhouse is the same as the Cookery? Or perhaps there's a different room. The user needs to check if the knife is here. But in the current Cookery description, there's no mention of a knife. The previous rooms had a sock in the Pantry.

Okay, the user tried to pick up the knife but the system said that's not a recognized verb. Let me check the previous steps.

The original goal was to pick up the knife from the cookhouse. The user has been moving through different rooms: south, west, north, south, east, north again. Now they're back in the cookery. The knife must be here. But the correct command might not be "pick-up knife". Maybe it's "take knife" or "get knife". The game might expect a specific verb. Since "pick-up" wasn't accepted, perhaps the correct command is "take" or "get". Let me think about the possible commands in TextWorld. Usually, "take" is the verb used for picking up items. So the correct command should be "take knife". Let me confirm that. The user is in the cookery, and the knife is on the floor. So the next action should be "take knife".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to pick up a knife in the Cookery area. They first tried "pick-up knife", which the game didn't recognize. Then they tried "take knife", but the game said they can't see any such thing.

Hmm, maybe the correct command is different. In text adventures, common commands are "take" or "get". But the game might have specific verbs. The user might need to use "get" instead of "take". Alternatively, maybe the knife is in a specific location or has a different name.

Wait, the original instruction said to "pick-up the knife from the floor of the cookhouse." But in the current room (Cookery), maybe the knife isn't visible. Maybe the user needs to look around first. But the game didn't have a "look" command. Or perhaps the knife is in another location, like the pantry or parlor.

Wait, earlier in the pantry, there was a sock on the floor. Maybe the knife is in the pantry? But the user is currently in the Cookery. The user's previous moves were going south, west, north, etc., but maybe they need to check the cookery again. Alternatively, maybe the knife is in the shower or another room.

But the user's goal was to pick up the knife from the cookhouse. Maybe the cookhouse is the Cookery room. But the game says there's no knife there. Maybe the user needs to check other rooms. Wait, the user was told to go south, west, north, then try to go north again, then pick up the knife. But in the Cookery, there's no knife. Maybe the knife is in the pantry? But the pantry has a sock. Or maybe the user needs to check the cookery again for a hidden knife.

Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "get knife" but the game doesn't recognize it. Or perhaps the knife is in a different location. Wait, the user might have missed it. Let me check the previous rooms. In the pantry, there's a sock. In the parlor, maybe? But the user hasn't checked there. Wait, the user's path was Cookery -> Pantry -> Parlor -> Shower -> Parlor -> Pantry -> Cookery. So maybe the knife is in the pantry or parlor. But the user hasn't checked those areas yet. However, the original instruction said to pick up the knife from the cookhouse (Cookery), but maybe the knife is in another room. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to look again in the current room.

But the game says there's no knife in the Cookery. So maybe the user needs to try a different approach. Maybe the correct command is "look" to check the room again, but the game might not have that command. Alternatively, maybe the knife is in the pantry, and the user needs to go back there. But the user is in the Cookery now. So the next step would be to go west or south to reach the pantry again. But the user's previous action was "go north" to get back to Cookery. So perhaps the user needs to go west from Cookery to reach the pantry again, check if the knife is there. But the user hasn't checked the pantry yet. Wait, in the pantry, there's a sock, but no knife. So maybe the knife is in the parlor? But the user hasn't checked there. Alternatively, maybe the knife is in the shower. But the user hasn't checked that either.

Wait, the original instruction said to pick up the knife from the cookhouse. Maybe the cookhouse is the Cookery, but the knife isn't there. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the initial steps. Alternatively, maybe the knife is in the pantry, but the user didn't check there. But the user was in the pantry earlier. Maybe the knife is in the parlor. But the user hasn't checked the parlor. So maybe the user needs to go east from the parlor to check the pantry again, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "get knife" even though the game says it's not there. But the user tried "take knife" and it didn't work. Maybe the game expects a different verb. Or maybe the knife is in a different location. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to look around again. But since the game doesn't have a "look" command, perhaps the user needs to try moving to another room where the knife might be. But the user's goal was to pick up the knife in the cookhouse. So maybe the user needs to check the cookery again. But the game says there's no knife there. So perhaps the user is stuck. But the user needs to proceed. Maybe the next step is to go west from the Cookery to the pantry again, check if the knife is there. But the pantry has a sock. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go south from the Cookery to the shower, but that's not helpful.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in a text-based game. Their goal is to pick up a knife from the cookhouse. So far, they've moved through the pantry, parlor, shower, and back to the cookery. In the cookery, they tried to pick up the knife but got an error. The system said "You can't see any such thing," so maybe the knife isn't in the cookery anymore or isn't visible.

Wait, the user's last action was "go west" which took them back to the shower. Now they're in the shower again. The original instruction was to go south, then west, then north, then attempt to go north again, and then pick up the knife from the cookhouse. But maybe the knife is in a different location. Let me check the previous steps.

In the cookery, the user was told to pick up the knife from the floor of the cookhouse. But when they tried to pick it up, it wasn't there. Maybe they didn't check the right place. Alternatively, maybe the knife is in the pantry or another room. But the user is currently in the shower. They need to find the knife.

Wait, perhaps the knife is in the cookery, but the user didn't look properly. The error message said "You can't see any such thing," so maybe the knife is hidden or requires a different action. But the user can't use "pick-up" or "take" because those commands aren't recognized. Maybe the correct verb is "take" instead of "pick-up." But the user tried "take knife" and it didn't work. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the knife is in the pantry. When the user was in the pantry, there was a sock on the floor. Maybe the knife is in another room. But the user is in the shower now. They need to navigate back to the cookery. The shower has exits to east, north, and south. So maybe they should go north to the parlor again, then east to the pantry, then north to the cookery. But the user is in the shower, so the next step would be to go north to the parlor. Then from there, maybe east to the pantry, then north to the cookery again. But the user might not have checked the cookery again. Alternatively, maybe the knife is in the parlor. But the original instruction was to pick it up in the cookhouse.

Wait, the original goal was to pick up the knife from the floor of the cookhouse. So the user needs to be in the cookery again. The user is in the shower, so they need to go back to the cookery. The shower has an unguarded exit to the north, which is the parlor. Then from the parlor, exit east to the pantry, then north to the cookery. Once in the cookery, they can look for the knife. But the user tried that earlier and couldn't find it. Maybe the knife is there but not visible unless they look. But the game might require the user to check the room again. Alternatively, maybe the knife is in the pantry. But the original instruction says it's in the cookhouse.

So the next step is to go north from the shower to the parlor, then east to the pantry, then north to the cookery again. Then try to pick up the knife. But the user is in the shower now. So the next action should be to go north to the parlor. Then from there, go east to the pantry, then north to the cookery. Once there, check again for the knife. But the user might have missed it before. Alternatively, maybe the knife is in the parlor. But the original instruction says it's in the cookhouse. So the user needs to be in the cookery again. Therefore, the correct next action is to go north from the shower to the parlor, then east to the pantry, then north to the cookery. But the user is in the shower, so the immediate next step is to go north to the parlor. Then proceed from there. So the answer should be "go north" from the shower.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the instructions to pick up the knife. Earlier attempts to "pick-up knife" and "take knife" didn't work. Then they went west and north, ending up in the Cookhouse. Now, in the Cookhouse, there's a knife on the floor. The correct action here would be to pick it up. The previous commands didn't work because maybe the correct verb is "take" instead of "pick-up" or "pick". Let me check the available commands again. The system says "You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south." but there's a knife on the floor. So the right action is to take the knife. The user should use "take knife" again, but maybe the system requires the exact phrase. Wait, the user tried "take knife" before and got "You can't see any such thing." But now in the Cookhouse, the knife is present. Maybe the correct command is "take knife" again. Alternatively, maybe "get knife". But the system might accept "take". Let me try "take knife" again.
