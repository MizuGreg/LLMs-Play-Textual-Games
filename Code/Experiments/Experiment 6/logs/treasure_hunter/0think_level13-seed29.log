Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an life changing round of TextWorld? You do! Here is your task for today. First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to try to go to the north. Then, move west. After that, head west. Following that, recover the keycard from the counter inside the sauna. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Workshop =-
You arrive in a normal kind of place. That is to say, you're in a workshop. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."

As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a bureau. Classic TextWorld. You can make out an armchair. The armchair appears to be empty.

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. There is an unblocked exit to the north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

-= Scullery =-
You've entered a scullery. You begin looking for stuff.



There is an open hatch leading west. There is an unguarded exit to the east. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

-= Cellar =-
You are in a cellar. A standard one.

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a chest. You smell a wretched smell, and follow it to a stand. You shudder, but continue examining the stand. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You smell a sickening smell, and follow it to a table. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing hasn't got anything on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a shelf. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. However, the shelf, like an empty shelf, has nothing on it.

There is an open hatch leading east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

-= Sauna =-
You've seen better saunas, but at least this one seems pretty typical. The room is well lit.

You can see a counter. The counter is ordinary. On the counter you can make out a keycard.

There is an unguarded exit to the east.



>                                                                                                                                -= Sauna =-0/4
