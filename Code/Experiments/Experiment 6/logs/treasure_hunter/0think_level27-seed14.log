Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! First of all, you could, like, make an effort to venture west. Okay, and then, try to travel west.

With that over with, travel east. Then, attempt to venture north. With that over with, try to travel east. Okay, and then, try to go to the south. If you can manage that, make an attempt to take a trip south. That done, move south. That done, lift the mop from the floor of the laundry place. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

Oh, great. Here's a basket. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You can see a portmanteau. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this?

The locker is empty, what a horrible day!

You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.
