Welcome to another exciting episode of TextWorld! First thing I need you to do is to try to move south. With that over with, try to go west. And then, make an effort to go south. Once you do that, try to go to the west. Then, make an effort to go to the south. With that over with, make an effort to travel west. And then, take a trip south. Following that, attempt to take a trip east. After that, attempt to go east. Once you get through with that, attempt to go to the north. And then, pick-up the passkey from the floor of the spare room. Got that? Good!

-= Shower =-
You find yourself in a shower. An ordinary one.

You make out a locked safe close by. You make out a rack. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open passageway leading south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing a text-based game and has been moving through different rooms. The initial instructions were to move south, then west, then south again, and so on, eventually picking up a passkey from the spare room.

First, the user started in the Shower room, went south to the Sauna. Now, in the Sauna, the possible directions are north and west. The user's next move should follow the earlier pattern of moving south, west, south, etc. But since they're currently in the Sauna, the next step according to the initial instructions would be to go west. However, the user is asking if they're on the right track and if they're close to the goal. 

The user's current position is the Sauna. The previous steps involved moving south, then west, then south again. The next logical step in the sequence would be to go west again. But the user is in the Sauna, which has a west portal. So the next action should be to go west. However, the user is asking for confirmation, so maybe they need to proceed with the next step in the sequence. The original plan was to move south, west, south, west, south, east, north, and then pick up the passkey. 

But in the current scenario, after the Sauna, the next direction in the sequence would be west. So the correct next action is to go west. The user is in the Sauna, so moving west would be the next step. The user is asking if they're making the right moves, so the assistant should confirm that moving west is the next correct step. Therefore, the answer is to go west.

You've just shown up in a laundromat.



There is an open portal leading east. There is an open gate leading south.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game, and they've been moving through different rooms: shower, sauna, laundromat. The original goal was to pick up the passkey from the spare room. So far, they've gone south from the shower to the sauna, then west to the laundromat.

Hmm, the current location is the laundromat. The available exits are east and south. The user's previous actions were following a pattern of moving south, west, south, west, etc. But maybe they need to adjust their strategy. The passkey is in the spare room, which might be a specific location. Let me think about the possible paths.

In the shower, they went south to the sauna. Then west to laundromat. From laundromat, if they go south, maybe they can reach another area. But the user's next move is to decide between east or south. The original instruction mentioned moving south multiple times, but maybe they need to find a different path. Alternatively, maybe the spare room is connected via another route. Since the user is supposed to pick up the passkey from the spare room, they might need to explore further. But the current room has east and south exits. If they go south, perhaps they can find the spare room. Alternatively, going east might lead to another area. But without more info, the safest bet is to continue moving south as per the initial instructions. Wait, the user's previous actions were alternating south and west. But in the laundromat, the exits are east and south. Maybe the correct path is to go south again. Let me check the previous steps again. The user's initial commands were: go south, then west, then south, west, south, west, etc. But in the laundromat, the exits are east and south. So perhaps the next step is to go south again. But the user's next action is to decide between east or south. Since the original goal is to get to the spare room, maybe the correct path is to go south from laundromat. So the next action would be go south.

-= Bar =-
You arrive in a bar. A standard one.

You can make out a recliner. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.

There is an open gate leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Okay, let's see. The user has been moving through different locations: shower, sauna, laundromat, and now a bar. The original goal was to pick up the passkey from the spare room. So far, the user has been moving south, west, south again, and now they're in a bar.

In the bar, the possible directions are north, east, south, and west. The user's previous actions have been to go south, then west, then south again. Now, in the bar, the instructions mention that the exit to the west is unblocked. But the user's goal is to reach the spare room where the passkey is. 

Wait, the user hasn't found the passkey yet. The original plan was to move south, west, south, west, south, then east, then north, and pick up the passkey. But in the current location (bar), the user might need to go east or west. The bar's description says there's an exit to the west, so maybe going west from the bar would take them to the next area. But the user's previous steps have been moving south and west alternately. 

Alternatively, maybe the path requires moving east from the bar. The user is in the bar, and the options are north, east, south, west. The user needs to find the right path to the spare room. Since the user hasn't found the passkey yet, they need to continue moving towards the correct direction. 

In the previous steps, the user went south from the shower to the sauna, then west to the laundromat, then south to the bar. Now, from the bar, maybe the next step is to go east to proceed further. Alternatively, going west from the bar might lead to another area. But the user's original plan was to go east after several south and west movements. 

The user's next action should be to go east, as per the original plan. So the answer would be "go east".

You are in a cubicle. A typical kind of place. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

Oh, great. Here's a bookshelf. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Okay, let's see. The user has been moving through different rooms in the game: shower, sauna, laundromat, bar, and now a cubicle. The original goal was to pick up the passkey from the floor of the spare room. So far, the user has been moving south, west, south, east, and now west again. The current room is a cubicle with exits to the south and west.

The user's actions so far have been following a pattern of moving south and west, which might be part of navigating towards the spare room. However, the cubicle is described as oddly familiar, which might hint that it's a recurring location or part of a loop. The bookshelf in the cubicle is empty, so there's no item there. The exits are south and west, which are unblocked.

Since the goal is to reach the spare room and pick up the passkey, the user needs to find the correct path. The previous movements have been going through different areas, but the cubicle is a new location. The user might need to continue exploring from here. The next step could be to go south again, as that's one of the exits. Alternatively, going west might lead to another area. However, since the user has been moving south and west alternately, maybe continuing in the same pattern would help. But the cubicle's description suggests it's part of a loop, so maybe the user needs to find a different path. However, the user's previous actions have been following the instructions given, so perhaps continuing with the same direction (south or west) is the right move. Since the user's last action was going west, the next step might be to go south again. But the user's previous steps included moving south, east, west, etc. Maybe the user needs to check if the spare room is nearby. Alternatively, the user might need to explore the cubicle's exits. Since the cubicle has an exit to the south and west, and the user is in the cubicle, the next step could be to go south again. But the user's previous steps have been moving in a pattern, so maybe the correct path is to continue moving south to reach the spare room. Alternatively, the user might need to go west from the cubicle. However, the user's previous actions have been alternating directions. The user's last action was going west to the cubicle, so the next step might be to go south from there. But the user's goal is to reach the spare room, which might be in a different area. Since the user hasn't found the passkey yet, they need to continue exploring. The next action should be to go south from the cubicle.

Okay, let's see. The user has been moving through different rooms in the game: shower, sauna, laundromat, bar, cubicle, and now the studio. The original goal was to pick up the passkey from the floor of the spare room. So far, the player has been moving south, west, etc., but hasn't found the passkey yet.

In the current room, the studio, the description mentions a desk that's empty. The exits are north and west. The user's previous actions have been systematically moving south and west, but maybe they need to check different directions or look for clues. However, the game's feedback so far hasn't indicated any items except the passkey in the spare room. 

Wait, the user's initial instructions mentioned the passkey is in the spare room's floor. The current room is the studio. The player needs to navigate to the spare room. Maybe the path requires going north or west from the studio. The user's next action should be to check the available exits. The studio has a north and west exit. Since the user has been moving south and west, perhaps trying north now would be a good idea to explore another path. Alternatively, maybe the spare room is connected through a different route. But based on the previous movements, the user has been going south and west, so perhaps the next step is to go north from the studio. Let me check the available exits again. The studio has north and west. The user hasn't tried north yet. So the next action should be to go north.

Okay, let's see. The user has been moving through different rooms in the game, starting from the shower, sauna, laundromat, bar, cubicle, studio, and back to the cubicle. The original goal was to pick up the passkey from the floor of the spare room.

So far, the player has been moving south, west, east, north, and back. The current location is the cubicle again. The user is asking if the actions so far are correct and if they're close to the goal. The assistant needs to decide the next move.

Looking at the cubicle description: there's a bookshelf with nothing on it, and exits to the south and west. The previous moves have been going back and forth between cubicle and studio. The passkey is in the spare room, which hasn't been mentioned yet. Maybe the spare room is a different location. The user's path hasn't reached the spare room yet. The current location is the cubicle, so the next step should be to check the exits again. Since the user has been moving west and south, maybe trying west again could lead to another room.

Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text adventure game, and they've been moving through different rooms: shower, sauna, laundromat, bar, cubicle, studio, and back through the cubicle and bar again. The goal mentioned earlier was to pick up the passkey from the floor of the spare room.

Looking at the current room, which is the Bar, the user has been moving west and east, north and south. The previous steps seem to be retracing their path. The key thing to note is that the user is supposed to find the passkey in the spare room. So far, the user hasn't mentioned encountering the passkey yet. 

The current room is the Bar, and the exits are north, east, south, and west. The user's previous actions have led them back to the Bar, which might be part of a loop. Since the goal is to get the passkey from the spare room, maybe the spare room is another location that hasn't been explored yet. 

But in the rooms visited so far (shower, sauna, laundromat, bar, cubicle, studio), there's no mention of a spare room. Wait, the original instruction said to pick up the passkey from the floor of the spare room. So perhaps the spare room is a different location that hasn't been visited yet. 

The user's current position is the Bar. The exits from the Bar are north, east, south, and west. The user has been moving west and south, but maybe they need to go east or north to reach the spare room. Alternatively, maybe the spare room is the studio or another room they've already been in. 

Wait, the studio was mentioned earlier. Let me check the previous steps again. The user went from the cubicle to the studio, then back to the cubicle. The studio had a desk but nothing on it. The spare room might be a different location. 

Alternatively, maybe the spare room is the laundromat or the sauna. But the user hasn't explored those areas beyond the initial steps. The user's path seems to be looping between the bar, cubicle, and studio. 

Since the user hasn't found the passkey yet, they need to explore other rooms. The next logical step would be to check the other exits from the current room (Bar) to see if any of them lead to the spare room. The user has been going west and south, but maybe they need to go east or north. 

Looking at the Bar's description again: "You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south. There is an exit to the west." So the exits are north, east, south, west. The user has been going west and south, but maybe they need to go east or north to reach the spare room. 

Since the user is at the Bar, the next action should be to go east or north. But the user's previous actions have been moving west and south, so maybe they need to go east to explore a new area. 

Alternatively, maybe the spare room is the studio, but the user hasn't checked there yet. However, the studio was mentioned as having a desk but nothing on it. 

Given that the user is at the Bar, the next step should be to go east or north. The user's previous action was going west, so perhaps the next step is to go east to explore that direction. 

Therefore, the correct next action would be to go east.

Okay, let's see. The user has been moving through different rooms in the game, alternating between going south, west, and east. The goal mentioned earlier was to pick up the passkey from the floor of the spare room. So far, the player has been moving through various rooms like the shower, sauna, laundromat, bar, cubicle, and studio. The current room is the cubicle again, which they've been in before.

The user's actions so far have been systematic, moving in a pattern of south, west, east, and repeating. The game's environment seems to loop between rooms, possibly indicating that the player needs to find a specific path or object. The passkey is mentioned as being in the spare room, which hasn't been explored yet. 

In the current cubicle, there's a bookshelf but nothing on it. The exits are south and west. Since the player has already been in the cubicle before, maybe there's a clue or a hidden item here. However, the bookshelf is empty. The previous rooms like the bar and studio didn't have any items except for the desk in the studio, which was empty. 

The user's next action should be to continue exploring the available exits. Since the cubicle has exits to the south and west, and the player has been moving west and east in previous steps, maybe the next logical step is to go south again. But the user has already done that before. Alternatively, maybe the player needs to find a different path. However, the instructions mentioned going east after reaching the cubicle again. 

Wait, the user's previous action was going east from the bar to the cubicle again. Now, in the cubicle, the exits are south and west. The user might need to try going west again, but that's been done before. Alternatively, maybe the player needs to check the south exit again. But the user has already been there. 

Alternatively, maybe the passkey is in the spare room, which hasn't been mentioned yet. The spare room might be a different location. The user's path so far hasn't included that. The initial instructions said to go south, west, south, west, south, east, north, west, etc. Maybe the player is going in circles. 

But according to the game's structure, the user needs to continue moving through the rooms. The next action should be to go south again from the cubicle, as that's the exit available. Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go west again. But the user has already done that. 

Wait, the user's last action was going east from the bar to the cubicle. Now, in the cubicle, the exits are south and west. The user's next move could be to go south again, which would take them back to the studio, or west to the bar again. But the user has been moving in a loop. 

However, the original goal was to pick up the passkey from the spare room. The spare room hasn't been encountered yet. Maybe the player needs to find a different path. But according to the current room, the exits are only south and west. The user might need to continue exploring those. 

Alternatively, maybe the player is supposed to go west from the cubicle, but that's already been done. The user might be stuck in a loop. However, the game's environment might have a specific path to the spare room. 

Since the user's previous actions have been moving in a pattern, the next logical step is to continue moving in the same direction. The user has been going south, west, east, north, west, etc. Now, in the cubicle, the user should go south again. But the user has already been there. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west again from the cubicle. But that's the same as before. The user might need to find a different way. However, the game's structure might require continuing to move through the rooms. 

In the current context, the user's next action should be to go south from the cubicle. That's the only exit available. So the answer is "go south".

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user has been moving through different rooms in the game, alternating between going south, west, and east. The goal mentioned earlier was to pick up the passkey from the floor of the spare room. So far, the player has been moving through various rooms like the shower, sauna, laundromat, bar, cubicle, and studio. The current location is the Studio, and the next possible exits are north and west.

The user's previous actions have been to go south, west, east, and so on, which suggests a pattern of moving between rooms. The challenge is to find the spare room where the passkey is located. Since the user is currently in the Studio, which is room 6, and the next steps involve moving north or west, I need to check if any of these directions lead closer to the spare room.

Looking at the previous rooms, the spare room might be in a different part of the map. The user has been moving in a loop between the cubicle and studio, so maybe the passkey is in a room that's not yet explored. The user needs to break the cycle and find the correct path. Since the Studio has an exit to the north and west, trying west might lead to a new area. Alternatively, going north could lead back to the cubicle. However, the user needs to find the spare room, which might be in a different direction. Since the original instruction mentioned the spare room, perhaps the correct path is to continue moving west from the Studio. But I need to check the possible exits again.

In the Studio, the user is told to try going north or west. The user's previous moves have been to go south and west, so maybe the correct path is to go west from the Studio. However, the user has already been in the cubicle and studio multiple times. Alternatively, maybe the passkey is in the bar or another room. But according to the current setup, the user needs to proceed to the next room. Since the user is in the Studio, the next action should be to go west, as that's the unblocked exit mentioned. So the next command would be "go west".
</think>go west

-= Spare Room =-
I never took you for the sort of person who would show up in a spare room, but I guess I was wrong.



There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

There is a passkey on the floor.

Okay, let's see. The user has been moving through different rooms in the game, following a pattern of going south, west, etc. The goal mentioned earlier was to pick up the passkey from the floor of the spare room.

Looking at the current scene, the user is in the Spare Room. The description mentions a passkey on the floor. The previous action was going west, which led to the Spare Room. Now, the next logical step would be to pick up the passkey. Since the user is already in the Spare Room, the command should be to pick up the passkey. The game's environment indicates that the passkey is there, so the correct action is to take it. The user's previous actions have been moving around, so now they need to interact with the item mentioned.
