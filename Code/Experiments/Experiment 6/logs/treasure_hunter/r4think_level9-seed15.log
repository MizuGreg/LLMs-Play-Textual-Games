Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user has been moving through different rooms in the text-based game. The goal mentioned earlier was to retrieve the banana from the floor of the workshop. 

Looking at the current room, the Workshop, there's a banana on the floor. The user's last action was going north into the workshop. Now, the next step should be to pick up the banana. The prompt says to only output the action, so the correct command here is "take banana" or "get banana". But in many text adventures, the command is "take" followed by the item. So the correct action is "take banana".
</think>take banana
