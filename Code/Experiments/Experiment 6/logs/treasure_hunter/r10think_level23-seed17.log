I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is how to play! First of all, you could, like, retrieve the passkey from the floor of the bedroom. And then, make an effort to go east. Then, insert the passkey into the portal within the scullery's lock to unlock it. After that, ensure that the portal in the scullery is open. After that, head south. Then, make an effort to go south. And then, recover the sandwich from the cabinet inside the dish-pit. Got that? Good!

-= Bedroom =-
You are in a bedroom. A typical kind of place.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a passkey on the floor.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is trying to play a text-based game called TextWorld. The goal seems to be to retrieve a passkey, use it to unlock a portal, and then proceed to get a sandwich from a cabinet in the dish-pit.

First, the user starts in the bedroom, picks up the passkey, and goes east to the scullery. The scullery has a closed portal leading south and an exit to the west. The user is trying to insert the passkey into the portal to unlock it. But every time they try, the game responds with "That can't contain things." which is confusing because the passkey is in their inventory.

Wait, maybe the action isn't "insert passkey into portal" but something else. In text adventures, sometimes you have to use specific verbs like "use" or "put" instead of "insert". The user has tried "insert" multiple times, but the game isn't recognizing it. Maybe the correct verb is "use" or "put into".

Looking back at the initial instructions, the user was told to "insert the passkey into the portal within the scullery's lock to unlock it." So the correct action might be "use passkey on portal" or "insert passkey into portal". But the game is saying "That can't contain things." which suggests that the portal isn't a container, but rather a lock or something else.

Alternatively, maybe the portal is a door that needs to be unlocked with the passkey. In that case, the correct action might be "unlock portal with passkey" or "use passkey to unlock portal".

But the user has tried "insert passkey into portal" multiple times, and the game keeps rejecting it. Maybe the game expects a different verb. Let me think of possible commands. In many text games, you might say "use passkey on portal" or "put passkey in portal". But the game's error message says "That can't contain things," which implies that the portal isn't a container, so putting something into it isn't the right action.

Alternatively, maybe the portal is a lock that needs to be unlocked with the passkey. So the correct action is "unlock portal with passkey". But the user hasn't tried that yet.

Wait, the initial instruction said "insert the passkey into the portal within the scullery's lock to unlock it." So the action is to insert the passkey into the portal. But the game is not accepting that. Maybe the game is using a different verb, like "use" or "insert" is not the correct verb here.

Alternatively, maybe the portal is a door, and the correct action is to "use passkey on portal" or "unlock portal". But the user has tried inserting it multiple times, and the game keeps saying it can't contain things.

Hmm. Maybe the game is expecting the user to "use" the passkey on the portal. Let me try that. The user's last action was "insert passkey into portal", which the game rejected. So perhaps the correct command is "use passkey on portal" or "use passkey to unlock portal".

Alternatively, maybe the portal is a lock, and the correct action is to "unlock portal with passkey". But the user hasn't tried that yet.

Since the game keeps saying "That can't contain things," which suggests that the portal isn't a container, the user should try a different action. Maybe the correct action is to "unlock portal" using the passkey. But the user hasn't tried that yet.

So, the next step would be to try using the passkey to unlock the portal, perhaps with the verb "unlock" or "use".

Okay, the user is stuck in the Recreation Zone. They tried looking around multiple times, but the game keeps saying they can't see anything. The previous actions involved unlocking the portal in the scullery and moving south to reach here. The goal was to get the sandwich from the dish-pit.

Wait, the user hasn't mentioned anything about the dish-pit yet. The original plan was to go east, unlock the portal, go south, then recover the sandwich from the dish-pit. But now they're in the Recreation Zone. Maybe they need to find a way to get to the dish-pit from here. The Recreation Zone has an open portal north, an open door west, and an exit south. The exit south would take them back to the scullery or another area. Maybe the dish-pit is in a different direction. Alternatively, maybe the chest in the Recreation Zone is part of the puzzle. But the chest is empty and already open. The user might need to check the west door. Let me think: the user is in the Recreation Zone. The west door could lead to another area. Maybe the dish-pit is west of here. So the next step would be to go west and check that area. Alternatively, maybe the portal north leads to another part. But the original goal was to get the sandwich from the dish-pit. So perhaps the user needs to find the dish-pit. Since they're in the Recreation Zone, maybe the west door leads to the dish-pit. So the next action should be to go west.

There is an open door leading east. There is an unguarded exit to the south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Studio and Attic. They've been trying to open the trunk and box but haven't found the sandwich yet. The original goal was to get the sandwich from the dish-pit. Maybe they need to find another way to get to the dish-pit. Let me check the previous areas. The Recreation Zone had a chest, but it was empty. The Studio has a locked trunk and an empty box. The Attic has a shelf. Maybe the dish-pit is in a different location. Wait, the user was told to "recover the sandwich from the cabinet inside the dish-pit." So maybe the dish-pit is in a different area. The user has been moving between rooms but hasn't found the dish-pit yet. Perhaps they need to go south from the Studio exit. The Studio has an exit to the south. Let me check the previous steps. When the user was in the Recreation Zone, they could go south to the scullery. Maybe from the Studio, going south would lead to another area. Alternatively, maybe the dish-pit is in the west direction from the Studio. But the user tried going west and ended up in the Attic. Hmm. The user needs to find the dish-pit cabinet. Since the previous steps didn't find it, maybe they need to check other rooms. Alternatively, maybe the sandwich is in the trunk or box, but they are empty. Wait, the user was supposed to get the sandwich from the dish-pit, not from the trunk or box. So maybe the user needs to find the dish-pit. The original path was: bedroom -> scullery -> portal -> recreation zone -> studio -> attic -> ... but maybe the dish-pit is in a different path. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go back to the scullery and check the portal again. But the portal was already opened. Alternatively, maybe the dish-pit is in the west direction from the Studio. The user tried going west and ended up in the Attic. Maybe the dish-pit is in the Attic's shelf? But the shelf is empty. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east from the Studio again. But that leads back to the same place. This is confusing. The user might need to find another way to get to the dish-pit. Since the original plan was to go east, unlock the portal, go south, then get the sandwich, maybe the user is missing a step. Wait, after unlocking the portal in the scullery, they went south to the Recreation Zone, then maybe the dish-pit is in a different direction. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check the exit to the south from the Studio. Let me check the Studio's description again. The Studio has an exit to the south. So maybe going south from the Studio would lead to the dish-pit. The user hasn't tried that yet. So the next action should be to go south from the Studio.

Okay, the user is in the Pantry now. The original goal was to get the sandwich from the dish-pit. The Pantry has a closed toolbox and a display. Maybe the dish-pit is in a different area, but the user has been moving between rooms without finding it. The previous areas included the Salon, Bar, Still Workshop, and now the Pantry. The user needs to find the dish-pit cabinet. Since the Pantry has a toolbox, maybe the user should check if the toolbox is related. But the toolbox is closed. The user might need to open it.

Okay, the user is in the Pantry and found a sandwich in the toolbox. But when they tried to take it, the game said they can't see any such thing. Wait, maybe the sandwich is already in their inventory? Or maybe they need to pick it up first. The toolbox was opened, and the sandwich was inside. So the correct action would be to take the sandwich from the toolbox. But the user tried "take sandwich" and it didn't work. Maybe the correct command is "take sandwich from toolbox" or "get sandwich". But the game might expect a different verb. Alternatively, maybe the sandwich is already in the toolbox, and the user needs to pick it up. Let me check the previous steps. The user opened the toolbox and found the sandwich. So the next step is to take the sandwich. The game might not recognize "take sandwich" because it's not in the current location. Wait, the user is in the Pantry, and the sandwich is in the toolbox. So the correct command is "take sandwich from toolbox". But the game might not accept that. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use "get" instead of "take". But the game's previous responses didn't accept "get". Alternatively, maybe the sandwich is already in the inventory. But the user hasn't picked it up yet. The game's response was "You can't see any such thing." which suggests that the sandwich isn't visible. Maybe the user needs to check the toolbox again. But the toolbox is already open. Hmm. The user might need to use the correct command to pick up the sandwich. The correct action is "take sandwich" but the game says it's not recognized. Maybe the game expects "get sandwich" or "pick up sandwich". But the user has to try the correct command. Since the user is in the Pantry and the sandwich is in the toolbox, the correct command is "take sandwich from toolbox". But the game might not accept that. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use "take" without specifying the toolbox. But the game says "can't see any such thing", so maybe the sandwich is not in the current view. Wait, the user opened the toolbox and found the sandwich. So the sandwich should be visible. Maybe the game is expecting "take sandwich" but it's not working.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, the user is in the Pantry and found a sandwich in the toolbox. They tried to take it multiple times, but the game keeps saying "You can't see any such thing." Maybe the sandwich isn't in the toolbox anymore, or maybe the toolbox is closed again. Wait, the user opened the toolbox earlier, and the sandwich was inside. But when they tried to take it, it wasn't visible. Maybe the sandwich is already in their inventory, but the game isn't recognizing it. Alternatively, maybe the correct command is different. The user might need to use "get" instead of "take". Or perhaps the sandwich is in the toolbox, and the user needs to specify the toolbox in the command. Let me think: the correct command should be "take sandwich from toolbox" or "get sandwich from toolbox". But the game is not accepting it. Maybe the game expects "take sandwich" without specifying the toolbox, but the user is in the Pantry, so the sandwich is in the toolbox. The user might need to check if the toolbox is open again. Wait, the user opened the toolbox earlier, so it should be open. Maybe the game is having a glitch, but the user has to keep trying. The next action should be to take the sandwich from the toolbox again, even though the game says it's not visible. Maybe the user needs to try a different verb like "get" or "pick up". But the user has to follow the game's expected commands. The correct action is "take sandwich from toolbox".
