I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First step, make an effort to venture north. Then, pick up the pear from the toolbox within the spare room. Got that? Good!

-= Basement =-
You arrive in a basement. An ordinary kind of place. Let's see what's in here.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Spare Room =-
You find yourself in a spare room. A standard kind of place.

You can see an opened toolbox in the room. The toolbox contains a pear. Now that's what I call TextWorld!

There is an open passageway leading east. There is an open portal leading west. There is an unguarded exit to the south.
