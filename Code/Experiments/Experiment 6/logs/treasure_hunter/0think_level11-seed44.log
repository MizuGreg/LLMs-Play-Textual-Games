Welcome to TextWorld! Here is how to play! First of all, attempt to travel west. Then, pick up the broom from the floor of the attic. That's it!

-= Studio =-
Of every studio you could have walked into, you had to show up in an ordinary one.

You can see a locker. Classic TextWorld.

There is an open portal leading east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

-= Attic =-
You've just sauntered into an attic.

You can see a closed coffer.

There is an unblocked exit to the east.

There is a broom on the floor.
