Welcome to TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First, it would be good if you could make an attempt to move east. That done, make an attempt to go to the north. And then, pick-up the loaf of bread from the floor of the dish-pit. Alright, thanks!

-= Salon =-
You've entered a salon. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go east
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Canteen =-
You have walked into a canteen. Not the canteen you'd expect. No, this is a canteen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You see an opened freezer in the corner. What a letdown! The freezer is empty!

There is an open gate leading east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go north

-= Dish-Pit =-
You arrive in a dish-pit. An ordinary one.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

There is a loaf of bread on the floor.

That's not a verb I recognise.
