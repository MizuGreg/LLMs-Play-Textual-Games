I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! First, it would be a great idea if you could make an attempt to travel north. With that accomplished, look and see that the wooden portal inside the study is open. Having opened the wooden portal, make an attempt to go west. Next, open the passageway. After that, go to the west. With that done, take a trip west. And then, take the latchkey from the case inside the cellar. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Garage =-
You've entered a garage.

Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a rack. The rack appears to be empty.

There is an open gateway leading north. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

-= Study =-
You've stumbled into a normal room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be normal. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the study.

If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a shelf. The shelf appears to be empty. You see an armchair. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is a closed wooden portal leading west. There is an open gateway leading south. There is an unguarded exit to the east.

You can see an opened chest in the room. The chest is empty, what a horrible day! Look over there! a pan. The pan is ordinary. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is an open wooden portal leading east. There is a closed passageway leading west.

You can see a plate. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to a table. The table is standard. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open passageway leading east. There is an open portal leading south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

You make out a closed bureau close by. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a mantelpiece. The mantelpiece is ordinary. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Bathroom =-
You find yourself in a bathroom. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You make out a board. You shudder, but continue examining the board. But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is an open portal leading north. There is an open hatch leading west. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east.
