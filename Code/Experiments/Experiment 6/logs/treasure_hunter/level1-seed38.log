Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Your task for today is to pick-up the key from the floor of the vault.

-= Vault =-
You've entered a vault. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

There is a key on the floor.
