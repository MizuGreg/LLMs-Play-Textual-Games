You are now playing a exciting round of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First thing I need you to do is to attempt to move west. Then, open the gate. After that, go south. After that, open the door within the study. Once you have opened the door, go to the south. After that, recover the keycard from the shelf within the dish-pit. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Closet =-
You've just shown up in a closet. You start to take note of what's in the room.



There is an open passageway leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

-= Launderette =-
You are in a launderette. A typical one. You can barely contain your excitement.

Look over there! a cabinet. You make out a bench. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is a closed gate leading south. There is an open passageway leading east.

-= Dish-Pit =-
You are in a dish-pit. A typical one. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

You can see a shelf. The shelf is standard. On the shelf you can make out a keycard. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it.

There is an open door leading north. There is an open portal leading south.

There is a worm on the floor.
