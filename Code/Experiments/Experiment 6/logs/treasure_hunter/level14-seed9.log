Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an exciting round of TextWorld? You do! Here is how to play! First stop, ensure that the passageway within the basement is open. And then, head south. And then, attempt to go west. Then, move north. Then, recover the poem from the floor of the bedchamber. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Basement =-
You're now in the basement. Let's see what's in here.

You can make out a locked chest. You see a safe. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You make out a shelf. The shelf is normal. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is a closed passageway leading south. There is an open door leading north. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through this TextWorld game. The current location is the basement. The goal mentioned earlier was to ensure the passageway within the basement is open, then go south, west, north, and recover the poem from the bedchamber.

In the basement, there's a closed passageway south, an open door north, and an exit west. The user tried to go south first, but the game responded that the passageway needs to be opened. So the next logical step is to figure out how to open that passageway. 

Looking at the items in the basement: there's a locked chest, a safe, and a shelf. The safe might be a clue. Maybe the safe needs to be opened to find a key or something that can unlock the passageway. The chest is locked, but there's no mention of a key yet. The shelf is normal but empty. 

Since the user is instructed to first open the passageway, perhaps the safe contains a key. So the next action should be to interact with the safe. The command would be to open the safe. That makes sense because the safe is a common element in such games that might hold an item needed to proceed. 

Alternatively, maybe the chest has a key, but since it's locked, the user might need a key to open it. But since the safe is mentioned as "TextWorld!" maybe it's more likely to be the safe that's the next target. So the next action is to open the safe.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this TextWorld game. The original goal was to go through a series of steps: open the passageway in the basement, go south, then west, north, and recover the poem from the bedchamber.

First, they started in the basement. The initial steps mentioned were to ensure the passageway is open, then go south, west, north, etc. But the user first went south, but the game said the passageway had to be opened first. So the user tried to open the safe instead. Now, after opening the safe, the next step would be to check if the passageway is open. Wait, the user's next action should be to open the passageway. But the game might have a specific way to do that. Alternatively, maybe the safe is part of the process to get the key or something. But the user's previous action was opening the safe, and now they need to proceed.

Wait, the original instruction said to first ensure the passageway is open. The user tried to go south first, but the game said the passageway was closed. Then the user tried to open the safe. Now, after opening the safe, maybe the next step is to check the passageway again. Or maybe the safe's contents are a key to open the passageway. But the user's next action should be to open the passageway. However, the user might need to find the right item to open it. Alternatively, maybe the passageway is already open, but the user needs to check. But according to the game's feedback, the passageway was closed initially. So the user needs to open it. But how? Maybe the safe's contents are the key. So after opening the safe, the user would take the key and then open the passageway. But the user's next action should be to open the passageway. But the game might require the key first. However, the user's last action was opening the safe, so the next step is to check if the passageway is now open. But the game might not have that yet. Alternatively, maybe the safe is not related. The user might need to find the right item to open the passageway. But the user's next action should be to open the passageway. However, the game might have a specific command for that. So the correct next action is to open the passageway. But the user might need to find the key first. But according to the game's current state, after opening the safe, the next step is to open the passageway. So the answer is to open the passageway.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this TextWorld game. The original goal was to go through a series of steps: open the passageway in the basement, go south, then west, north, and recover the poem from the bedchamber.

So far, the user has been in the basement. They first tried to go south, but the passageway was locked. Then they opened the safe, which might have been a red herring. Then they opened the passageway, which allowed them to proceed south. Now, the next step according to the initial instructions was to go south after opening the passageway. Since the passageway is now open, the next logical step is to move south. The user's last action was opening the passageway, so the next command should be "go south" to continue towards the next area. The user needs to follow the sequence of actions given in the initial prompt, so moving south is the next correct step.

-= Sauna =-
You find yourself in a sauna. A typical one.



There is an open passageway leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

There is a sponge on the floor.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this TextWorld game, and they've been moving through different rooms. The original goal was to ensure the basement passageway is open, then go south, west, north, and recover the poem from the bedchamber.

So far, they started in the basement, opened the safe, then the passageway, and went south into the sauna. Now, in the sauna, the next step would be to check if they're on the right track. The sauna has a sponge on the floor, and the possible directions are north, east, west. The user's last action was "go south", which led them to the sauna. 

The original plan was to go south from the basement, then west, then north. But in the sauna, going north would take them back to the basement. Maybe they need to go east or west from here. The user's next action should follow the initial plan. Wait, the initial instructions said after going south from the basement, attempt to go west. But in the sauna, the west exit is unblocked. However, the user is now in the sauna, so maybe they need to go east instead. But the original plan was to go west from the basement. Wait, maybe there's a confusion here. Let me retrace.

Original steps: Start in basement, open passageway (which was closed), then head south (to sauna), then attempt to go west. But in the sauna, the west exit is unblocked. So maybe after going south to the sauna, the next step is to go west. But the user's last action was "go south", leading to the sauna. Now, the next action should be to go west. But the user's last input was "go south", and the current location is sauna. So the next step is to go west from the sauna. But the user's next action should be "go west" to proceed. However, the user's previous action was "go south", and the current room is sauna. The original plan was to go south, then west. So in the sauna, going west would be the next step. But the user's next action is to go west. However, the user's last action was "go south", and the current room is sauna. The correct next step is to go west. But the user might have to check if that's the right move. Alternatively, maybe they need to go east. But according to the original plan, after going south from the basement, the next step was to go west. So in the sauna, going west would be the next step. Therefore, the next action should be "go west".

-= Spare Room =-
You are in a spare room. A typical one.

You can make out an opened ordinary looking cabinet in the corner. The cabinet is empty, what a horrible day!

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this TextWorld game, and they've been moving through different rooms. The original goal was to ensure the basement passageway is open, then go south, west, north, and recover the poem from the bedchamber.

So far, they started in the basement, opened the safe, opened the passageway, went south to the sauna, then west to the spare room. Now, in the spare room, they found an empty cabinet. The next step according to the initial instructions was to go north after recovering the poem. But the user hasn't recovered the poem yet. 

Wait, the current room is the spare room. The user's last action was going west from the sauna to the spare room. The next logical step might be to check if there's a way to proceed towards the bedchamber. The spare room has an exit to the north. But the original plan was to go west, then north. However, in the spare room, the exit to the north is unblocked. So maybe the user should go north from here. But the original goal mentioned recovering the poem from the bedchamber. So perhaps the bedchamber is north of the spare room? Or maybe the user needs to check other rooms.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to collect the poem from the bedchamber, which might be in a different location. But the current room is the spare room. The user hasn't found the poem yet. The initial instructions said to recover the poem from the floor of the bedchamber. So maybe the bedchamber is north of the spare room. So going north from the spare room would lead to the bedchamber. Then, once there, the user can recover the poem. 

But the user's current location is the spare room. The next action should be to go north to reach the bedchamber. So the correct command would be "go north". But the user might have to check if there's a way to get to the bedchamber. The spare room has an exit to the north, so that's the direction to take. Therefore, the next action is "go north".

-= Bedchamber =-
You find yourself in a bedchamber. An usual kind of place.



There is an unblocked exit to the east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

There is a poem on the floor.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this TextWorld game, and they've been moving through different rooms. The original goal was to recover the poem from the bedchamber. Let me check the steps they've taken so far.

Starting in the basement, they opened the safe, then the passageway, went south to the sauna, then west to the spare room, north to the bedchamber. Now, in the bedchamber, there's a poem on the floor. The prompt says "recover the poem from the floor of the bedchamber." So the next logical step is to pick up the poem. But the user's last action was going north to the bedchamber. The current room is the bedchamber, and the poem is there. So the correct action would be to take the poem. But the game might require using the correct command, like "take poem" or "get poem". However, in some TextWorld implementations, the command might just be "take" followed by the item. But the user's previous actions were movement commands. Wait, in the bedchamber description, it says "There is a poem on the floor." So the player needs to pick it up. The correct command here would be "take poem" or "get poem". But the user's previous actions were all movement commands. Let me check the history again.

The user's last action was "go north" to reach the bedchamber. Now, in the bedchamber, the next step is to recover the poem. So the next command should be "take poem" or similar. But the user's previous commands were all "go [direction]". However, in TextWorld, the correct command to pick up an item is usually "take [item]". So the answer here should be "take poem".
