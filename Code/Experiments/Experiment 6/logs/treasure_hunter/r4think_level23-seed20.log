Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. Your first objective is to ensure that the hatch in the chamber is open. Then, try to travel east. Okay, and then, move north. Once you do that, make an attempt to head west. And then, go to the west. Then, go north. And then, pick up the loaf of bread from the counter. That's it!

-= Chamber =-
You have fallen into the most typical of all possible chambers. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You can make out a basket. You see a shelf. The shelf is usual. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.

There is a closed hatch leading east. There is an open gateway leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

-= Salon =-
Guess what, you are in the place we're calling the salon. Let's see what's in here.

You can see a locked locker. You make out an opened portmanteau. The portmanteau is empty! What a waste of a day! You make out an opened chest, which looks usual, here. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You can make out a bed. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.
