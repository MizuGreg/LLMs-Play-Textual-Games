Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First stop, make an effort to move east. And then, attempt to travel south. With that accomplished, attempt to move east. Once you manage that, venture north. After that, make an attempt to venture east. With that done, take a trip north. If you can accomplish that, lift the key from the floor of the studio. Got that? Good!

-= Garage =-
Well how about that, you are in the place we're calling the garage.

You can make out a locked locker. You make out an opened chest in the corner. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this?

There is an open passageway leading east. There is an open portal leading north.
