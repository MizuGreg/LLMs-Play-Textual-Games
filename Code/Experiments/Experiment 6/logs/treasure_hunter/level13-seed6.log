Welcome to another fast paced game of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, you could, like, travel north. And then, attempt to go to the west. With that accomplished, take a trip west. If you can do that, pick up the chocolate bar from the floor of the workshop. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Lounge =-
You've just shown up in a lounge.

You see a bed. The bed appears to be empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the bed.

There is an open portal leading east. There is an open gate leading west. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north.

You've moved into an ordinary room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be ordinary. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the recreation zone.

You can make out a bookshelf. The bookshelf is ordinary. But there isn't a thing on it. You can see a bar. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the bar.

There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game. The goal is to pick up the chocolate bar from the workshop after moving west twice. So far, they've gone north from the lounge to the recreation zone. The current room is the recreation zone, which has a bookshelf, an empty bar, and an exit to the south. The prompt says to try going west.

Wait, the user's previous action was "go north", which took them to the recreation zone. Now, the next step according to the instructions is to attempt to go west. But in the recreation zone description, there's an exit to the south, but nothing mentioned about a west exit. However, the initial instructions said to first go north, then attempt to go west. Maybe the recreation zone has a west exit that's not explicitly mentioned? Or maybe the user needs to check the directions again.

Looking back at the initial setup: the lounge had an open portal east and an open gate west. Then after going north to the recreation zone, the user is told to try going west. But in the recreation zone, the exits mentioned are south. Maybe the west exit is available here. The user needs to try going west again. So the next action should be "go west" from the recreation zone. That's the next step in the sequence. The user needs to follow the steps: north, then west, then west again to reach the workshop. So the correct next command is "go west".

-= Kitchenette =-
You've just walked into a kitchenette.

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a cabinet. You can make out a saucepan. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Okay, let's see. The user has been moving through different rooms: first the Lounge, then the Recreation Zone, and now the Kitchenette. The goal is to pick up the chocolate bar from the workshop.

In the Lounge, they went north to the Recreation Zone. Then west to the Kitchenette. The next step would be to check if there's a way to get to the workshop. The Kitchenette has an exit to the east and west. The user might need to go east back to the Recreation Zone or continue west. But the original plan was to go west from the Lounge, then west again. Wait, the initial instructions said: first go north, then attempt to go west, then take a trip west. So maybe after the Kitchenette, they need to go east back to the Recreation Zone, then west again to reach the workshop where the chocolate is.

But in the Kitchenette, the exit to the east is unguarded. So maybe going east back to the Recreation Zone, then west again to the Workshop. The user is currently in the Kitchenette. The next action should be to go east to return to the Recreation Zone. Then from there, go west to the Workshop. But the user's last action was go west, leading to Kitchenette. Now, the next step is to go east to get back to the Recreation Zone. Then from there, go west to the Workshop. So the next command should be go east.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game where they have to navigate through different rooms and collect a chocolate bar. The goal is to go north, then west, then west again, and pick up the chocolate in the workshop.

So far, the user started in the Lounge, went north to the Recreation Zone, then west to the Kitchenette, and then east back to the Recreation Zone. Now they're back in the Recreation Zone again. The current room description mentions a bookshelf and a bar, both empty. The exits are south and west. 

The user's next action should be to go west again, as per the original plan. The previous steps were moving west from the Lounge to Recreation Zone, then west again to Kitchenette, then east back. But the goal is to go west from the Kitchenette. Wait, the user is in the Recreation Zone now. The original plan was to go north, then west, then west. But after going east from Kitchenette, they're back in Recreation Zone. So maybe the next step is to go west again from Recreation Zone to reach the Kitchenette again? Or maybe there's a different path. 

Wait, the original instructions said: first go north, then attempt to go west, then take a trip west. So after going north to Recreation Zone, the user tried west to Kitchenette, then east back. Now they're back in Recreation Zone. The next step should be to go west again from Recreation Zone to get back to Kitchenette, then proceed further west to the workshop where the chocolate is. But the user might have already passed through the workshop. Alternatively, maybe the workshop is in the west direction from Recreation Zone. 

But in the current room (Recreation Zone), the exits are south and west. So going west from here would take them to the Kitchenette again. Then from Kitchenette, they can go west again to the workshop. So the next action should be to go west from Recreation Zone to Kitchenette, then west again to the workshop. But the user is currently in Recreation Zone, so the next command is go west.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and collect a chocolate bar. The goal is to go north, then west, then west again, and pick up the chocolate in the workshop.

So far, the user has moved from the Lounge to the Recreation Zone, then to the Kitchenette, and back to the Recreation Zone again. The current room is the Kitchenette, and the possible exits are east and west. The user's last action was "go west", which took them back to the Recreation Zone. Now, they're at the Kitchenette again, and the prompt says to go east or west. 

The original plan was to go north, then west twice. But after moving north from the Lounge, they went west to the Kitchenette, then east back to Recreation Zone, then west again. Wait, maybe they're stuck in a loop between Recreation Zone and Kitchenette. The chocolate is in the workshop, which is probably east of the Lounge. But the user has already gone east from the Lounge, which was the Recreation Zone. Maybe the workshop is further east? But the user is currently in the Kitchenette, which is connected to the Recreation Zone. 

Wait, the initial instructions said: after going north, attempt to go west, then take a trip west again. So maybe after going north to Recreation Zone, they need to go west to Kitchenette, then west again to reach the workshop. But in the current state, the user is in the Kitchenette, and the exit to the west is unguarded. So going west from Kitchenette would take them to the Recreation Zone again. But the workshop isn't in the Recreation Zone. Maybe the workshop is east of the Kitchenette? But the user can't go east from the Kitchenette because that's the Recreation Zone. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east from the Kitchenette to the Recreation Zone, then west again to the Workshop. But the user's last action was going west from Recreation Zone to Kitchenette. Maybe they need to go east from Kitchenette to Recreation Zone, then west again to reach the Workshop. But the user is at the Kitchenette now, and the exit to the east is unguarded. So the next step should be to go east to the Recreation Zone, then west again to the Workshop. But the user's last action was going west, so maybe they need to go east now. 

Wait, the user is in the Kitchenette, and the possible exits are east and west. The user's previous steps were: Lounge (north) -> Recreation Zone (west) -> Kitchenette (west) -> Recreation Zone (east) -> Kitchenette (west). So they're looping between the two. The chocolate is in the workshop, which is probably east of the Recreation Zone. But the user hasn't gone east from the Recreation Zone yet. So maybe from the Recreation Zone, going east would lead to the workshop. But the user is currently in the Kitchenette. So the correct path is: from Kitchenette, go east to Recreation Zone, then west to the Workshop. But the user needs to go west from the Recreation Zone to reach the Workshop. Wait, the initial instruction says after going north, go west, then take a trip west. So maybe the Workshop is west of the Recreation Zone. But the user is in the Kitchenette, which is connected to the Recreation Zone. So the user needs to go east from Kitchenette to Recreation Zone, then west to the Workshop. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action should be to go east from the Kitchenette to the Recreation Zone, then west again to reach the Workshop.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text adventure game. The goal is to pick up the chocolate bar from the workshop and win. Let me recap the journey so far.

Starting in the Lounge, they went north to the Recreation Zone, then west to the Kitchenette, east back to Recreation Zone, west again to Kitchenette, and now back in Recreation Zone again. The game seems to be looping between these areas. The original instructions mentioned going north, then west, then west again, and picking up the chocolate in the workshop.

Wait, the user has been moving between Recreation Zone and Kitchenette. The workshop hasn't been mentioned yet. Maybe the workshop is another room. The initial prompt said to go north, then west, then west again. But the current location is Recreation Zone. Maybe the workshop is east from here? Or perhaps there's a different path.

Looking at the current room description: Recreation Zone has a bookshelf, a bar, and an exit to the south and west. The user needs to get to the workshop. Maybe the workshop is east of the Recreation Zone? But when they tried going east from Kitchenette, they returned to Recreation Zone. Maybe the exit east from Recreation Zone is blocked or leads elsewhere.

Alternatively, maybe the workshop is in the Lounge or another area. The initial instruction said to go north (from Lounge to Recreation Zone), then west (to Kitchenette), then west again. But the user is stuck in a loop. Maybe the correct path is to go south from Recreation Zone? The exit to the south is unguarded. Let me check the previous steps.

Wait, the user's last action was going east from Kitchenette, which brought them back to Recreation Zone. The current room is Recreation Zone again. The exit to the south is there. Maybe the workshop is south of the Recreation Zone? But the initial instruction didn't mention that. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west from Recreation Zone again, but that leads to Kitchenette again.

Hmm, perhaps the user is missing a key step. The original goal was to go north, then west, then west again, then pick up the chocolate in the workshop. But the user has been moving between Recreation Zone and Kitchenette. Maybe the workshop is in the Lounge? But the Lounge was the starting point. Alternatively, maybe the workshop is in the Kitchenette. But the Kitchenette's description mentions a saucepan, but no chocolate.

Wait, the user's task is to pick up the chocolate bar from the floor of the workshop. So the workshop must be a room that hasn't been explored yet. The current path has the user looping between Recreation Zone and Kitchenette. Maybe the workshop is east of the Recreation Zone. Let me check the directions again.

In the Recreation Zone, the exits are south and west. The user tried going west to Kitchenette, then east back. Maybe the correct path is to go south from Recreation Zone. But the south exit is unguarded. Let me think: the initial steps were go north (to Recreation Zone), then west (to Kitchenette), then west again (but that's not possible, since from Kitchenette, west leads back to Recreation Zone). Wait, maybe the user needs to go east from Recreation Zone to reach the workshop. But the Recreation Zone's east exit wasn't mentioned before. Wait, in the Kitchenette, the user was told to try going east (which led back to Recreation Zone). Maybe the workshop is east of the Recreation Zone. But the user hasn't tried that yet.

Wait, in the Recreation Zone description, the user is told to try going west. But maybe there's an exit east that wasn't mentioned. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go south from Recreation Zone. Let me check the previous steps again.

The user is in Recreation Zone again. The exits are south and west. The user needs to find the workshop. Maybe the workshop is south of Recreation Zone. But the user hasn't tried that yet. The initial instructions said to go north, then west, then west. But perhaps the workshop is in a different direction. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east from Recreation Zone, but that's not mentioned. Wait, in the Kitchenette, the user was told to try going east, which led back to Recreation Zone. Maybe the workshop is east of the Recreation Zone. But how to get there?

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go west from the Kitchenette again, but that's not possible. Wait, the user is in Recreation Zone, and the exit to the south is there. Maybe the workshop is south of Recreation Zone. Let me think: the user needs to go south from Recreation Zone. But the initial instructions didn't mention that. However, the user's task is to reach the workshop. So perhaps the correct next step is to go south from Recreation Zone. But the user has been stuck in a loop. Maybe that's the way to go.

So, the next action should be to go south from the Recreation Zone. That would be the next step.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and eventually pick up a chocolate bar from the workshop. The goal is to go north, then west, then west again, and pick up the chocolate.

So far, the user has been moving between the Lounge, Recreation Zone, Kitchenette, and back to the Lounge. They've tried going north, west, east, and south, but they haven't found the workshop yet. The current room is the Lounge again, with an open portal east and a gate west. The user is at room 7, which is the Lounge.

The original task mentioned going north first, then west, then west again. But the user has been moving in a loop between the Lounge and Recreation Zone. Maybe they need to find a different path. Wait, in the Lounge, there's an open portal east. Maybe that's a different route. But the user's previous moves have been going west and south, which might not be leading them towards the workshop.

Alternatively, maybe the workshop is in a different area. The user needs to pick up the chocolate bar from the workshop's floor. So far, they haven't encountered any chocolate or a workshop. The Recreation Zone has a bar, but it's empty. The Kitchenette has a saucepan, but it's empty. The Lounge has a bed, but nothing else.

Perhaps the user needs to go east from the Lounge through the portal. Let me check the previous steps. When they were in the Lounge, the exit to the east is a portal. Maybe that leads to a different area. The user's last action was going south from the Recreation Zone back to the Lounge. Now, in the Lounge, the options are north, east, or west. The user should try going east through the portal to see if that leads them to the workshop. If they go east, maybe they can find the workshop and then proceed to pick up the chocolate. Alternatively, maybe the workshop is in the Recreation Zone or Kitchenette, but those areas haven't had any items yet.

Wait, the original instruction said to go north first, then west, then west again. But the user might be getting stuck in a loop. Maybe they need to go east from the Lounge to find a different path. Let me think: the user is at the Lounge (room 7). The correct path according to the original task is north, then west, then west. But the user has been going west and south, which might not be the right direction. Maybe they need to go north from the Lounge again. But the Lounge's north exit is unguarded. Wait, the Lounge's description says there's an open portal east and an open gate west. So going north from the Lounge might not be possible. Wait, the user's previous action was going south from the Recreation Zone to the Lounge. So in the Lounge, the exits are east and west. The user needs to go north, but maybe that's not possible here. Wait, the initial instruction said to go north first. But in the Lounge, maybe the north exit is blocked. Wait, the initial description of the Lounge says: "You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north." But in the current state, the Lounge has an open portal east and an open gate west. So maybe the north exit is not present here. Wait, maybe the user is moving in a loop and hasn't found the correct path yet. The original goal is to go north, then west, then west again. But the user is stuck in the Lounge. Maybe they need to go east through the portal to reach a different area where the workshop is located. Alternatively, maybe the workshop is in the Recreation Zone or Kitchenette, but the user hasn't found it yet. Since the user hasn't picked up the chocolate bar, they need to find the workshop. The workshop might be in a room that's not yet explored. The user should try going east from the Lounge through the portal to see if that leads them to the workshop. So the next action should be to go east.

You arrive in a cookhouse. A standard kind of place.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game where they have to navigate through different rooms and eventually pick up the chocolate bar from the workshop. The goal is to go north, then west, then west again, and pick up the chocolate.

So far, the user has been moving between the Lounge, Recreation Zone, Kitchenette, and Cookhouse. The current room is the Cookhouse. The directions mentioned here are west, north, and south. The user's previous actions have been going east and west, which has led them back through some rooms.

The challenge here is to figure out the correct path to reach the workshop where the chocolate bar is. The user needs to go north, then west, then west again. But in the Cookhouse, the available exits are west, north, and south. So maybe going north from here would take them to a new area. But the user has to make sure they're following the correct sequence of moves.

Wait, the original instructions said: first go north, then attempt to go west, then take a trip west. So maybe after going north once, they need to go west twice. But in the current room (Cookhouse), going north might lead them to a different area. Let me check the previous rooms. The user was in the Lounge, then Recreation Zone, Kitchenette, Cookhouse. So maybe the Cookhouse is part of the path leading to the workshop.

Alternatively, maybe the user is stuck in a loop between the Cookhouse and other rooms. The user needs to find the right path to reach the workshop. Since the goal is to pick up the chocolate bar from the workshop, the user must be near that room.

In the Cookhouse, the exits are west, north, and south. If the user goes north from here, they might reach a room that's closer to the workshop. Alternatively, going south might lead them back to the Lounge, which they've already been in. But the user needs to go west twice after going north once. So perhaps from the Cookhouse, going north would be the next step, then west twice to reach the workshop.

So the next action should be to go north from the Cookhouse. That makes sense because the user needs to go north first, then west twice. So the correct next move is north.

Okay, let's try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text adventure game, and the goal is to pick up the chocolate bar from the workshop and win. Let me recap the journey so far.

Starting in the Lounge, they went north to the Recreation Zone, then west to the Kitchenette, east back to Recreation Zone, west again to Kitchenette, east to Recreation Zone, south to Lounge, east to Cookhouse, north to Office. Now, in the Office, there's an exit to the south. The user is supposed to reach the workshop, get the chocolate bar, and win.

Looking at the previous rooms, the Workshop hasn't been mentioned yet. The user has been moving between rooms but hasn't found the Workshop. The goal is to get to the Workshop's floor where the chocolate bar is. So far, the user has been moving in a loop between Lounge, Recreation Zone, Kitchenette, Cookhouse, Office. Maybe they need to find a different path.

In the Office, the only exit mentioned is south, which leads back to the Lounge. But the Workshop isn't in the current rooms. Maybe the Workshop is in a different direction. Let me check the previous rooms again. The Lounge had a portal east to Cookhouse and a gate west. The Cookhouse had a portal west and exits north and south. The Office is north of the Cookhouse. Maybe the Workshop is in the Cookhouse or another room.

Wait, the user's goal is to go west from the Lounge, then west again, then west again? Or maybe the Workshop is in a different location. Alternatively, maybe the chocolate bar is in the Kitchenette or another room. But the user hasn't found it yet.

Alternatively, perhaps the user needs to go east from the Office. But the Office only has a south exit. Wait, the Office's description says there's an unguarded exit to the south. So going south from Office would take them back to Lounge. But the Workshop hasn't been encountered yet. Maybe the Workshop is in the Cookhouse? Let me check the Cookhouse description again. The Cookhouse has a portal west leading back to the Kitchenette, and exits north and south. The Office is north of the Cookhouse. Maybe the Workshop is in the Kitchenette? But the Kitchenette's description mentions a saucepan and a cabinet, but no chocolate bar.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west from the Cookhouse. Wait, in the Cookhouse, the user can go west to the Kitchenette, but that's where they were before. Maybe the Workshop is in the Recreation Zone? But the Recreation Zone has a bar and a bookshelf, but no chocolate.

Hmm, perhaps the user is missing a key step. The original instructions said: after going west from the Lounge, then west again, then west again. But the user has been moving in a loop. Maybe the Workshop is in a different direction. Alternatively, maybe the chocolate bar is in the Office? But the Office's description doesn't mention it.

Wait, the user's goal is to pick up the chocolate bar from the floor of the workshop. So the Workshop must be a room that hasn't been visited yet. The user has been in Lounge, Recreation Zone, Kitchenette, Cookhouse, Office. The Workshop is probably in one of these rooms, but the descriptions don't mention it. Maybe the user needs to explore more.

In the Office, the only exit is south. So going back to Lounge. From Lounge, the user can go east to Cookhouse or west to the gate. Maybe the Workshop is in the Cookhouse. Let me check the Cookhouse again. The Cookhouse is described as a standard place with a chair. No mention of a workshop. Maybe the user needs to go east from the Cookhouse? But the Cookhouse has a portal west and exits north and south. The Office is north, and the Kitchenette is west.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east from the Office, but there's no exit mentioned. The Office only has a south exit. So perhaps the user is stuck in a loop and needs to find another path. Maybe the Workshop is in the Recreation Zone? But the Recreation Zone's description doesn't mention it.

Wait, the initial instruction said: after going west from the Lounge, then west again, then west again. But the user has been going west from Lounge to Kitchenette, then east to Recreation Zone, then west again to Kitchenette, etc. Maybe the Workshop is in the Kitchenette? But the Kitchenette's description doesn't mention a chocolate bar.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east from the Office to find the Workshop. But the Office's description says there's an exit to the south only. So perhaps the user is missing something. Maybe the chocolate bar is in the Office, but the description doesn't say that. Or maybe the user needs to look for it in the current room.

Wait, the user is in the Office now. The Office's description says there's an unguarded exit to the south. The user's next action should be to go south back to the Lounge. But that's where they were before. Maybe the Workshop is in the Lounge? But the Lounge has a bed and a portal east and gate west. No mention of a workshop.

This is confusing. The user needs to find the Workshop and pick up the chocolate bar. Maybe the Workshop is in the Cookhouse. Let me check again. The Cookhouse is described as a standard place with a chair. No mention of a workshop. Maybe the user needs to explore more. But the user has been moving between rooms without finding it.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west from the Office, but there's no exit mentioned. The Office only has a south exit. So perhaps the user is stuck. But the original goal is to go west from the Lounge, then west again, then west again. Maybe the user needs to go west three times from the Lounge. Let me check the initial steps.

Original steps: go north from Lounge, then west, then west again. But the user has been going back and forth. Maybe the Workshop is in the third west from Lounge. Let me think: Lounge -> Recreation Zone (west from Lounge?), but the Lounge has a gate west. Wait, the initial description of the Lounge says: "There is an open portal leading east. There is an open gate leading west. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north." So the user first went north from Lounge. Then, in Recreation Zone, the user went west to Kitchenette. Then east back to Recreation Zone, then west to Kitchenette again. Then east to Recreation Zone, south to Lounge, east to Cookhouse, north to Office.

So the user hasn't gone west from the Lounge again. Maybe the Workshop is in the west direction from Lounge. But the Lounge's west is a gate. Going west from Lounge would take them to the Recreation Zone? Wait, no. The Lounge's west is a gate, but the initial movement was north. Maybe the user needs to go west from the Lounge, but the initial instruction said to go north first. But the user is now in the Office, and the only exit is south. So perhaps the user needs to go back to Lounge, then west, then west again, then west again.

But the user is in the Office. The only exit is south to Lounge. So the next step is to go south to Lounge. Then, from Lounge, go west to the gate. But the Lounge's west is a gate. Then, from there, maybe go west again. But the user has to find the Workshop. Maybe the Workshop is in the west direction from the Lounge. But the initial steps didn't mention it. Maybe the user needs to explore that path.

So the next action would be to go south from Office to Lounge, then west from Lounge to the gate, then west again to the Workshop. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next step is to go south from Office to Lounge, then west. But the user is in the Office, so the next command is go south.

Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game where they have to navigate through different rooms and find a chocolate bar. The goal is to go north, then west, and finally pick up the chocolate in the workshop.

Looking at the history of commands, the user has been moving between rooms: starting in the Lounge, then Recreation Zone, Kitchenette, back to Recreation Zone, Lounge again, Cookhouse, Office, and back to Cookhouse. The current room is Cookhouse, and the possible exits are west, north, or south. The user's last action was going south, which brought them back to Cookhouse.

The challenge here is to determine the next correct move. The original plan was to go north from the Lounge, then west to the workshop. But the user has been looping between rooms. The key is to find the workshop where the chocolate is located. The Cookhouse might be part of the path leading to the workshop. Since the user is in the Cookhouse, maybe the next step is to go west, as the portal is mentioned there. Alternatively, going north or south might lead to other areas. But the user needs to reach the workshop, so checking the directions again: the Cookhouse has a portal west and exits north and south. If the workshop is west of the Cookhouse, then going west would be the right move. However, the user has already been to the Lounge and Recreation Zone, so maybe the workshop is in a different direction. Alternatively, the user might need to go north from the Cookhouse to reach the workshop. But the previous steps suggest that the user is moving in a loop. The correct path might be to go west from the Cookhouse to reach the workshop where the chocolate is. So the next action should be go west.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game where they have to navigate through different rooms and eventually pick up the chocolate bar. The goal is to go north, then west, and then get the chocolate in the workshop.

Looking at the current room, it's the Lounge again. The user has been moving between rooms, going north, west, east, south, and back. The current room has a bed, a portal east, a gate west, and a suggestion to go north again. 

The user's previous actions have been moving west and east, but they haven't found the chocolate bar yet. The challenge is to figure out the correct path to reach the workshop where the chocolate is. The user might be stuck in a loop between the Lounge, Recreation Zone, Kitchenette, and Cookhouse. 

The key is to find the right sequence of moves that leads to the workshop. Since the initial instructions mention going north, then west, then west again, maybe the user needs to go west from the Lounge. But the Lounge's west gate leads back to the previous room. Wait, in the last step, the user was in the Lounge and went west, which led back to the same place. Maybe the correct path is to go east from the Lounge through the portal, then find another exit.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go north from the Lounge again, but the Lounge's north exit is unguarded. However, the user has already been there. Maybe the workshop is in a different direction. Let me check the previous steps again.

The user started at the Lounge, went north to Recreation Zone, then west to Kitchenette, east back to Recreation Zone, south to Lounge, east to Cookhouse, north to Office, south back to Cookhouse, west to Lounge. It seems like they're looping between Lounge and Cookhouse. The chocolate is in the workshop, which might be east of the Lounge via the portal. But the user hasn't gone east from the Lounge yet. Wait, in the first move, they went north from the Lounge. Maybe the correct path is to go east from the Lounge through the portal, then proceed further.

But the current room is the Lounge again, and the user is at step 11. The goal is to reach the workshop. The user needs to find the correct path to the workshop. Since the initial instructions said to go north, then west, then west again, maybe the user needs to go west from the Lounge, but that leads back. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east from the Lounge through the portal, then proceed north or south.

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go west from the Lounge, but that's a gate, not a portal. The Lounge has an open portal east and a gate west. The user might need to go east through the portal to reach a new area. But in the previous steps, going east from the Lounge led to the Cookhouse. Maybe the workshop is in a different direction. 

Wait, the original goal was to go north, then west, then west again. The user has been going back and forth. Maybe the correct path is to go west from the Lounge, then proceed further. But the Lounge's west gate leads to the previous room, which is the Kitchenette. Then from there, going east again. But the user hasn't found the chocolate yet. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go north from the Lounge again, but that's the Recreation Zone. The user might need to find the correct sequence of moves to reach the workshop. Since the user is stuck in a loop, the next step should be to go east from the Lounge through the portal to Cookhouse, then north to Office, then south back to Cookhouse, then west to Lounge again. This seems like a loop. Maybe the user needs to go east from the Lounge, then north, then west, then west again. But the user hasn't found the chocolate yet. 

Wait, the original task was to go north, then west, then west again, then pick up the chocolate. The user has been moving around, but hasn't reached the workshop. The chocolate is in the workshop, which is probably in a room that's west of the Lounge. But the Lounge's west gate leads to the Kitchenette, which is part of the loop. Maybe the user needs to go west from the Lounge, then west again, but that's not possible. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east from the Lounge through the portal, then north to the Office, then south to Cookhouse, then west to Lounge, then east again. This seems like a loop. The user might need to find a different path. 

Since the user is in the Lounge again, the next action should be to go east through the portal, then proceed further. The user's previous steps have not yet reached the workshop, so the correct move is to go east from the Lounge.

Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game where they have to navigate through different rooms and eventually pick up a chocolate bar from a workshop. The goal is to reach the workshop and get the chocolate.

Looking at the history of commands, the user has been moving around between rooms like the Lounge, Recreation Zone, Kitchenette, Cookhouse, and Office. They've been going back and forth between these areas, sometimes repeating the same paths. The challenge is to find the right path to the workshop without getting stuck in loops.

The current room is the Cookhouse, and the available exits are west, north, and south. The user's previous actions have included going east, west, north, and south, which suggests they might be retracing their steps. The key here is to remember the original instruction: after traveling north, then west, then west again, pick up the chocolate bar from the workshop.

Wait, the initial task was to go north, then west, then west again. But in the current state, the user is in the Cookhouse. Maybe the workshop is in a different part of the map. Let me check the previous rooms. The Lounge had a portal east and gate west. The Recreation Zone had exits south and west. The Kitchenette had east and west. The Office had a south exit.

Perhaps the workshop is in the Office or another room. But the user hasn't found the chocolate yet. The original goal was to pick up the chocolate bar from the floor of the workshop. So maybe the workshop is in the Office or another room that hasn't been explored yet.

Wait, in the Office, there's an exit to the south, which leads back to the Cookhouse. The Cookhouse has a portal west leading back to the Lounge. The Lounge has a portal east to the Recreation Zone. The Recreation Zone has a south exit to the Lounge again. The Kitchenette is connected to the Recreation Zone and Cookhouse.

Hmm, maybe the workshop is in the Office. The user is currently in the Cookhouse, and the Office is north of the Cookhouse. So if they go north from the Cookhouse, they can reach the Office. Then, from the Office, maybe there's a way to get to the workshop. But the Office only has a south exit back to the Cookhouse. Wait, the Office's description says there's an unguarded exit to the south. So maybe the workshop is in the Office, but the user hasn't checked there yet.

Alternatively, maybe the workshop is in the Kitchenette or another room. But the user hasn't found the chocolate yet. The chocolate is supposed to be on the floor of the workshop. So the user needs to find the workshop room and pick up the chocolate.

Looking back, the user's last action was going east from the Cookhouse, which led them back to the Lounge. But the Lounge doesn't mention a workshop. The Recreation Zone, Kitchenette, and Office have been explored, but the workshop hasn't been found yet.

Wait, maybe the workshop is in the Office. The user is in the Cookhouse, and the Office is north. So the next step would be to go north from the Cookhouse to the Office. Then, check if the workshop is there. But the Office's description doesn't mention a workshop. However, the original goal was to reach the workshop. So maybe the workshop is in the Office, and the user needs to look around there.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west from the Cookhouse to the Lounge, then east to the Recreation Zone, then west again to the Kitchenette, and then find the workshop. But that seems like a loop.

Wait, the initial instructions said: after going north, then west, then west again, pick up the chocolate. So maybe the path is: start at Lounge, go north to Recreation Zone, then west to Kitchenette, then west again to... but the Kitchenette's west exit leads back to the Recreation Zone. Hmm, maybe the workshop is in the Office, and the user needs to get there through the Office's north exit.

But the user is currently in the Cookhouse. The Cookhouse has a north exit. So the next step should be to go north to the Office. Then, from the Office, maybe there's a way to get to the workshop. But the Office's description doesn't mention a workshop. However, the user's goal is to pick up the chocolate from the workshop. So maybe the workshop is in the Office, and the user needs to check there.

Alternatively, maybe the workshop is in the Lounge. But the Lounge's description doesn't mention a workshop. The user needs to find the correct path. Since the user has been looping between rooms, perhaps they need to go north from the Cookhouse to the Office, then check if there's a workshop there. If not, maybe go west from the Cookhouse to the Lounge, then east to the Recreation Zone, then west to the Kitchenette, and then check there.

But the user's last action was going east from the Cookhouse, which led them back to the Lounge. The current room is the Cookhouse again. So the next step should be to go north to the Office. Then, from the Office, check if the workshop is there. If not, maybe go south back to the Cookhouse, then west to the Lounge, and so on.

Alternatively, maybe the workshop is in the Kitchenette. The user has been in the Kitchenette before. The Kitchenette has a saucepan, but no mention of a chocolate bar. The user needs to find the workshop. Since the original goal is to pick up the chocolate from the workshop, the user must find the workshop room.

Given that the user is in the Cookhouse, the next logical step is to go north to the Office. Then, check if the workshop is there. If not, maybe go west from the Cookhouse to the Lounge, then east to the Recreation Zone, then west to the Kitchenette, and then check again.

But the user's previous steps have been going back and forth, so maybe they need to try a different path. The key is to find the workshop. Since the user hasn't found it yet, they need to explore all possible paths. The next step is to go north from the Cookhouse to the Office. Then, from the Office, check if the workshop is there. If not, proceed further.

Okay, let's try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game where they have to navigate through different rooms and find a chocolate bar. The goal is to go north, then west, then west again, and pick up the chocolate in the workshop.

Looking at the history of movements: the player started in the Lounge, went north to Recreation Zone, then west to Kitchenette, east back to Recreation Zone, south to Lounge, east to Cookhouse, north to Office, south back to Cookhouse, west to Lounge, east to Cookhouse again, and north to Office. It seems like they're moving in a loop between these areas without making progress toward the workshop where the chocolate is.

The original instructions mentioned that after going west twice, they should pick up the chocolate in the workshop. But the current rooms they're in (Cookhouse, Office, Lounge) don't mention a workshop. Maybe the workshop is a different room that hasn't been visited yet. Alternatively, perhaps the chocolate is in the Kitchenette or another room they've passed through but not checked properly.

Wait, in the Kitchenette, there's a saucepan, but it's empty. The player hasn't looked for items there. Maybe the chocolate is in the Kitchenette, but the player hasn't checked it. However, the original goal was to go west twice from the Lounge, which led to the Kitchenette, then maybe another west to the workshop. But in the current path, the player is looping between rooms without reaching the workshop.

Alternatively, maybe the workshop is the Cookhouse, and the chocolate is there. But the Cookhouse description doesn't mention a chocolate bar. The player needs to check each room for items. Since the user is stuck in a loop, they might need to explore different directions again, perhaps checking the Kitchenette or another room for the chocolate.

But according to the game's feedback, the player is at 0/13, which might indicate that they haven't found the chocolate yet. The next step should be to check the rooms they've already been in for the chocolate, maybe the Kitchenette or the Recreation Zone. However, the game's current room is the Office, so the next action should be to go south back to Cookhouse, then check west again, or perhaps go east to the Lounge and then check the bed or other items.

But the user's last action was going north to Office, so the next step should be to go south back to Cookhouse. Then check west again, which might lead to the workshop where the chocolate is. Alternatively, maybe the chocolate is in the Kitchenette, and the player needs to go back there. But the player hasn't picked it up yet. So the correct next action is to go south from Office to Cookhouse, then west to the workshop, and then pick up the chocolate.

Okay, let's try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game where they have to navigate through different rooms and eventually pick up a chocolate bar from a workshop. The goal is to reach the workshop and get the chocolate.

Looking at the history of movements, the player has been moving between rooms like Lounge, Recreation Zone, Kitchenette, Cookhouse, and Office. The directions they've taken so far include north, west, east, south, and back again. The challenge seems to be navigating through these rooms without getting stuck in loops.

The current room is the Cookhouse, and the available exits are west, north, and south. The user has been repeatedly going back and forth between the Cookhouse, Lounge, and Office. The problem might be that the player hasn't found the workshop yet. The original task mentioned going to the west after moving north, then west again to pick up the chocolate.

Wait, the initial instructions said: "First of all, you could, like, travel north. And then, attempt to go to the west. With that accomplished, take a trip west. If you can do that, pick up the chocolate bar from the floor of the workshop. And if you do that, you're the winner!"

So the path should be: start in Lounge, go north to Recreation Zone, then west to Kitchenette, then east to Recreation Zone again? Wait, but the user has already gone through several loops. Maybe the workshop is in a different direction. Alternatively, maybe the player needs to find a specific path that leads to the workshop.

Looking at the current position in Cookhouse, the exits are west, north, south. The user has been going back and forth. Maybe the workshop is in the north or west direction from Cookhouse. But in the previous steps, going north from Cookhouse led to Office, then south back to Cookhouse. Maybe the workshop is in the west direction from Cookhouse? Let me check the previous rooms.

When the user was in the Lounge, there's an open portal east and gate west. Going west from Lounge leads back to the previous rooms. Maybe the workshop is in the west direction from somewhere else. Alternatively, perhaps the player needs to find a specific room where the chocolate is located.

Alternatively, maybe the player is stuck in a loop and needs to find a different path. The user has been going back and forth between Cookhouse, Office, and Lounge. The chocolate is in the workshop, so maybe the player needs to find the workshop room. The initial instructions mention going west after moving north, then taking a trip west again. Maybe the workshop is in the west direction from the Recreation Zone or another room.

Alternatively, perhaps the player needs to go west from the Lounge, but that leads back to the previous rooms. Maybe the workshop is in the Kitchenette? But the Kitchenette didn't have the chocolate. The user needs to pick up the chocolate from the workshop's floor. So the player needs to find the workshop room.

Looking back at the rooms, the Cookhouse has a portal west. Maybe going west from Cookhouse leads to the workshop. But in the previous steps, when the user went west from Cookhouse, they ended up in the Lounge again. Wait, no, when the user was in Cookhouse and went west, they went to Lounge. Then from Lounge, going east leads to Cookhouse again. So maybe the workshop is in a different direction.

Alternatively, maybe the player needs to go north from the Office to reach the workshop. But the Office only has an exit to the south. Hmm. This is confusing. The user might be going in circles, not finding the workshop. The original goal is to reach the workshop and pick up the chocolate. The player needs to find the correct path that leads to the workshop.

Alternatively, maybe the workshop is in the Recreation Zone. But the Recreation Zone didn't have the chocolate. The user needs to check each room for the chocolate. But the initial instructions said the chocolate is in the workshop's floor. So the player needs to find the workshop room.

Given the current position in Cookhouse, the exits are west (Lounge), north (Office), and south (back to previous rooms). Maybe the player needs to go north to Office, then south again to Cookhouse, then west to Lounge, then east to Cookhouse again. This loop isn't helping. Maybe the workshop is in a different direction. Alternatively, maybe the player needs to go west from the Lounge, but that leads back to the same area.

Wait, the initial steps were: go north from Lounge to Recreation Zone, then west to Kitchenette, then east back to Recreation Zone. Maybe the workshop is in the west direction from the Kitchenette? But the Kitchenette's exits are east and west. Going west from Kitchenette leads back to Cookhouse. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the player needs to go west from the Recreation Zone. But the Recreation Zone's exit is south and west. Going west from Recreation Zone leads to Kitchenette. Then from Kitchenette, west leads to Cookhouse. This seems like a loop again.

I think the key is to find the workshop room. The user needs to navigate to the workshop, which is mentioned in the initial task. The chocolate is in the workshop's floor. So the player must find the workshop. The path might involve going west from the Lounge, but that leads to the same rooms. Maybe the workshop is in the Office? But the Office only has an exit to the south. Alternatively, maybe the workshop is in the Cookhouse. But the Cookhouse didn't have the chocolate.

Wait, the user's last action was going north from Cookhouse to Office, then south back to Cookhouse. The user is stuck in a loop. The only way out is to find the workshop. Maybe the workshop is in the west direction from the Lounge, but that's already been checked. Alternatively, maybe the player needs to go east from the Lounge to the portal, but that's the Cookhouse again.

This is tricky. The user needs to find the workshop. Maybe the workshop is in the Recreation Zone, but the Recreation Zone didn't have the chocolate. The initial instructions said to go west after moving north, then take a trip west again. So maybe from the Recreation Zone, going west leads to the workshop. But in the Recreation Zone, the exits are south and west. Going west from Recreation Zone leads to Kitchenette. Then from Kitchenette, west leads to Cookhouse. Then from Cookhouse, west leads to Lounge. This seems like a loop.

Wait, maybe the workshop is in the Lounge? But the Lounge has a bed, but no chocolate. The initial task says the chocolate is in the workshop's floor. So the workshop must be a different room. Maybe the player needs to go east from the Lounge to the portal, which is Cookhouse, then north to Office, then south back to Cookhouse, then west to Lounge again. This isn't working.

Alternatively, maybe the player needs to go west from the Office. But the Office only has an exit to the south. So that's not possible. I'm stuck. The user needs to find the workshop. Maybe the workshop is in the Kitchenette? But the Kitchenette didn't have the chocolate. The user needs to check each room for the chocolate. But the initial instructions say the chocolate is in the workshop's floor. So the player must find the workshop.

Given the current position in Cookhouse, the player needs to try going west again, but that leads back to Lounge. Maybe the workshop is in the Lounge? But the Lounge doesn't have the chocolate. Alternatively, maybe the player needs to go north from the Office to reach the workshop, but the Office only has a south exit. This is confusing.

Perhaps the player is supposed to go west from the Lounge, but that leads to the same rooms. Maybe the workshop is in the west direction from the Recreation Zone. But the Recreation Zone's west exit leads to Kitchenette. Then from Kitchenette, west leads to Cookhouse. Then from Cookhouse, west leads to Lounge. This loop isn't helping. The user needs to find the workshop. Maybe the workshop is in the Office? But the Office only has a south exit. I'm not sure. The user might need to try going west from the Cookhouse again, but that's already been done. Maybe the answer is to go west from the Cookhouse, but that leads back to Lounge. I'm stuck. The user needs to find the workshop, but the path isn't clear. Maybe the correct path is to go west from the Lounge, then east to Cookhouse, then north to Office, then south back to Cookhouse, then west to Lounge again. This loop is not working. I think the user needs to find the workshop through a different route, but the current path isn't leading there. Maybe the workshop is in the Recreation Zone, but the user hasn't checked that room for the chocolate. Wait, the Recreation Zone has a bar, but it's empty. The chocolate is in the workshop's floor. So the player needs to find the workshop. Maybe the workshop is in the Office? But the Office only has a south exit. I'm not sure. The user needs to continue moving through the rooms until they find the workshop.

<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game where they have to navigate through different rooms and eventually find a chocolate bar. The goal is to go north, then west, and then pick up the chocolate in the workshop.

Looking at the history of commands, the user has been moving between rooms like Lounge, Recreation Zone, Kitchenette, Cookhouse, and Office. They've been going back and forth between these areas, sometimes repeating the same paths. The current room is the Lounge again, with the same description as before. The user is told to try going north from here.

But wait, the original task was to first go north, then west, then west again to reach the workshop. However, the user has been moving in a loop between Lounge, Recreation Zone, Kitchenette, Cookhouse, and Office. It seems like they might be stuck in a cycle without progressing towards the workshop.

The key here is to check if the user has already reached the workshop. The original instruction mentioned that after going west, they should pick up the chocolate bar from the workshop. But in the current state, the user is in the Lounge again, which suggests they might not have found the workshop yet.

So, the next logical step would be to continue moving west from the Lounge, as per the initial plan. The Lounge has an open gate leading west, so going west from here might take them to the next part of the maze. However, the user has been going back and forth, so maybe they need to find a different path or check if the workshop is in a different direction.

Alternatively, maybe the workshop is in the Office or Cookhouse, but the user hasn't checked those areas thoroughly. However, the instructions specify that after going north and then west, they should go west again to reach the workshop. So following that path strictly is important.

Given that the user is at the Lounge and the next suggested action is to go north, but the initial plan was to go north first, then west. However, the user has already gone north once and then west, but maybe they need to go west again from the Lounge. Wait, the Lounge has a gate leading west, so going west from Lounge might be the next step. But the user's last action was going east to the Cookhouse, then north to the Office, then south back to Cookhouse, then west to Lounge again.

So, the user might need to go west from the Lounge to proceed further. But the Lounge's description says there's an open portal east and a gate west. So going west from Lounge would take them to the next room, which might be the workshop. However, the user hasn't picked up the chocolate yet, so they need to make sure they're in the right place.

In the initial instructions, the user was told to go north, then west, then west again. But in the current state, the user is in the Lounge, and the next step should be to go west. However, the user's previous actions have them looping between rooms. So the correct next action is to go west from the Lounge to proceed towards the workshop where the chocolate is located.

<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and find a chocolate bar in a workshop. The goal is to reach the workshop, pick up the chocolate bar, and win.

Looking at the current scenario, the user is in the Sauna room. The description mentions a counter that's empty, an open gate leading east, and exits to the south and west. The previous movements have been oscillating between the Lounge, Recreation Zone, Kitchenette, Cookhouse, Office, and back to Lounge and Sauna. It seems like the player is moving in a loop, possibly not following the correct path to the workshop.

The original task was to go north from the Lounge, then west, then west again, and finally pick up the chocolate bar. But the player has been going back and forth between rooms without seeming to progress towards the workshop. The Sauna is a new room, and the exits here are south and west. The user might need to check if the workshop is in a different direction or if there's a specific path that leads there.

Since the user is in the Sauna, the next step would be to check the available exits. The options are east, south, or west. The previous steps suggest that moving west might lead back to the Lounge, which has been a recurring room. However, the workshop hasn't been encountered yet. Maybe the workshop is in the east direction from the Sauna? But the Sauna's east exit is a gate, which might not be unguarded. Alternatively, the south exit could lead to another room that's part of the path to the workshop.

But the user's goal is to reach the workshop and pick up the chocolate bar. So, the correct path might involve moving east from the Sauna to reach the workshop. However, the Sauna's east exit is described as a gate, which might be a different room. Alternatively, the workshop could be in the south direction. But the user needs to find the right path without getting stuck in loops.

Given that the user has been moving west and east repeatedly, maybe the workshop is in the south direction from the Sauna. However, the Sauna's south exit is unguarded, so moving south could be the next step. But the user needs to ensure that they are moving towards the workshop. Alternatively, the workshop might be in the east direction, but the user needs to check if that's the case.

Since the user's previous actions have not led them to the workshop, it's possible that the correct path is to go east from the Sauna. However, the Sauna's east exit is a gate, which might be a different room. Alternatively, the user might need to go west from the Sauna to the Lounge again and then try a different direction.

But the user's goal is to reach the workshop, so the next logical step would be to check the exits from the Sauna. The user is in the Sauna, and the exits are east, south, and west. The user needs to choose the correct direction that leads towards the workshop. Since the workshop hasn't been encountered yet, the user might need to explore the east or south directions.

Given the previous movements, the user might need to go east from the Sauna to proceed further. However, the user should check if that's the correct path. Alternatively, moving south from the Sauna might lead to a room that's part of the workshop's path.

In conclusion, the next action should be to go east from the Sauna to check if that leads to the workshop or another room that's part of the correct path.

<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text adventure game, and their goal is to pick up the chocolate bar from the workshop and win. Let me recap the journey so far.

Starting in the Lounge, they went north to the Recreation Zone, then west to the Kitchenette, east back to Recreation Zone, south to the Lounge again, then east to the Cookhouse. From there, they went north to the Office, south back to Cookhouse, west to Lounge, east to Sauna, then back to Lounge.

Now, they're in the Lounge again (0/17). The prompt mentions that the original goal was to go north, then west, then west again, pick up the chocolate bar. But so far, the user has been moving between different rooms without finding the chocolate bar. The current location is the Lounge, which hasn't mentioned any chocolate bar. The Sauna was visited, but it had an empty counter. The Cookhouse and Office didn't have any mention of a chocolate bar either.

Wait, the original instructions said: "pick up the chocolate bar from the floor of the workshop." So the workshop must be a room that hasn't been visited yet. The user has been moving through Lounge, Recreation Zone, Kitchenette, Cookhouse, Office, Sauna. The workshop isn't listed here. Maybe the workshop is another room that's part of the map but not yet explored.

Looking at the current room, the Lounge has an open portal east and a gate west. The user has been going back and forth between Lounge, Recreation Zone, Kitchenette, etc. But the workshop isn't in the current rooms. The user needs to find the workshop to get the chocolate bar.

But how? The user's actions so far have been moving east and west, but maybe they need to go north from the Lounge to reach the workshop. The initial instruction said to go north first, then west. But in the first move, the user went north from Lounge to Recreation Zone. Maybe the workshop is in a different direction. Alternatively, maybe the workshop is in the Office or Cookhouse, but those rooms didn't mention a chocolate bar.

Wait, the user is at Lounge (0/17). The previous steps showed that going north from Lounge leads to Recreation Zone, but maybe the workshop is in a different direction. However, the Lounge's description says there's an open portal east and a gate west. The user has been going west and east, but maybe they need to go north from the Lounge to reach the workshop. But in the initial steps, going north from Lounge led to Recreation Zone, not the workshop.

Alternatively, maybe the workshop is in the Office or Cookhouse. But the user hasn't found any chocolate bar yet. The chocolate bar is supposed to be on the floor of the workshop. So the user needs to find the workshop room.

Looking back at the previous rooms, the Cookhouse had a chair and an open portal west and exits north and south. The Office had an exit south. The Sauna was visited, but no chocolate bar. The Lounge hasn't had any mention of a chocolate bar either.

Wait, maybe the user is supposed to go west from the Lounge to the gate, but the Lounge's west gate leads to the Sauna? No, the user went west from Lounge to Sauna, then east back to Lounge. So maybe the workshop is in a different direction. Alternatively, maybe the user is missing a key step.

The original goal was: go north, then west, then west again, then pick up the chocolate bar. The user has been going back and forth, but maybe they need to go north from the Lounge to reach the workshop. However, the first move was north to Recreation Zone. Maybe the workshop is in a different part of the map. Alternatively, maybe the user is stuck in a loop and needs to find another path.

Alternatively, perhaps the workshop is in the Office or Cookhouse, but the user hasn't checked those rooms thoroughly. The user needs to explore those rooms again. For example, in the Cookhouse, there's a chair and an open portal west. Maybe the chocolate bar is in the Cookhouse. But the user hasn't picked it up yet.

Wait, the user's current location is the Lounge (0/17). The next step would be to go north again, but that leads to Recreation Zone. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west from the Lounge to the Sauna, then east to the Lounge again. But that's not helping.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east from the Lounge to the portal, but that leads to the Recreation Zone again. Hmm. The user might be missing the correct path to the workshop. Since the original instructions said to go north, then west, then west again, maybe the workshop is in the second west direction from the Lounge. But the user has been going west from the Lounge to Sauna, then east back. Maybe the workshop is in the Recreation Zone or another room.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go north from the Lounge to the Recreation Zone, then west to the Kitchenette, then west again? But the Kitchenette's west exit is to the Cookhouse. Wait, the user has been going back and forth between rooms without finding the workshop. The chocolate bar is in the workshop, so the user needs to find that room.

Perhaps the user needs to go north from the Lounge to the Recreation Zone, then west to the Kitchenette, then north to the Cookhouse, then west to the Lounge again. But that's not leading to the workshop. Maybe the workshop is in the Office? The Office had an exit to the south, which is the Cookhouse. But the user hasn't found the chocolate bar yet.

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go east from the Lounge to the portal, but that's Recreation Zone. Maybe the workshop is in the Office. The user needs to check the Office again. The Office had an unguarded exit to the south, which is the Cookhouse. But the user hasn't checked the Office for the chocolate bar.

Wait, the original goal was to pick up the chocolate bar from the floor of the workshop. The user hasn't found the workshop yet. So the user needs to find the workshop room. The current location is the Lounge, and the user needs to find the path to the workshop. Maybe the workshop is in the Cookhouse or Office. The user needs to explore those rooms again.

But the user is at the Lounge (0/17). The next step would be to go north again, but that's Recreation Zone. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west from the Lounge to the Sauna, then east to the Lounge again. But that's not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go east from the Lounge to the portal, then north to the Recreation Zone, then west to the Kitchenette, then north to the Cookhouse, then west to the Lounge again. But this is just looping.

Wait, the user's current step is at Lounge (0/17). The previous steps show that the user has been moving between rooms without finding the workshop. The chocolate bar is in the workshop, so the user needs to find that room. The user needs to explore all possible paths to find the workshop. Maybe the workshop is in the Office or Cookhouse. The user needs to check those rooms again.

But the user is at the Lounge, so the next action would be to go north, west, or east. The user has been going back and forth, but maybe the correct path is to go north from the Lounge to the Recreation Zone, then west to the Kitchenette, then north to the Cookhouse, then west to the Lounge again. But that's not leading to the workshop.

Alternatively, maybe the workshop is in the Sauna? But the Sauna had an empty counter. The user hasn't found the chocolate bar there.

This is confusing. The user needs to find the workshop room to pick up the chocolate bar. The user's current location is the Lounge, and the next step is to go north, west, or east. The user might need to try a different direction. Since the initial instructions said to go north, then west, then west again, maybe the workshop is in the second west direction from the Lounge.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east from the Lounge to the portal, then north to the Recreation Zone, then west to the Kitchenette, then north to the Cookhouse, then west to the Lounge again. But that's not helping.

I think the user needs to continue exploring the rooms they've already visited to find the workshop. The chocolate bar is in the workshop, so the user needs to find that room. The user might have missed it in previous rooms. For example, in the Cookhouse, there's a chair, but maybe the chocolate bar is there. Or in the Office.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and eventually pick up a chocolate bar from the workshop. The goal is to reach the workshop and get the chocolate.

Looking at the current environment, they're in the Recreation Zone again. The description mentions a bookshelf and a bar, but both are empty. The exits are to the south and west. The user has been moving between rooms, going back and forth between the Lounge, Recreation Zone, Kitchenette, Cookhouse, Office, and Sauna. 

The original task was to travel north, then west, then west again, pick up the chocolate bar in the workshop. But so far, the user hasn't reached the workshop. The current room is Recreation Zone, and the exits are south and west. The user has been going west and east repeatedly, which might be a loop.

Wait, the initial instructions said: first go north, then attempt to go west, then take a trip west. If they can do that, pick up the chocolate. So maybe the workshop is in a room that's accessible via west from somewhere. But the user has been moving around without finding the workshop yet.

In the current room (Recreation Zone), the exit to the west is available. If they go west from here, they might reach the Kitchenette again. But the workshop hasn't been mentioned yet. Maybe the workshop is in the Cookhouse or another room. Alternatively, perhaps the user needs to find a specific path that leads to the workshop.

But the user's actions so far have been moving between rooms without a clear path to the workshop. The chocolate bar is in the workshop, so the user needs to find the workshop. The challenge is to navigate through the rooms without getting stuck in a loop.

The user is currently in the Recreation Zone. The exit to the west is available. If they go west, they might end up in the Kitchenette again. But the workshop hasn't been encountered yet. Maybe the workshop is in the Office or another room. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go north from the Recreation Zone, but the exit to the north is not mentioned here. Wait, in the Recreation Zone, the exit is to the south and west. So going west from here would take them to the Kitchenette, then maybe to the Cookhouse, then to the Office, and so on. But the workshop hasn't been found yet.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east from the Sauna to get back to the Lounge, then north to the Recreation Zone again. But the user has been going back and forth. It's possible that the workshop is in a room that's accessible via the west exit from the Recreation Zone, but the user hasn't checked that yet.

Wait, the user's previous moves included going west from the Lounge to the Recreation Zone, then west again to the Kitchenette, then east back to Recreation Zone, and so on. Maybe the workshop is in the Cookhouse, which is connected to the Recreation Zone via the west exit. But the user hasn't checked that yet.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go north from the Lounge to reach the Recreation Zone, but that's where they are now. The original goal was to go north, then west, then west again. But the user has been moving around without reaching the workshop.

Perhaps the user needs to find a path that leads to the workshop. Since the workshop is mentioned in the initial task, maybe it's in the Cookhouse or the Office. The user needs to explore the rooms more thoroughly. However, the current room is the Recreation Zone, and the exits are south and west. The user should try going west again to check the Kitchenette, then proceed further.

But the user has already been going west and east multiple times. Maybe the workshop is in the Office, but the Office only has an exit to the south. Alternatively, the user might need to go north from the Recreation Zone, but that's not an exit here. Wait, in the Recreation Zone, the exit is to the south and west. So going west from here would take them to the Kitchenette, then to the Cookhouse, then to the Office, then back to the Cookhouse, and so on.

It's possible that the user is stuck in a loop and hasn't found the workshop yet. The chocolate bar is in the workshop, so the user needs to find the workshop. The key is to navigate through the rooms until they reach the workshop. Since the user has been moving between rooms without success, they need to continue exploring until they find the workshop.

In the current room (Recreation Zone), the user should go west to the Kitchenette again. Then proceed further to the Cookhouse, then to the Office, and maybe from there find the workshop. Alternatively, maybe the workshop is in the Lounge, but the Lounge has a portal east and a gate west. But the user hasn't checked that yet.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go north from the Lounge to reach the Recreation Zone, but that's where they are now. The user needs to keep moving west until they find the workshop. Since the initial task mentioned going west twice after going north, maybe the workshop is in a room that's accessible via two west moves from the Lounge.

But the user is currently in the Recreation Zone. The exit to the west is available. So the next step is to go west again to the Kitchenette, then continue exploring. The user needs to keep moving through the rooms until they find the workshop where the chocolate bar is located.

-= Kitchenette =-
You've just walked into a kitchenette.

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a cabinet. You can make out a saucepan. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is navigating through different rooms in this text-based game. The goal is to pick up the chocolate bar from the workshop and win. So far, they've been moving between rooms like the Lounge, Recreation Zone, Kitchenette, Cookhouse, Office, and Sauna. The current location is the Kitchenette, and the next possible moves are east or west.

Looking at the previous steps, the user has been going back and forth between rooms, sometimes repeating paths. The challenge is to find the workshop where the chocolate bar is located. The original instruction mentioned going north, then west, then west again, and finally picking up the chocolate bar. But so far, the user hasn't found it yet.

In the current Kitchenette, the description mentions a cabinet and a saucepan, but nothing about a chocolate bar. The exits are east and west. The user tried going east before, which led them back to the Recreation Zone. Maybe the workshop is in a different direction. Wait, the initial instructions said to go north, then west, then west again. But the user has been moving in a loop between Lounge, Recreation Zone, Kitchenette, and back.

Perhaps the workshop is in the Office or Cookhouse? But in the Office, there's only an exit to the south. The Cookhouse has a portal west and exits north and south. Maybe the chocolate bar is in the Cookhouse? But the user hasn't checked there yet. Alternatively, maybe the workshop is in the Sauna? But the Sauna had an empty counter.

Wait, the original task said to go north, then west, then west again. Let me check the path again. Starting from the Lounge, going north to Recreation Zone, then west to Kitchenette, then west again? But the Kitchenette's west exit leads back to the Cookhouse? Or maybe the user needs to go east from the Kitchenette to the Recreation Zone again. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the chocolate bar is in the Lounge? But the Lounge's description doesn't mention it. The user needs to find the workshop. Maybe the workshop is in the Office? But the Office only has an exit to the south. Wait, the user is currently in the Kitchenette, and the exits are east (to Recreation Zone) and west (to Cookhouse). Maybe the workshop is in the Cookhouse? Let me check the Cookhouse description again. The Cookhouse has a chair and portals west and north/south. No mention of a chocolate bar there.

Wait, the original goal was to pick up the chocolate bar from the floor of the workshop. So the workshop must be a room that the user hasn't checked yet. The user has been moving through various rooms but hasn't found the workshop. Maybe the workshop is in the Office? Or perhaps the user needs to go north from the Cookhouse. Let me think: from the Cookhouse, going north leads to the Office, then south back to Cookhouse. Maybe the workshop is in the Office? But the Office description doesn't mention anything. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west from the Cookhouse to the Lounge again, but that's already been done.

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go east from the Kitchenette to the Recreation Zone, then west again to the Kitchenette, but that's just looping. Maybe the user needs to go south from the Office to the Cookhouse, then west to the Lounge, but that's already been done.

Wait, the user's current location is the Kitchenette. The exits are east (Recreation Zone) and west (Cookhouse). The user tried going east before, which led to Recreation Zone. Maybe the workshop is in the Cookhouse? But the Cookhouse's description doesn't mention a chocolate bar. The user needs to check all rooms thoroughly. Maybe the chocolate bar is in the Lounge? But the Lounge's description doesn't mention it. The Sauna had an empty counter. The Office is empty. The Recreation Zone has an empty bar. The Kitchenette has an empty saucepan. The Cookhouse has a chair. The only place left is the Workshop, which hasn't been mentioned yet. Maybe the user needs to go back to the Lounge and try going north again, but that's already been done.

Wait, the initial instruction said to go north, then west, then west again. The user has been going north from Lounge to Recreation Zone, then west to Kitchenette, then west again to Cookhouse. But the Cookhouse's west exit is to the Lounge again. Maybe the user needs to go east from the Cookhouse to the Office, then south back to Cookhouse, but that's not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe the user is missing a step. The original goal was to go north, then west, then west again, then pick up the chocolate bar. But the user hasn't found the workshop yet. Maybe the workshop is in the Office? But the Office's description doesn't mention it. The user might need to check all rooms again. Alternatively, maybe the chocolate bar is in the Sauna? But the Sauna's counter is empty.

Wait, the user is in the Kitchenette. The exit to the west is the Cookhouse. Maybe the workshop is in the Cookhouse. Let me check the Cookhouse again. The Cookhouse has a chair, but no mention of a chocolate bar. The user needs to look for the workshop. Maybe the workshop is in the Office? But the Office's description doesn't mention it. The user might need to go back to the Lounge and try going east again, but that's the portal. Maybe the user needs to go east from the Lounge to the Sauna, but that's already been done.

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go west from the Kitchenette to the Cookhouse, then north to the Office, then south back to Cookhouse, then west to Lounge, then north again. But this is just looping. The user hasn't found the workshop yet. Maybe the workshop is in the Recreation Zone? But the Recreation Zone's bar is empty. The user needs to find the workshop. Maybe the user is missing a step where the workshop is in the Office, but the description doesn't mention it. Alternatively, maybe the chocolate bar is in the Lounge's bed? But the bed is empty.

Hmm, this is confusing. The user has been moving through rooms but hasn't found the chocolate bar. The original instructions said to go north, then west, then west again. The user has done that, but maybe the workshop is in a different direction. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east from the Kitchenette to the Recreation Zone, then west again to the Kitchenette, but that's not helpful. Maybe the user needs to go south from the Office to the Cookhouse, then west to the Lounge, then north again. But this is just looping.

Wait, the user is in the Kitchenette. The exit to the east is Recreation Zone, and west is Cookhouse. The user tried going east before, which led to Recreation Zone. Maybe the workshop is in the Cookhouse. But the Cookhouse's description doesn't mention it. The user needs to check all rooms again. Maybe the chocolate bar is in the Cookhouse's chair? But the chair is described as empty. The user might need to look for the workshop in another room. Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go east from the Cookhouse to the Office, then south back to Cookhouse, then west to Lounge, then north again. But this is not leading to the chocolate bar.

I think the user might be missing the correct path. The original goal was to go north, then west, then west again. The user has done that, but maybe the workshop is in the Office. However, the Office's description doesn't mention it. The user needs to check the Office again. Maybe the chocolate bar is in the Office. But the Office's description says there's an unguarded exit to the south. The user is currently in the Kitchenette, so going east to Recreation Zone, then west to Kitchenette again. This is not working. Maybe the user needs to go east from the Kitchenette to the Recreation Zone, then west to the Kitchenette, then east again. This is looping. I think the user needs to find the workshop in the Office, but the description doesn't mention it. Maybe the user is supposed to go west from the Cookhouse to the Lounge, then north again. But the Lounge's portal is east. The user might need to go east from the Lounge to the Sauna, then west back to Lounge, then north again. This is not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe the chocolate bar is in the Sauna. The Sauna's counter is empty. The user needs to check all rooms again. Maybe the user is missing the correct path. The original instructions said to go north, then west, then west again. The user has done that, but maybe the workshop is in the Office. The user needs to go from the Office to the Cookhouse, then west to the Lounge, then north again. But this is not leading to the chocolate bar. I'm stuck. Maybe the user needs to go east from the Kitchenette to the Recreation Zone, then west to the Kitchenette again, but that's not helpful. The user is stuck in a loop. Maybe the correct answer is to go west from the Kitchenette to the Cookhouse, then north to the Office, then south back to Cookhouse, then west to Lounge, then north again. But this is not working. The user needs to find the workshop, but it's not in any of the described rooms. Maybe the user is supposed to go east from the Sauna to the Lounge, then north again. But the Lounge's portal is east. I think the user needs to go east from the Sauna to the Lounge, then north again. But the Lounge's portal is east. Maybe the user is supposed to go east from the Lounge to the Sauna, then west back to Lounge, then north again. This is not working. I think the user is missing the correct path, but based on the previous steps, the next action should be to go west from the Kitchenette to the Cookhouse, then north to the Office, then south back to Cookhouse, then west to Lounge, then north again. But the user is in the Kitchenette, so the next step is to go west to the Cookhouse. The user's last action was go east from the Kitchenette to the Recreation Zone, but the current location is the Kitchenette. The user needs to go west to the Cookhouse. So the next action is go west.

-= Workshop =-
You are in a workshop. A standard kind of place. You begin looking for stuff.



There is an unguarded exit to the east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

There is a chocolate bar and a broccoli on the floor.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user has been moving through different rooms in the game, following a path that's been looping between the Lounge, Recreation Zone, Kitchenette, Cookhouse, Office, and now the Workshop. The goal was to pick up the chocolate bar from the Workshop's floor.

Looking at the current room description, the Workshop has a chocolate bar and broccoli on the floor. The user's previous actions have led them here, and now they need to pick up the chocolate bar. The instruction says to take a trip west after going north, then pick up the chocolate bar. But in the current room, the exits are east and south. Wait, the user is in the Workshop now. The description mentions an unguarded exit to the east and a suggestion to go south. But the chocolate is on the floor here. So the next step should be to pick up the chocolate bar.

But the user's last action was going west, which led them to the Workshop. Now, in the Workshop, they need to pick up the chocolate bar. The command should be to take the chocolate bar. However, the game's commands might require using "take" or "pick up". But the user's previous commands have been "go [direction]". The original task said to "pick up the chocolate bar from the floor of the workshop. And if you do that, you're the winner!" So the correct action here is to pick up the chocolate bar. But the system message says to only output the action, like "go north". So maybe the correct command here is "take chocolate bar" or "pick up chocolate bar". But the user's previous commands were all "go [direction]". However, in the Workshop, the chocolate is on the floor, so the player needs to pick it up. The game might require using the "take" command. But the initial instructions said to only output the action, like "go north". So perhaps the correct command here is "take chocolate bar". But I need to check the game's possible commands. Since the user has been using "go" commands, maybe the correct action here is to "take chocolate bar". However, the system message says to only output the action, so the answer should be "take chocolate bar".
