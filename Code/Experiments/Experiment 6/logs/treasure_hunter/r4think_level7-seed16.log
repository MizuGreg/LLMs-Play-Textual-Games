You are now playing a exciting game of TextWorld! First of all, you could, like, make an effort to head east. With that over with, make an effort to venture south. Okay, and then, try to venture west. And then, recover the fondue from the floor of the studio. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Dish-Pit =-
You're now in a dish-pit.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

-= Studio =-
A rusty sign tells you that you are now in the studio. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

There is a fondue on the floor.

-= Kitchenette =-
You are in a kitchenette. A normal kind of place.



There is an unguarded exit to the north.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me think through this. The user is in a text-based game where they need to recover the fondue from the studio and then win. So far, they've gone from the dish-pit to the studio, then to the kitchenette. The current location is the kitchenette, and there's an unguarded exit to the north.

The original goal was to get the fondue from the studio's floor. The user was in the studio earlier, where the fondue was present. They moved south from the studio to the kitchenette. Now, they need to find a way back to the studio to retrieve the fondue. Since the kitchenette has an exit to the north, going back north would take them back to the studio. From there, they can pick up the fondue. The next logical step is to go north to return to the studio, then pick up the fondue and win. So the correct action here is to go north.
</think>go north
