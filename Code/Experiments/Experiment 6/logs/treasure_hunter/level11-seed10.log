It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! First step, make an effort to travel south. If you can get through with that, lift the stick of butter from the floor of the cubicle. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Bedroom =-
You've moved into an usual room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be usual. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the bedroom. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.



There is an open gateway leading south. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east.

-= Cubicle =-
You find yourself in a cubicle. A normal one.



There is an open gateway leading north. There is an open gate leading west.

There is a stick of butter on the floor.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Cubicle room. The goal is to lift the stick of butter from the floor. The previous steps were going south from the Bedroom, which led to the Cubicle. Now, in the Cubicle, there's a stick of butter on the floor. The user needs to pick it up.

The current room has a gateway north and west. But the butter is on the floor, so the next action should be to pick it up. The user's previous action was going south, which was correct. Now, the immediate next step is to take the butter. The command should be "take butter" or "lift butter". Since the game mentions "lift the stick of butter", maybe "lift butter" is the correct command. Let me check the previous messages. The user was told to "lift the stick of butter from the floor of the cubicle". So the correct action is to lift it. The user is in the Cubicle now, so the next command should be "lift butter".

That's not a verb I recognise.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to play TextWorld. They started in the Bedroom, went south into the Cubicle. Now, in the Cubicle, there's a stick of butter on the floor. The original goal was to lift the butter and then proceed.

The user tried "lift butter" but got an error saying it's not a recognized verb. So, maybe the correct command is different. In text adventures, common verbs are "take", "get", "pick up", "use", etc. Since the butter is on the floor, perhaps the correct action is "take butter" or "pick up butter". The game might expect "take" instead of "lift". Let me check the possible commands again. The user was told to "lift the stick of butter from the floor of the cubicle". But the game might not recognize "lift" as a valid verb here. So the correct command is likely "take butter". Let me confirm: in many text games, "take" is the standard verb for picking up items. So the next action should be "take butter".
