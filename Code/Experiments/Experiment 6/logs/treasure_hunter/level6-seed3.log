Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First, it would be fantastic if you could venture west. If you can get through with that, travel west. With that accomplished, pick-up the broom from the floor of the basement. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Kitchenette =-
You've entered a kitchenette. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.



There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

>                                                                                                                                -= Kitchenette =-0/1
AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go west
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Bedroom =-
You are in a bedroom. A typical kind of place.



There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an unguarded exit to the west.



>                                                                                                                                -= Bedroom =-0/2
AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go west
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Basement =-
You arrive in a basement. A normal one.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a broom and a fly larva on the floor.


>                                                                                                                                -= Basement =-0/3
