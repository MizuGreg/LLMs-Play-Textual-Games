Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. Your first objective is to attempt to venture north. Then, unlock the non-euclidean passageway. After that, assure that the non-euclidean passageway inside the pantry is open. And then, take a trip north. After that, make an effort to travel north. Then, go east. With that over with, make an attempt to travel east. And then, head east. Then, head east. And then, venture south. After that, go to the south. Then, head south. With that over with, attempt to travel west. If you can finish that, recover the stick of butter from the floor of the closet. That's it!

-= Attic =-

You make out a stand. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stand? On the stand you can see a fondue.

There is an unblocked exit to the north.
