Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, you could, like, move west. Then, ensure that the hatch is open. And then, make an attempt to head west. And then, doublecheck that the portal is ajar. And then, travel north. And then, open the door. After that, make an effort to go north. With that over with, pick-up the potato from the floor of the salon. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

There is an open gateway leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the east.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in a text adventure game and has been following a set of instructions. They started in the bathroom, went west to the kitchen, opened the hatch, then went west again to the office. Now they've opened the portal in the office. The next step according to the initial instructions was to travel north after opening the portal. But the user is asking if they're on the right track and if they're close to the goal.

Looking at the current location: the Office. The description says there's an open hatch leading east and a closed portal leading north. The user just opened the portal, so maybe the next step is to go north through the portal. But the user is asking if they should proceed further. The original goal was to pick up the potato from the salon, but the current location is the office. So maybe after going north through the portal, they'll reach another area, perhaps the salon. Alternatively, maybe the portal leads to a different part of the game.

The user's next action should be to go north through the portal. But the previous step was opening the portal, so the next command would be "go north". However, the user is asking if they're close, so maybe they need to confirm if that's the correct next step. The assistant should respond with the command "go north" as per the instructions.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user has been navigating through different rooms in the text adventure. They started in the bathroom, moved to the kitchen, opened the hatch, went to the office, opened the portal, and then went north to the attic. In the attic, they opened a cabinet. Now they're asking if they're on the right track and close to the goal.

The original goal was to pick up the potato from the salon. So far, they've opened several objects: the hatch in the kitchen, the portal in the office, and the cabinet in the attic. The next logical step would be to check if the potato is in the cabinet they just opened. But the cabinet's description just mentions it's closed, and they opened it. Wait, the user just opened the cabinet, so maybe there's a potato inside? Or maybe the chest in the attic has the potato. The current room is the attic, which has a chest and a closed cabinet. The user opened the cabinet, but maybe the potato is in the chest. Alternatively, the closed door north might lead to another area. But the user's next action should be to check the chest or continue exploring. However, the user is asking if they're close, so maybe they need to check the chest or the cabinet for the potato. Since they just opened the cabinet, perhaps the potato is there. But the cabinet was already opened? Wait, the user opened the cabinet, so maybe the potato is inside. Alternatively, the chest might have it. The user should check the chest next. But the instructions said to pick up the potato from the salon. Wait, maybe the salon is a different location. The user has been moving through different rooms, but the salon hasn't been mentioned yet. Maybe the salon is in the north, through the closed door. But the user is in the attic. The original plan was to go north from the office, which led to the attic. Maybe the salon is north of the attic. So the next step would be to go north through the closed door. But the user is in the attic, and the door is closed. Alternatively, the chest or cabinet might have the potato. The user should check those. Since they just opened the cabinet, maybe the potato is there. But the description of the cabinet doesn't mention anything. The chest is described as closed. So maybe the next step is to open the chest. But the user's next action should be to check the chest or continue moving. However, the user is asking if they're close, so the assistant should suggest the next logical step. The original goal was to pick up the potato from the salon, so maybe the salon is in the north. The user is in the attic, with a closed door leading north. So the next step would be to go north through the door. But the door is closed. Alternatively, maybe the potato is in the cabinet or chest. But the user hasn't found it yet. The correct next action would be to check the chest or the cabinet for the potato. Since the user just opened the cabinet, maybe the potato is there. But the description doesn't say. Alternatively, the chest might have it. So the next action should be to open the chest. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the answer is to open the chest.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in the Attic, which has a chest and a cabinet. They opened the cabinet earlier, but didn't find the potato. Then they tried to open the chest, which was already open. Now, the potato is mentioned as being in the chest, but when they tried to pick it up, it wasn't there. Wait, maybe the potato is inside the chest, but the user didn't check it properly. The chest is open, so the user should check inside. But the game might require a specific command. The user tried "pick up potato" which didn't work, then tried "open chest" again, but it's already open. Maybe the correct action is to check the chest's contents. Since the chest is open, the user needs to take the potato from there. The previous attempt to pick it up failed, so maybe the command is "take potato" instead of "pick up". Alternatively, the game might require the user to look inside the chest first. But the user already opened the chest, so the potato should be visible. The next step is to take the potato from the chest. The correct command would be "take potato" or "get potato". Since the user tried "pick up" and it didn't work, maybe the correct verb is "take". So the next action should be "take potato".

Okay, let's see. The user has been trying to find the potato in the Attic. They opened the cabinet, then the chest, but the chest was empty. Then they went north through the door, which was closed, and after opening it, they're now in the next room. The original goal was to pick up the potato from the salon. So maybe the salon is the next room they're in now. The user needs to check if the potato is here. Since they just opened the door and moved north, the next step is to look around for the potato. The command would be to look or check the room. But the game might require a specific verb. The user might need to "look" or "examine" the room. Alternatively, maybe the potato is in the salon, and they need to pick it up from there. The correct next action would be to look around or check the current room for the potato.
