Welcome to TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, assure that the gate is ajar. After that, go to the west. And then, make an attempt to take a trip west. If you can manage that, attempt to head north. And then, take a trip east. And then, lift the telephone from the floor of the cubicle. Got that? Good!

-= Bedroom =-
You've just sauntered into a bedroom. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.



There is a closed gate leading west. There is an open door leading north.

There is a keycard on the floor.
