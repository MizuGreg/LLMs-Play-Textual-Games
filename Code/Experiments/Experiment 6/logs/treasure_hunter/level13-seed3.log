It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! First, it would be great if you could try to head east. With that done, go south. With that over with, try to go west. With that over with, pick-up the worm from the floor of the kitchenette. Alright, thanks!

-= Bedroom =-
You're now in a bedroom. You begin looking for stuff.

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a box. You shudder, but continue examining the room.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the north. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

-= Bar =-
You've entered a bar. You can barely contain your excitement.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing a text-based game and has been moving through different rooms. They started in the bedroom, went east to the bar, and now they're in the bar. The user's last action was "go east" from the bedroom, which led them to the bar. Now, they need to decide their next move.

Looking at the current environment, the bar has exits to the north, south, and west. The user's previous actions were to go east, then south (as per the initial instructions). Wait, no, the initial instructions said after going east, go south, then west, then pick up the worm. But in the game, after entering the bar, the user is in the bar. The user's next step should follow the initial plan: after going east (to the bar), go south. But the bar's description mentions an exit to the south. So the next logical step would be to go south from the bar. However, the user's previous action was "go east" from the bedroom, leading to the bar. Now, in the bar, the user should go south as per the initial instructions. But the user's last move was in the bar, so the next action should be "go south". But the user is asking if they're making the right moves and if they're close to the goal. The user's plan was to go east, then south, then west, then pick up the worm. So after the bar, going south would be the next step. However, the bar's south exit might lead to another room. But the user needs to follow the initial instructions step by step. The user's next action should be "go south" from the bar. But the user is in the bar now, so the correct next command is "go south".

-= Laundromat =-
You are in a laundromat.



There is an unguarded exit to the north. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game where they have to navigate through different rooms and possibly collect items. The initial instructions mentioned going east, then south, then west, and picking up a worm in the kitchenette. But the current rooms they've entered are the Bar and then the Laundromat.

Looking at the current room, the Laundromat, the exits are north and west. The user has been moving east, south, and now west. Wait, the original plan was to go west after going east and south. But the user is now in the Laundromat. The next step might be to check if there's a worm here or if they need to go back. However, the user's last action was going south from the Bar to the Laundromat. The next possible move would be west, as per the previous instructions. But the user is asking if they're on the right track and if they're close to the goal. 

The original goal was to pick up the worm in the kitchenette. So far, the user hasn't found the worm yet. The rooms they've visited are the Bedroom (east from there), Bar (east again?), Laundromat. Maybe the kitchenette is a different direction. But the user's path so far might not have led them to the kitchenette. Alternatively, maybe the worm is in the Laundromat, but the user hasn't checked. However, the original instruction said to pick up the worm from the floor of the kitchenette. So perhaps the user needs to find the kitchenette. 

But the current room is the Laundromat. The exits are north and west. If they go north, they might return to the Bar, then east to the Bedroom again. Maybe the kitchenette is another direction. Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go west from the Laundromat. But the user's next action was to go west, but the Laundromat's west exit is unblocked. However, the user hasn't found the worm yet. 

Wait, the user's previous actions were: go east (from Bedroom to Bar), then go south (from Bar to Laundromat). Now, the next step would be to go west from Laundromat. But the user is asking if they're on the right track. The original plan was to go east, south, west, then pick up the worm. But the user is in the Laundromat now. Maybe the west exit from Laundromat leads to the kitchenette? Or perhaps the user needs to go north from Laundromat back to Bar, then east to Bedroom, then maybe another direction. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go west from the Laundromat, but that's just a room. The user hasn't found the worm yet, so maybe they need to explore more. But the user's next action would be to go west from Laundromat. However, the user is asking if they're close to the goal. Since the worm is in the kitchenette, and the user hasn't reached that yet, maybe they need to continue exploring. 

But the user's previous steps might not have led them to the kitchenette. So the next action would be to go west from Laundromat, but that's just a guess. Alternatively, maybe the user should go north from Laundromat to return to the Bar, then east to the Bedroom again. But the original plan was to go west after going east and south. So maybe the user is on the right track but hasn't found the worm yet. 

In any case, the next action should be to go west from the Laundromat as per the initial instructions. So the answer would be "go west".
</think>go west

-= Kitchenette =-
A well framed board tells you that you are now in the kitchenette.

You smell a sickening smell, and follow it to a saucepan. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

There is a worm on the floor.

Okay, let's see. The user has been moving through different rooms: bedroom, bar, laundromat, now kitchenette. The original instructions were to go east, then south, west, and pick up the worm in the kitchenette.

So far, the user has followed the directions correctly. They went east from the bedroom, then south to the bar, west to the laundromat, and now they're in the kitchenette. The next step according to the original plan was to pick up the worm from the floor of the kitchenette. 

Looking at the current room description, there's a worm on the floor. The user's last action was going west, which led them here. The next logical step is to pick up the worm. The game's prompt mentions the worm is on the floor, so the correct command would be to pick it up. The user needs to do that to complete the task. 

The user's previous actions have been moving through the rooms as instructed. Now, the final step is to interact with the worm. The command should be "take worm" or "pick up worm". Since the game might use "take", but the exact command depends on the game's verbs. However, the user's previous actions were directional, so maybe "take worm" is the right command here. 

I need to make sure that the command is correct. The room description says "pick-up the worm from the floor of the kitchenette." So the correct action is to pick it up. The user should say "pick up worm" or "take worm". The game might expect "take", but the exact wording might vary. However, the user's previous actions were all directional, so perhaps the correct command here is "take worm". 

But the user's last action was "go west", and the next step is to pick up the worm. The correct command would be "take worm" or "pick up worm". Since the game's prompt says "pick-up the worm", maybe the correct command is "pick up worm". However, in many text adventures, the command is "take". But the user's initial instructions said "pick-up the worm from the floor of the kitchenette. Alright, thanks!" So the user is supposed to pick it up. 

Therefore, the next action should be "pick up worm".
</think>pick up worm
