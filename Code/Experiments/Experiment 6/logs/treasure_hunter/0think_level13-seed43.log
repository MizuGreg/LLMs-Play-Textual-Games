It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to attempt to take a trip north. And then, make an effort to take a trip west. After that, try to go to the north. After that, lift the Cat Calendar from the floor of the cubicle. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Cookery =-
You've just walked into a cookery. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You see a fridge. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a freezer.

You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.
