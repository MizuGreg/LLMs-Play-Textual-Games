It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! First, it would be fantastic if you could make an effort to go to the west. And then, go north. That done, recover the spoon from the floor of the super hot canteen. And once you've done that, you win!

You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.
