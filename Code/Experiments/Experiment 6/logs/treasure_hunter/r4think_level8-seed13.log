Welcome to TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First, it would be a great idea if you could make an effort to head east. Then, attempt to head north. After that, try to head west. With that over with, lift the passkey from the floor of the bar. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Laundromat =-
You find yourself in a laundromat. An ordinary kind of place.



There is an unguarded exit to the east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Canteen =-
Well, here we are in the canteen.



There is an unguarded exit to the north. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

There is a cauliflower on the floor.

-= Closet =-
You are in an usual kind of place. That is to say, you're in a closet. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.



You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me think through this. The user is in a text-based game where they need to navigate through different locations. The goal mentioned is to lift the passkey from the floor of the bar. So far, they've gone east from the laundromat to the canteen, then north to the closet. Now, in the closet, the options are to go south or west.

The user is asking if they're on the right track. Let me recall the original instructions: first go east, then north, then west. After that, lift the passkey from the bar. So far, they've done east and north. The next step according to the initial plan was west. But in the closet, the options are south or west. Going west would be the next step as per the original plan. However, the user is now in the closet, which is a new location. The original plan might have been to go west from the canteen, but maybe the path is different.

Wait, the initial task said after going east, north, west, then lift the passkey. So after the closet, maybe the next step is to go south from the closet to return to the canteen, then west to reach the bar? Or maybe the passkey is in the closet? But the original instruction says it's in the bar. Hmm.

But the user is in the closet now. The options are south or west. The original plan was to go west after north. But in the closet, west is unblocked. So maybe going west from the closet is the next step. But the user is asking if they're close to the goal. Since they've done the first three directions (east, north, west), maybe they're on the right path. The passkey is in the bar, so they need to reach the bar. So from the closet, going west might lead them to the bar. Alternatively, going south would take them back to the canteen. But the original plan was to go west after north. So perhaps the correct next step is west. But the user is in the closet, so maybe the next step is west. Let me check the current location: closet. The options are south or west. The original plan was to go west after north. So maybe the next step is west. But the user is in the closet, so going west from there would be the next step. Alternatively, maybe the passkey is in the closet, but the original instruction says it's in the bar. So the user needs to proceed to the bar. So from the closet, going west might lead to the bar. Therefore, the next action should be west. But the user is asking if they're close. Since they've done the first three directions, maybe they're close. So the next action is west.

-= Bar =-
