Hey, thanks for coming over to TextWorld! Please lift the fork from the floor of the canteen.

-= Canteen =-
You've just shown up in a canteen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a pear and a fork on the floor.
