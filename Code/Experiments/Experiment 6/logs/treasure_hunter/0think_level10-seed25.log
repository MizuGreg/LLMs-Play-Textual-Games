Welcome to TextWorld! Here is how to play! First stop, make an attempt to go to the south. Next, attempt to head east. After that, go to the south. Then, venture west. Next, pick-up the sandwich from the floor of the bedroom. And if you do that, you're the winner!

You've just sauntered into a workshop. Let's see what's in here.



There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Shower =-
I am sorry to announce that you are now in the shower.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

-= Bathroom =-
Well how about that, you are in a place we're calling a bathroom. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.
