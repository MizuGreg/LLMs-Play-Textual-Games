It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! First thing I need you to do is to try to go west. Following that, head south. Then, pick up the latchkey from the floor of the kitchenette. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Office =-
Well how about that, you are in a place we're calling an office.

You can see an opened case. The case is empty, what a horrible day!

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

-= Basement =-
You've just walked into a basement. The room is well lit.

You see a counter. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.
