Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they need to navigate through rooms and retrieve a fondue from the pantry. The current setup is that they've been moving between the Kitchen and Pantry. The goal is to recover the fondue from the pantry's floor.

So far, the user has tried going north from the Kitchen, which led them to the Pantry. In the Pantry, they've tried east, north, and south, but the exit options keep suggesting north, east, or south. The fondue is on the floor, so the next step is to pick it up. But the game's response after each move just shows the same Pantry description, so maybe the user needs to interact with the fondue directly.

Wait, the user's last action was going south, which brought them back to the Kitchen. Then they went north again to the Pantry. The Pantry has the fondue on the floor. The challenge is that the game's prompt doesn't mention any action to pick up the fondue, so maybe the user needs to use a command like 'take fondue' or 'pick up fondue' once they're in the Pantry. But the user hasn't done that yet. The previous responses only show movement, so the next logical step is to pick up the fondue. However, the user's last action was 'go south' again, leading back to the Kitchen. But the user is supposed to be in the Pantry to get the fondue. So maybe the user needs to stay in the Pantry and pick up the fondue instead of moving around. The user might have been moving back and forth, but the fondue is only in the Pantry. So the correct action is to pick up the fondue once in the Pantry. The user's next move should be to take the fondue.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to get the fondue from the pantry. They went north to the pantry, but when they tried to take the fondue, the game said they couldn't see it. Wait, maybe they're not in the pantry anymore. The last few moves were going back and forth between kitchen and pantry. The user might have moved away from the pantry after picking it up. But the game's response says "You can't see any such thing," which suggests the fondue isn't in the current location. Maybe the user needs to stay in the pantry and try again. Alternatively, maybe the fondue is on the floor, so they need to pick it up once they're in the pantry. But the user's last action was in the kitchen. So the correct step is to go back to the pantry and take the fondue. The next action should be going north again to the pantry and then taking the fondue.
