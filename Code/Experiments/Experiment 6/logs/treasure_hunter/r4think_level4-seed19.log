Welcome to another life changing game of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First, it would be a great idea if you could make an attempt to go west. Then, pick-up the passkey from the floor of the cubicle. Got that? Good!

-= Laundry Place =-
You arrive in a laundry place. A normal one. You begin to take stock of what's here.



You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Cubicle =-
I am sorry to announce that you are now in the cubicle.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north.

There is a passkey and a key on the floor.

That's not a verb I recognise.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game, and they've been trying to pick up the passkey. But the system keeps saying "That's not a verb I recognise." Hmm, maybe the correct command isn't "pick-up" but something else like "take" or "get"?

Looking back at the previous interactions, the user first went west, then tried to pick up the passkey. The game's response was confusing, so maybe the game expects a different verb. In many text adventures, "take" is the standard command for picking up items. Let me check the game's context again. The cubicle has a passkey and a key on the floor. The user needs to pick up the passkey, but the system isn't recognizing "pick-up". 

Wait, maybe the game uses "take" instead of "pick-up". So the correct command should be "take passkey". Alternatively, maybe it's "get passkey". But the user tried "pick-up" and it didn't work. The system might be case-sensitive, so maybe "Pick-up" or "Pick Up"? Or perhaps the game uses a different syntax. 

Alternatively, maybe the game expects the user to use the verb "get" instead of "pick-up". Let me think about common text adventure commands. "Take" is more common than "pick-up". So the correct command is likely "take passkey". 

But the user's previous attempt was "pick-up passkey", which was rejected. So the next step is to try "take passkey" or "get passkey". Since the user is supposed to only output the action, the correct command here would be "take passkey". 

Also, the user asked if they're making the right actions. So far, they went west, which led them to the cubicle. Then they tried to pick up the passkey. Even though the system rejected it, the correct action is likely "take passkey". So the next command should be "take passkey".
