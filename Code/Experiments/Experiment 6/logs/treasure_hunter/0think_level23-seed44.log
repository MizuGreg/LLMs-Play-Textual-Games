Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! First of all, you could, like, move north. With that accomplished, venture east. And then, head north. And then, make an attempt to venture west. After that, make an attempt to take a trip north. Once you accomplish that, make an attempt to take a trip west. And then, recover the scarf from the rack inside the pantry. Got that? Good!

-= Closet =-
You are in a closet. A typical kind of place. The room is well lit.

Hey, want to see a suitcase? Look over there, a suitcase. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. A closed display, which looks normal, is close by.

You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.
