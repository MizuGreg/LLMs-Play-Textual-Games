Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. Your first objective is to head south. With that over with, ensure that the portal in the cellar is open. After opening the portal, make an attempt to move south. Then, make an attempt to go to the west. Once you succeed at that, head north. And then, move west. With that done, retrieve the peanut from the floor of the studio. Got that? Good!

-= Basement =-
You arrive in a basement. An ordinary one. You begin to take stock of what's here.



There is an open gate leading north. There is an open hatch leading south.

You open portal.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me figure out what to do next. The user is in the cellar. The previous steps were: go south from the basement, open the portal in the cellar. Now, the portal is open. The original goal was to head south, open the portal, then go south again, west, north, west, and retrieve the peanut in the studio.

So after opening the portal, the next step according to the instructions was to attempt to move south. But the portal is leading south, so maybe moving south through the portal. But the user is in the cellar, and the portal is closed, but they just opened it. Wait, the current location is the cellar, and the portal is open. So the next step would be to go south through the portal. But the user's next action after opening the portal was to move south. Let me check the environment again.

In the cellar, there's a closed portal leading south and an open hatch leading north. But after opening the portal, the portal is now open. So the user can go south through the portal. So the next action should be to go south. Then, after moving south, they need to go west, then north, then west again to get the peanut in the studio. So the next step is to go south through the portal. The user's next command should be "go south".
