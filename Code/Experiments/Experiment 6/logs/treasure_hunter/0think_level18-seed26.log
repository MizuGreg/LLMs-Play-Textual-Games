Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First stop, make an attempt to move north. Following that, make an attempt to head east. And then, travel east. And then, try to venture east. Then, move south. Once you do that, make an attempt to head west. Once you succeed at that, attempt to go to the west. That done, retrieve the hat from the floor of the attic. Got that? Good!
