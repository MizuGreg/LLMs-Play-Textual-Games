Welcome to TextWorld! First of all, venture south. That done, ensure that the hatch in the steam room is open. And then, go south. Next, make an effort to head west. And then, make sure that the gateway is open. Having pulled open the gateway, attempt to travel west. And then, pick-up the latchkey from the floor of the bedroom. And if you do that, you're the winner!
