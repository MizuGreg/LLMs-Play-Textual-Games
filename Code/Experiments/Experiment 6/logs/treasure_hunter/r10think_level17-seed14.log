I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. Your first objective is to attempt to take a trip north. Then, open the portal within the laundromat. Having opened the portal, make an effort to venture north. Then, make an effort to move west. After that, travel north. After that, travel east. With that over with, retrieve the butterfly from the box within the workshop. That's it!
