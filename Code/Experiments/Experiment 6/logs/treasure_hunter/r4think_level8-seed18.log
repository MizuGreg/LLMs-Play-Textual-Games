Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, make an attempt to take a trip west. And then, travel south. Once you manage that, try to go east. Following that, recover the latchkey from the floor of the studio. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Cubicle =-
You arrive in a cubicle. An ordinary one.



There is an unguarded exit to the west.

There is a key on the floor.

You've just walked into a study.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

You find yourself in a workshop.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the north.

-= Studio =-
Well I'll be, you are in a place we're calling a studio. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

There is a latchkey on the floor.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me figure out what to do next. The user has been moving through different rooms: cubicle, study, workshop, and now the studio. The goal was to go west, then south, east, and recover the latchkey from the studio floor.

So far, they've gone west from the cubicle, south to the study, east to the workshop, and now they're in the studio. The studio has a latchkey on the floor, which is the item they need to collect. The prompt says to recover the latchkey from the floor of the studio. So the next logical step is to pick up the latchkey.

The user's last action was going east into the studio. Now, they need to pick up the latchkey. The command should be "take latchkey" or "get latchkey". But in TextWorld, the correct command might be "take" followed by the item name. Let me check the previous interactions. In the studio description, it says "There is a latchkey on the floor." So the correct action is to take the latchkey. The user hasn't done that yet, so the next step is to take it. Then, after that, they can stop as per the original goal. So the next command should be "take latchkey".
