It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is how to play! Your first objective is to try to take a trip west. After that, open the portal in the bedchamber. And then, make an attempt to venture west. And then, go south. With that accomplished, pick-up the latchkey from the floor of the closet. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Canteen =-
Well I'll be, you are in the place we're calling the canteen.
