Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is how to play! First off, make an effort to take a trip south. And then, go to the west. After that, retrieve the fly larva from the floor of the cookhouse. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Study =-
Of every study you could have walked into, you had to come round an usual one. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You see a locked coffer. You make out a trunk. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You scan the room for a stand, and you find a stand. The stand is typical. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is an open gateway leading east. There is an open gate leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

You make a grand eccentric entrance into a vault. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You see a suitcase. You make out a counter. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the counter.

You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is in a text-based game called TextWorld. The goal mentioned earlier was to "pick stuff up and put it in places," and the specific steps were to go south, then west, retrieve the fly larva from the cookhouse, and then stop.

Looking at the current scenario, the user is in the Vault room. The description says there's a suitcase and a counter, but nothing on the counter. The exits are north and west. The previous actions involved moving back and forth between the Study and Vault rooms, going south from the Study to Vault, then north back to Study, and repeating. 

The user is now at the Vault again, and the prompt says to think about whether the actions so far are correct and if they're close to the goal. The user is asking if they're on the right track and if they're near the original goal.

First, I need to check if the current location (Vault) is part of the path to the cookhouse. The initial instructions said to go south, then west. The Study room has a gateway east and west, and the Vault has a north and west exit. Maybe the cookhouse is in a different area, but the user hasn't found the fly larva yet.

The user hasn't picked up anything yet. The locked coffer in the Study and the suitcase in the Vault might be places to look for items. The fly larva is supposed to be on the floor of the cookhouse. So maybe the user needs to find the cookhouse first.

But the current location is the Vault. The exits are north (back to Study) and west. The user hasn't tried going west yet in the Vault. The Study room has a west gate, but the Vault's west exit is unguarded. Maybe the cookhouse is west of the Vault? Or perhaps the user needs to go west from the Vault to reach the cookhouse.

Alternatively, maybe the user is stuck in a loop between Study and Vault, not making progress. The user needs to find the fly larva, which is in the cookhouse. So the path would be: Study -> South to Vault -> West to cookhouse? But the user hasn't tried that yet.

In the current state, the user is in the Vault. The next logical step would be to go west from the Vault, as that's the unguarded exit mentioned. If the cookhouse is west of the Vault, then going west would be the right move. The user hasn't tried that yet, so the next action should be "go west" to proceed towards the cookhouse and retrieve the fly larva.
</think>go west

-= Cookhouse =-
You're now in the cookhouse.

You can make out a locked case, which looks usual, in the room.

There is an open portal leading north. There is an open hatch leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a fly larva on the floor.
