Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user has been following a set of instructions to navigate through different rooms in the TextWorld game. They started by going north, opening a hatch, going west, and so on. Each step seems to align with the tasks given.

Now, the current location is the Office. The user has just opened the walnut gate and gone west, leading them to the Office. The next step in the original task was to go south from the Bathroom after opening the walnut gate. But in the current state, they're in the Office, and the next step mentioned in the task was to go south. However, the Office's description mentions an open passageway south. 

Wait, the user's last action was "go west" from the Bathroom, which led them to the Office. The task said after opening the walnut gate (which they did), they should travel west, which they did, then go south. But in the Office, the south passage is unguarded. So the next step should be to go south from the Office. 

But the user is asking if they're making the right actions and if they're close to the goal. The original task was to pick up the latchkey from the closet's floor. So far, they've navigated through several rooms. The next step would be to go south from the Office to reach the next room, which might be the closet where the latchkey is. 

So the correct next action is "go south" from the Office. The user needs to proceed to the next room to find the latchkey. The current position is the Office, and the south passage is open, so that's the next step.

-= Closet =-
You find yourself in a closet. An ordinary one. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You see a stand. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north.

There is a latchkey on the floor.
