I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! First of all, take a trip north. Then, travel east. With that done, take the butterfly from the box. Alright, thanks!

-= Office =-
You find yourself in an usual kind of place. That is to say, you're in an office.

You can see a desk. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

There is an open passageway leading east. There is an open gateway leading north.

>                                                                                                                                -= Office =-0/1

-= Chamber =-
You find yourself in a chamber. An ordinary one.



There is an open gateway leading south. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Workshop =-
You've just shown up in a workshop.

You can see a box. The box contains a butterfly. You make out a locker. You can see a portmanteau.

You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.



>                                                                                                                                -= Workshop =-0/3
AGENT -------------------------------------------------
