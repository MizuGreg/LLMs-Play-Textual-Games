You are now playing a fast paced episode of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First thing I need you to do is to assure that the passageway is open. And then, try to head north. And then, head east. That done, recover the apple from the floor of the canteen. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Cookery =-
Ah, the cookery. This is some kind of cookery, really great usual vibes in this place, a wonderful usual atmosphere. And now, well, you're in it.

You make out a case.

There is a closed door leading east. There is a closed passageway leading north. There is an open portal leading south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

-= Kitchen =-
You've entered a kitchen.

You see a rack. The rack is ordinary. But the thing is empty. You move on, clearly done caring about your TextWorld experience.

There is an open passageway leading south. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

-= Canteen =-
You find yourself in a canteen. An ordinary one.

You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a saucepan. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You move on, clearly done caring about your TextWorld experience.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

There is an apple and a passkey on the floor.
