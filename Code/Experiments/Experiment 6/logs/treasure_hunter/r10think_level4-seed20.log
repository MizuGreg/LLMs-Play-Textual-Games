It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to head east. And then, pick-up the loaf of bread from the floor of the garage. Alright, thanks!

-= Sauna =-
Ah, the sauna. This is some kind of sauna, really great normal vibes in this place, a wonderful normal atmosphere. And now, well, you're in it.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

There is a keycard on the floor.

Well, here we are in the garage. You start to take note of what's in the room.



There is an unblocked exit to the west.

There is a loaf of bread on the floor.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, the user is stuck in the game because they're trying to pick up the loaf of bread, but the system keeps saying "That's not a verb I recognise." Let me check the previous interactions.

First, the user was told to go east, which they did, leading them to the Garage. Then they tried to pick up the bread, but the system doesn't recognize "pick-up" as a valid command. Maybe the correct verb is "take" instead of "pick-up". In many text adventures, the command is "take loaf of bread" rather than "pick-up".

The user has tried "pick-up loaf of bread" multiple times, but it's not working. The system might be expecting "take" instead. So the next action should be to use "take" instead of "pick-up". Let me confirm that. The correct command in such games is usually "take" followed by the item name. So the user needs to say "take loaf of bread".

The user is also asking if they're on the right track. They've reached the Garage, which is the correct location for the bread. So the next step is to use the correct command to pick up the bread. Once that's done, they might proceed to the next part of the game, like exiting the garage or moving to another area. But since the system is not recognizing "pick-up", switching to "take" should resolve the issue.
