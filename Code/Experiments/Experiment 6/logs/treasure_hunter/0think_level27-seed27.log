Welcome to another life changing game of TextWorld! First thing I need you to do is to attempt to venture east. And then, retrieve the TextWorld style latchkey from the floor of the cubicle. Then, unlock the TextWorld style passageway within the cubicle. Then, ensure that the TextWorld style passageway is open. Then, attempt to travel east. After that, make an attempt to head south. Then, try to venture west. And then, make an effort to move south. With that over with, head west. After that, make an attempt to travel south. Following that, venture south. With that done, go west. And then, make an effort to go to the north. If you can finish that, pick up the mug from the floor of the super hot canteen. Got that? Good!
