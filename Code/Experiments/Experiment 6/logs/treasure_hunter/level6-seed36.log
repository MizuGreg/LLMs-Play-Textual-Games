Welcome to another fast paced round of TextWorld! First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to make an effort to venture east. With that accomplished, attempt to go north. With that accomplished, recover the licorice strip from the floor of the spare room. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Sauna =-
Well, here we are in a sauna.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.
