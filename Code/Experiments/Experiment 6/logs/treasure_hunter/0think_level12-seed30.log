Welcome to another exciting game of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, try to go west. Then, attempt to go to the south. With that accomplished, pick-up the latchkey from the floor of the closet. And if you do that, you're the winner!

You can see a closed basket. What's that over there? It looks like it's a mantle. The mantle is ordinary. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.

There is an open hatch leading east. There is an open portal leading west.
