Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, make an attempt to take a trip west. And then, travel south. Once you manage that, try to go east. Following that, recover the latchkey from the floor of the studio. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Cubicle =-
You arrive in a cubicle. An ordinary one.



There is an unguarded exit to the west.

There is a key on the floor.
