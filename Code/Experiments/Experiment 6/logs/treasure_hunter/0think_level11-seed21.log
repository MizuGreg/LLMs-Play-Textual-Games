Welcome to TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, you could, like, move east. Okay, and then, pick up the keycard from the floor of the kitchen. That's it!

-= Canteen =-
You find yourself in a canteen. A typical one.

You see a refrigerator. What a letdown! The refrigerator is empty!

There is an open portal leading north. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go east

-= Kitchen =-
Well, here we are in the kitchen. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."



You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

There is a keycard on the floor.
