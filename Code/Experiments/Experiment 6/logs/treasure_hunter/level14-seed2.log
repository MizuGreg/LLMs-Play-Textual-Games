Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First, it would be fantastic if you could try to move south. Next, venture east. With that over with, go to the south. And then, go to the west. If you can manage that, retrieve the latchkey from the floor of the studio. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Kitchen =-
You've entered a kitchen. Let's see what's in here.

You see a plate. The plate is ordinary. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is an open portal leading north. There is an unguarded exit to the east. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

-= Workshop =-
You arrive in a workshop. An ordinary one.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this TextWorld game, and they've already moved south from the kitchen to the workshop. The current room is the workshop, which has an exit to the east and mentions trying to go north or south. The original task was to move south, then east, then south again, then west, get the latchkey from the studio, and win.

So far, the user has done the first part: moved south. Now, the next steps according to the task are to venture east. The workshop has an unguarded exit to the east, so that's probably the next move. The user's next action should be to go east. Let me check the current room description again. The workshop says there's an exit to the east, unguarded, and suggests trying north or south. But the task says after moving south (from kitchen to workshop), venture east. So the next step is east. Then, after that, the task says go to the south again, then west. But first, the user needs to go east from the workshop. So the correct next command is "go east".

-= Spare Room =-
You are in a spare room. A standard one. You begin looking for stuff.

You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a shelf. But there isn't a thing on it.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this TextWorld game, and their goal is to pick up the latchkey from the studio and put it in the right place. So far, they've moved south from the kitchen to the workshop, then east to the spare room. Now, they're in the spare room, which has exits in all four directions.

The original instructions said to first move south, then east, then south again, then west. But the user has already done south (from kitchen to workshop), then east (to spare room). The next step in the original plan was to go south again. But in the spare room, the exits are north, east, south, west. So moving south from the spare room would take them back to the workshop. But the user's current position is the spare room. Wait, maybe the original plan was to go south, east, south, west, but maybe the path is a loop? Or maybe the studio is in a different location.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to navigate to the studio. The original task mentioned retrieving the latchkey from the studio's floor. So perhaps the studio is a different room. The user has been moving through kitchen, workshop, spare room. Maybe the studio is in one of the other directions. Let me check the previous rooms.

In the kitchen, there's an exit to the east (which led to the workshop), and the user tried going south from the kitchen to the workshop. Then from the workshop, they went east to the spare room. Now, in the spare room, the exits are north (to workshop), east (to somewhere else?), south (back to workshop?), and west (maybe to another room?).

Wait, the user's original plan was to move south, east, south, west. But after moving south from the kitchen to workshop, then east to spare room, the next step in the original plan was to go south again. But from the spare room, going south would take them back to the workshop. But the workshop's exit is east. Maybe the studio is in a different direction. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west from the spare room. Let me check the current room's description again.

In the spare room, there's an exit to the west. So if the user goes west from the spare room, they might reach a different room. The original task mentioned the studio, so perhaps the studio is west of the spare room. If that's the case, then going west from the spare room would take them to the studio. Then they can pick up the latchkey. But the user hasn't tried that yet. So the next step would be to go west. But the user's current position is the spare room, and the original plan was to go south, east, south, west. But the user has already done south (kitchen to workshop), east (workshop to spare room). The next step in the original plan was to go south again, but that would take them back to the workshop. However, maybe the studio is in the west direction from the spare room. So the user should go west from the spare room to reach the studio, then pick up the latchkey. Therefore, the next action should be to go west.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game called TextWorld. Their goal is to navigate through different rooms, move in specific directions, and eventually retrieve the latchkey from the studio. 

First, they started in the Kitchen, moved south to the Workshop, then east to the Spare Room, and west back to the Workshop. Now they're back in the Workshop again. The task mentioned earlier was to move south, then east, then south again, then west, retrieve the latchkey from the studio floor.

Wait, the current room is the Workshop. The user has been moving between rooms, but they haven't reached the studio yet. The original instructions said after moving west, they need to go to the south (from the Spare Room?), but maybe the path isn't straightforward. Let me check the previous steps again.

The user's path so far: Kitchen (south) → Workshop (east) → Spare Room (west) → back to Workshop. Now, in the Workshop, the exits are east, north, and south. The original task said after moving west, go to the south. Maybe from the Workshop, going south would lead to the next room. But the user hasn't found the studio yet. The studio is where the latchkey is. So perhaps the next step is to go south from the Workshop to reach the studio. Let me check the previous room descriptions.

In the Spare Room, the exits were east, north, south, west. When they went west, they returned to the Workshop. The original plan was to move south from the Spare Room, but maybe that's not the case. The user needs to find the studio. Maybe the studio is connected via the Workshop's south exit. So the next action should be to go south from the Workshop. That would take them to the next room, possibly the studio. Then, once there, they can look for the latchkey on the floor. So the next command should be "go south".

-= Studio =-
You've just shown up in a studio. You can barely contain your excitement.

Oh, great. Here's a stand. The stand appears to be empty.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

There is a latchkey on the floor.

Okay, let's see. The user has been moving through different rooms in the game. The goal is to retrieve the latchkey from the studio's floor.

First, they started in the kitchen, moved south to the workshop, then east to the spare room, west back to the workshop, south again to the studio. Now they're in the studio, and the latchkey is on the floor. The next step should be to pick up the latchkey. The previous actions were all about moving between rooms, but now that they're in the studio, the immediate action is to pick up the latchkey. The user needs to pick it up and then maybe go back through the exits to reach the original goal. Since the instruction says to retrieve the latchkey and then be the winner, the next command should be to pick up the latchkey.
