Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First, it would be fantastic if you could try to move south. Next, venture east. With that over with, go to the south. And then, go to the west. If you can manage that, retrieve the latchkey from the floor of the studio. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Kitchen =-
You've entered a kitchen. Let's see what's in here.

You see a plate. The plate is ordinary. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is an open portal leading north. There is an unguarded exit to the east. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is in a text-based game where they have to navigate between rooms and find a latchkey in a studio. The current setup seems to be looping between the Kitchen and Workshop. The user has been moving south and north repeatedly, which is causing the same rooms to appear again.

Looking at the task description, the user needs to move south, then east, then south again, then west. After that, they need to retrieve the latchkey from the studio's floor. But so far, the user has only been moving between the Kitchen and Workshop, which might not be the correct path.

Wait, the initial instructions said to first move south, then east, then south, then west. But in the current state, the user is in the Kitchen again after moving south. Maybe the Workshop isn't part of the correct path. Let me check the room descriptions again.

In the Kitchen, there's an exit to the east and a portal north. The Workshop has an exit east and suggests going north or south. But the user's task is to go east after moving south. Maybe the correct path is to go east from the Kitchen, but the user has been going south instead. Wait, the first step was to move south, which took them to the Workshop. Then moving north brings them back to the Kitchen. But the task says after moving south, venture east. So perhaps after moving south to the Workshop, they should go east, but the Workshop's east exit is unguarded. However, the user's next steps have been moving north and south again, which might not be leading them towards the studio.

Alternatively, maybe the studio is in a different part of the map. The user needs to retrieve the latchkey from the studio's floor. So perhaps the correct path is to go east from the Kitchen, but the initial move was south. Maybe the user is stuck in a loop between Kitchen and Workshop. Let me check the original task again.

Original task: First, move south. Then venture east. Then go south again. Then west. Then get the latchkey. So after moving south (to Workshop), then east (to another room?), then south, then west. But the current rooms are only Kitchen and Workshop. Maybe the user hasn't found the studio yet. Perhaps the studio is accessible from the Workshop's east exit. But the Workshop's east exit is unguarded. If the user goes east from Workshop, they might reach the studio. Let me check the previous steps.

In the Workshop, the user is told there's an exit to the east. So if they go east from Workshop, they might enter the studio. Then, from the studio, they can go south or west as per the task. But the user hasn't tried that yet. So the next step should be to go east from the Workshop. But in the current state, the user is in the Workshop again, and the last action was go north, leading back to Kitchen. So the user needs to go east from Workshop instead of north or south.

Therefore, the correct next action is to go east from the Workshop to reach the studio, then proceed as per the task. But the user has been moving north and south, which is causing the loop. So the user needs to go east from the Workshop to proceed towards the studio.

Okay, let's try to figure out what's going on here. The user is in a text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and find a latchkey in a studio. The current room is the Laundry Place, and the user has been moving between the Bar, Spare Room, and Laundry Place repeatedly.

The original task was to move south, then east, then south again, then west, and then retrieve the latchkey from the studio's floor. So far, the user has been moving between rooms without clearly progressing towards the studio. The current room is the Laundry Place, which has an exit to the north and west. The user has been going back and forth between the Bar and Spare Room, which might not be the correct path.

The key here is to find the studio. The user needs to go east from the Kitchen, then south, then west. But in the current path, they've ended up in the Laundry Place. Maybe the studio is accessible from the Laundry Place via the north exit. Let me check the previous steps again.

In the Laundry Place, the user can go north. The north exit leads to the Bar, which then leads back to the Spare Room. But the user needs to get to the studio. Perhaps the studio is in a different direction. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west from the Laundry Place. The Laundry Place has an exit to the west, which might lead to another room. But the user hasn't tried that yet.

Wait, in the Laundry Place, the user is told there's an exit to the west. If they go west from the Laundry Place, they might reach the studio. Let me check the previous rooms.

You're now in a laundry place.

You make out an opened safe close by. What a letdown! The safe is empty! You make out a counter. The counter is ordinary. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out what's going on here. The user is in a text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and find a latchkey in a studio. The current room is the Laundry Place, and the user has been moving between the Bar, Spare Room, and Laundry Place repeatedly.

The original task was to move south, then east, then south again, then west, and then retrieve the latchkey from the studio's floor. So far, the user has been moving between rooms without clearly progressing towards the studio. The current room is the Laundry Place, which has an exit to the north and west. The user has been going back and forth between the Bar and Spare Room, which might not be the correct path.

The key here is to find the studio. The user needs to go east from the Kitchen, then south, then west. But in the current path, they've ended up in the Laundry Place. Maybe the studio is accessible from the Laundry Place via the north exit. Let me check the previous steps again.

In the Laundry Place, the user is told there's an exit to the west. If they go west from the Laundry Place, they might reach the studio. But the user hasn't tried that yet. The user's next action should be to go west from the Laundry Place to reach the studio and then retrieve the latchkey.

You find yourself in a steam room. A typical one.

You can make out a box, so there's that. You make out a rack. The rack is typical. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can see a table. The table is normal. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.
