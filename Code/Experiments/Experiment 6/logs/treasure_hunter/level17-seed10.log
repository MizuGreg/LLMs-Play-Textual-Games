It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. Your first objective is to try to go north. After that, make an effort to venture east. Next, open the portal. After you have opened the portal, take a trip north. And then, assure that the gate is open. After pulling open the gate, go to the east. Okay, and then, lift the stick of butter from the floor of the cubicle. And once you've done that, you win!

Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. This always happens!

There is a closed portal leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

There is a passkey on the floor.
