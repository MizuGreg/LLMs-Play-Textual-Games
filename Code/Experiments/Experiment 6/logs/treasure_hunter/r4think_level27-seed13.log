I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First step, go north. Following that, make sure that the fresh laundry scented door in the kitchenette is unlocked. After you have unlocked the fresh laundry scented door, ensure that the fresh laundry scented door is open. And then, attempt to take a trip north. After that, make an effort to go to the north. After that, head west. Next, make an effort to venture west. Following that, make an attempt to go to the west. With that over with, go to the west. And then, travel south. Then, go east. Once you finish that, move south. If you can get through with that, make an effort to venture south. If you can do that, recover the key from the floor of the bar. Alright, thanks!

-= Laundromat =-
You find yourself in a laundromat. An usual kind of place.

You make out a locked safe. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a board. The board is typical. But there isn't a thing on it. You think about smashing the board to bits, throwing the bits in a fire, etc, until you get bored.

There is an open gate leading north. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

Okay, let me try to figure out what the next step should be. The user has been following a series of instructions to navigate through the laundromat and kitchenette. So far, they've gone north from the laundromat to the kitchenette, unlocked the fresh laundry scented door. The current location is the kitchenette, and the door leading north is now unlocked.

The next step in the original task was to ensure that the fresh laundry scented door is open after unlocking it. So after unlocking, the next action should be to open the door. The user has already unlocked it, but the door might still be closed. So the next command should be to open the door.

Looking at the previous interactions, the user was told to "ensure that the fresh laundry scented door is open" after unlocking. So the correct action here is to open the door. The user has the key, so they can open it. The next command should be "open fresh laundry scented door".

There is an open fresh laundry scented door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user has been trying to follow a series of steps in the TextWorld game. They started in the laundromat, went north to the kitchenette, unlocked the fresh laundry door, opened it, then went north again into the bedroom, then to the cookery. Now, they're in the cookery and tried to go north again, but it's not possible.

The original task was to navigate through various rooms, unlock the door, open it, then go north, west, south, east, etc. So far, they've done most of the steps except maybe the part where they needed to recover the key from the bar's floor. But in the current scenario, they're stuck in the cookery and can't go north. The available exits are south and west. The next step might be to go west, as the user had previously tried going west in the bedroom. But the user's last action was trying to go north again, which is blocked. So the correct next action would be to go west. Let me check the previous steps again.

In the bedroom, the user was told to try going north or west. Then they went north to cookery. Now, in cookery, the exits are south and west. So the next logical step is to go west. The user needs to continue moving west to reach the next room. The original goal mentioned moving west multiple times, so going west from cookery makes sense. Therefore, the next command should be "go west".

-= Washroom =-
You arrive in a washroom. An usual one.

You scan the room for a dresser, and you find a dresser. You look at the price tag that the dresser's owner still hasn't taken off. Three hundred big ones?! Where'd they buy this dresser, some kind of expensive store? Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a bench. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You see a rack. The rack is standard. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unblocked exit to the south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Okay, let's see. The user has been navigating through various rooms in the TextWorld game. They started in the laundromat, moved to the kitchenette, unlocked and opened the fresh laundry door, then went north to the bedroom, then to the cookery, then west to the washroom. Now they're in the salon.

The original task involved moving in specific directions multiple times: go north, unlock the door, open it, then go north again, west, south, east, etc. The user has been following those steps, but maybe they need to check if they're on the right path. In the salon, the available exits are east, north, and west. The user's previous actions included going west from the washroom, so maybe the next step is to go west again from the salon. But the user's last action was going south to reach the salon. The salon's description mentions an unguarded exit to the west. So the next logical move would be to go west. Alternatively, the user might need to go north or east. But considering the original instructions, they needed to go west after some steps. Let me check the original task again.

The original instructions said: after unlocking and opening the door, attempt to take a trip north, then make an effort to go to the north again, then head west, venture west, attempt to go to the west, then go west again, then travel south, go east, move south again, etc. So after the salon, the user might need to go west again. The salon has an exit to the west, so "go west" is the next command.

Okay, let's see. The user has been moving around the TextWorld game, going through various rooms like laundromat, kitchenette, bedroom, cookery, washroom, salon, shower, and restroom. The original goal was to navigate through specific directions multiple times, including going north, west, south, east, and eventually recover a key from the bar's floor.

So far, the user has followed the steps: went north from laundromat to kitchenette, unlocked and opened the fresh laundry door, then went north to bedroom, then to cookery, west to washroom, south to salon, east to shower, north to salon again, west to washroom, south to restroom. Now, in the restroom, the exits are east, south, and west. The user's last action was going west from the restroom, but the current room is the restroom again. Wait, no, the last step was going west from the restroom, which led back to the shower? Or maybe the user is looping between rooms.

The original task mentioned after going west, traveling south, going east, moving south again, etc. The user might be getting stuck in a loop. But the key part was to recover the key from the bar's floor. However, in the current path, the user hasn't encountered a bar yet. Maybe the key is in a different part of the map. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check if they've missed a room where the key is located.

But according to the current room, the restroom has an unguarded exit to the east. The user's next move should be to go east again. Alternatively, since the original instructions mentioned moving south after going west, perhaps the next step is to go south from the restroom. But the user is in the restroom, and the exits are east, south, and west. The user's last action was going west, which might have led back to the shower. But the current room is the restroom. So the next action should be to go east, as that's unguarded. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go south to continue the path. However, the original goal might require moving in specific directions, so the user should follow the sequence: after going west, travel south, then go east, then move south again. So from the restroom, going south would be the next step. But the user is in the restroom, and the exit to the south is unguarded. So the correct next action is to go south.
