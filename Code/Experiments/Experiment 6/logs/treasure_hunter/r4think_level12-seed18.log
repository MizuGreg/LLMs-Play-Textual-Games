Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an profound round of TextWorld? You do! First step, go west. Then, take a trip south. And then, lift the latchkey from the floor of the closet. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Bathroom =-
You've come into a typical room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be typical. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the bathroom.

You make out a cabinet. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a drawer. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a trunk.

There is an open passageway leading south. There is an open walnut gate leading west.

-= Office =-
You've just sauntered into an office.



There is an open walnut gate leading east. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

-= Closet =-
You find yourself in a closet. An ordinary one. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You see a stand. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north.

There is a latchkey on the floor.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to complete the TextWorld game. They followed the instructions: go west, then south, then lift the latchkey. But when they tried to lift the latchkey, the game said it's not a recognized verb.

Wait, maybe the correct action isn't "lift" but something else. Let me check the game's context. In the Closet room, there's a latchkey on the floor. The user needs to pick it up. But the game might expect a different verb. Maybe "take" instead of "lift"? Or perhaps "pick up"?

But the user has already tried "lift" multiple times, and it's not working. Maybe the game uses "take" as the correct verb. Let me think. In many text adventures, "take" is the standard command for picking up items. So maybe the correct action is "take the latchkey" or just "take latchkey".

But the user's previous attempt was "lift the latchkey", which didn't work. So the next step should be to use "take" instead. Let me check the game's possible commands. The user is in the Closet, and the latchkey is on the floor. The correct verb might be "take" or "get".

So the next action should be "take the latchkey" or "take latchkey". Since the game might require the article "the", maybe "take the latchkey". But the user might need to specify the object correctly. Alternatively, maybe the game expects "get" instead of "take".

Alternatively, maybe the game is case-sensitive. But the user tried "lift" and it didn't work. So perhaps the correct verb is "take". Let me try that. The user's next command should be "take the latchkey".
