Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. Your first objective is to go north. Then, make an effort to venture east. And then, go to the north. And then, retrieve the key from the floor of the studio. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Scullery =-
You've entered a scullery.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unblocked exit to the north. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

>                                                                                                                                -= Scullery =-0/1
AGENT -------------------------------------------------

-= Pantry =-
You find yourself in a pantry.

You make out an opened safe in the room. The safe is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You see a case. Huh, weird. The case is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever!

There is an unguarded exit to the east. There is an unblocked exit to the south. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

-= Closet =-
Ah, the closet. This is some kind of closet, really great ordinary vibes in this place, a wonderful ordinary atmosphere. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You can see a stand. The stand is normal. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an unguarded exit to the north. There is an unblocked exit to the south. There is an unblocked exit to the west.
