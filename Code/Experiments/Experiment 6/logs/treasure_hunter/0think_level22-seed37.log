I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is how to play! First thing I need you to do is to travel north. Then, attempt to take a trip west. Then, make an attempt to venture south. Then, make an attempt to move west. With that accomplished, pick up the bowl from the counter within the cookhouse. Alright, thanks!
