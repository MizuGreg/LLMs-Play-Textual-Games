Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an profound round of TextWorld? You do! First thing I need you to do is to make an attempt to move west. That done, take a trip south. Then, pick-up the worm from the floor of the canteen. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Kitchenette =-
You've entered a kitchenette.



You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

-= Spare Room =-
Of every spare room you could have sauntered into, you had to show up in an ordinary one. The room is well lit.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Canteen =-
Well, here we are in a canteen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a worm on the floor.
