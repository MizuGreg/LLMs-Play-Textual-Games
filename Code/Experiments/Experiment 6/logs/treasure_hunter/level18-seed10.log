It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! First stop, try to go to the west. Following that, make an effort to venture north. Next, venture east. Then, doublecheck that the portal is open. After that, make an effort to go to the north. Then, make absolutely sure that the gate inside the kitchenette is opened. After that, take a trip east. And then, pick-up the stick of butter from the floor of the cubicle. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. This always happens!

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game and has been following the instructions to explore different rooms. So far, they've gone west, north, east, checked the portal, opened it, and then went north again into the Kitchenette. Now, they're in the Kitchenette, which has a closed gate leading east and an open portal south. The prompt says to check if the gate inside the kitchenette is opened, but according to the current description, the gate is closed. Wait, the user's previous action was to go north into the Kitchenette, and the current state shows a closed gate east and an open portal south. The user's next step is to make sure the gate is opened.

But the user's instruction said after opening the portal, they should "make absolutely sure that the gate inside the kitchenette is opened." So the next action should be to open the gate. However, the current description says the gate is closed. So the correct action here is to open the gate. But the user's last input was "go north" which led them to the Kitchenette. Now, the next step is to open the gate east. But the user's instruction says to check if the gate is opened. Wait, the user's original plan was: after opening the portal, check the gate in the kitchenette. So the next action is to open the gate. But the game's current state says the gate is closed. So the user needs to open it. Therefore, the next command should be "open gate east" or something similar. But in the game's context, maybe the command is just "open gate" or "open the gate". However, looking at the previous interactions, when the user tried to go north into the Kitchenette, the game responded with the gate being closed. So the user needs to open it. The correct action here is to open the gate. But the user's next move should be to open the gate. However, the user's instruction says to "make absolutely sure that the gate inside the kitchenette is opened." So the next action is to open the gate. Therefore, the correct command is "open gate".
