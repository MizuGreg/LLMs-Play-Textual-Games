It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! First stop, try to go to the west. Following that, make an effort to venture north. Next, venture east. Then, doublecheck that the portal is open. After that, make an effort to go to the north. Then, make absolutely sure that the gate inside the kitchenette is opened. After that, take a trip east. And then, pick-up the stick of butter from the floor of the cubicle. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Chamber =-
You are in a chamber.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

-= Basement =-
You've entered a basement. Let's see what's in here.

Hey, want to see a counter? Look over there, a counter. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it.

There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game and has already gone west from the chamber into the basement. The current location is the basement, which has a counter with nothing on it. The exits are east and north, both unblocked.

The original instructions mentioned going west, then north, east, checking the portal, going north again, ensuring the kitchenette gate is open, going east again, and picking up the butter stick. So far, the user has done the first two steps: going west (to the basement) and then the next step was supposed to be going north. Wait, the user's next action after entering the basement would be to go north as per the initial plan. But the user hasn't done that yet. The current prompt says "You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west." But they already went west once. Now, in the basement, the exits are east and north. The user's next step should be to go north as per the initial plan. The user's previous action was going west, and now they're in the basement. The next step in the sequence is to go north from the basement. So the correct command here is "go north".
</think>go north

-= Bedchamber =-
You are in a bedchamber. A normal one.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game and has been moving through different rooms: Chamber, Basement, now Bedchamber. The original instructions were to go west, then north, east, check the portal, go north again, ensure the kitchenette gate is open, go east, and pick up the butter stick.

So far, they've gone west from the Chamber to the Basement, then north to the Bedchamber. The next step according to the initial plan was to venture east. But in the Bedchamber, the available exits are east and south. The user's next action should be to go east as per the original plan. The current room is Bedchamber, and the exit to the east is unblocked. So the correct command here is "go east".

-= Spare Room =-
You arrive in a spare room. A standard kind of place.

You make out a toolbox. The toolbox is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a coffer. Oh, great. Here's a display. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. This always happens!

There is a closed portal leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

There is a passkey on the floor.

Okay, let's see. The user is navigating through different rooms in this text-based game. The original goal mentioned was to reach the original goal, but the exact objective isn't clear from the given information. The user has been moving through rooms: starting in the Chamber, then Basement, Bedchamber, Spare Room. The current room is the Spare Room, which has a closed portal north, an unguarded exit east, unblocked exit south, and a passkey on the floor.

The user's previous actions were: go west, go north, go east. Now, in the Spare Room, the next step might involve checking the passkey or trying to open the portal north. The original instructions mentioned checking if the portal is open, so maybe that's a key step. However, the user's next action should be based on the current room's description. The passkey is on the floor, so perhaps picking it up is important. But the user's task was to pick up the stick of butter from the cubicle later. However, in the Spare Room, there's no mention of a cubicle. Wait, maybe the cubicle is another room. Alternatively, the passkey might be a clue for opening the portal. The user needs to check if the portal is open, but it's closed. So maybe the passkey is needed to open it. The user should pick up the passkey first. But the user's previous actions didn't include picking up items yet. The original plan was to pick up the stick of butter from the cubicle after moving east, but maybe the passkey is part of the process. However, the user's next action should be based on the current room's options. The options are to go east, south, or west. The portal is closed north. The user might need to pick up the passkey first. But the user's instruction says to only output the command. So the next action could be to pick up the passkey, but the game's commands might not include picking up items unless specified. Wait, in the Spare Room description, there's a passkey on the floor. The user might need to pick it up. However, the game's commands might require using 'take' or 'pick up'. But the user's previous actions were 'go west', 'go north', 'go east', so maybe the next step is to pick up the passkey. But the user's instruction says to only output the command. So perhaps the correct next action is 'take passkey' or 'pick up passkey'. However, the game's commands might be limited to movement. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check the portal. But the portal is closed. So maybe the user needs to find a way to open it, which might require the passkey. But the user's next action should be to pick up the passkey. However, the user's previous actions didn't include picking up items. The original plan was to check the portal, but in the Spare Room, the portal is closed. So maybe the user needs to pick up the passkey first. But the user's next action should be based on the available commands. The available commands in the Spare Room are to go east, south, west, or maybe interact with the passkey. Since the user's previous actions were movement, maybe the next step is to pick up the passkey. However, the game might require using 'take' or 'get' commands. But the user's previous actions were all movement commands. So maybe the correct next action is 'take passkey'. But the user's instruction says to only output the command. So the answer would be 'take passkey' or 'pick up passkey'. However, in the game's context, maybe the correct command is 'take passkey'. But I need to check the game's possible commands. Since the user is in the Spare Room and there's a passkey on the floor, the next logical step is to pick it up. So the answer is 'take passkey'.
</think>take passkey
