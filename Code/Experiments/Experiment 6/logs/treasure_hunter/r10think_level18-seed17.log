Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, you could, like, move west. Then, ensure that the hatch is open. And then, make an attempt to head west. And then, doublecheck that the portal is ajar. And then, travel north. And then, open the door. After that, make an effort to go north. With that over with, pick-up the potato from the floor of the salon. Once that's all handled, you can stop!
