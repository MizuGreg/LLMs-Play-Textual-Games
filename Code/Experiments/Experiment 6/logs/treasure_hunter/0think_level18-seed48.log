Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, you could, like, go north. After that, open the passageway within the closet. Once you have opened the passageway, go to the west. After that, open the gate. And then, try to go to the south. And then, ensure that the door within the study is open. After opening the door, attempt to venture south. Once you do that, retrieve the keycard from the shelf. Got that? Good!

-= Spare Room =-
You are in a spare room. It seems to be pretty typical here. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

You see a workbench. The workbench is normal. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

-= Closet =-
You've just shown up in a closet. You start to take note of what's in the room.
