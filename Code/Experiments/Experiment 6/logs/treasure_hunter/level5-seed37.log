Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First stop, head east. Then, venture south. Then, retrieve the teapot from the floor of the dish-pit. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Laundry Place =-
You arrive in a laundry place. A normal one.



There is an unblocked exit to the east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked.

>                                                                                                                                -= Laundry Place =-0/1
AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go east

-= Canteen =-
Look at that notice! What does it say? It says Welcome to the canteen? Well that's cool. The room is well lit.



There is an unguarded exit to the north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

-= Dish-Pit =-
Ah, the dish-pit. This is some kind of dish-pit, really great ordinary vibes in this place, a wonderful ordinary atmosphere.



There is an unblocked exit to the north.

There is a teapot on the floor.
