I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! First step, head south. After that, make an attempt to travel west. And then, lift the grape from the floor of the bathroom. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Study =-
You find yourself in a study. An ordinary kind of place. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You smell a fine smell, and follow it to a coffer. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. The coffer contains a passkey. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Steam Room =-
You are in a steam room. A normal kind of place.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a table. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.
