You are now playing a exciting round of TextWorld! First of all, you could, like, head west. With that over with, venture north. And then, make an effort to venture north. After that, make an effort to go to the north. Then, make an attempt to travel west. If you can succeed at that, try to travel south. Okay, and then, pick up the sandwich from the floor of the lounge. Alright, thanks!

-= Laundromat =-
You've just sauntered into a laundromat.

You see a locked basket in the corner.

You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing a text-based game where they're moving between different locations like a laundromat and a canteen. The goal seems to be to reach a certain place, maybe the original starting point or a specific item like a sandwich.

Looking at the history, the user alternates between going west and east, which takes them back and forth between the laundromat and canteen. The locked basket in the laundromat and the open gateway north in the canteen are notable features. The user's instructions mention trying to go north multiple times, then west, then south, and finally picking up a sandwich.

But so far, the user has been moving west and east, which just switches locations. They haven't tried going north in the canteen, which might be a key step. The locked basket in the laundromat might be a clue, but the user hasn't interacted with it yet. The sandwich is mentioned as being on the floor of the lounge, but the current locations are laundromat and canteen. Maybe the user needs to find the right path to reach the lounge where the sandwich is.

The user's current position is the laundromat again after several back-and-forth moves. The next logical step might be to try going north from the canteen, as that's a direction mentioned in the initial instructions. But since the user is in the laundromat now, maybe they need to go east to the canteen again and then north. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to unlock the basket or find the sandwich through other means.

But according to the previous moves, the user hasn't successfully gone north from the canteen yet. The canteen has an open gateway north, so perhaps that's the way to go. The user needs to try going north from the canteen to progress. Since the last move was going west into the laundromat again, the next step should be to go east back to the canteen and then north. But the user might be stuck in a loop. Alternatively, maybe the locked basket needs to be unlocked, but there's no mention of a key or way to open it yet.

The original goal was to pick up the sandwich from the lounge. So the user needs to reach the lounge. The current locations are laundromat and canteen. Maybe the lounge is connected through another path. The user needs to find the correct sequence of moves to get to the lounge. Since the canteen has a north gateway, maybe that's the way to go. So the next action should be to go north from the canteen. But the user is currently in the laundromat, so they need to go east to the canteen again and then north. However, the user's last move was west, so the next step is to go east to the canteen again, then north. But the user might not realize that they need to go north from the canteen. The answer should be to go north from the canteen.

-= Shower =-
You've just sauntered into a shower.



There is an open gateway leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the west.



>                                                                                                                                -= Shower =-0/7

-= Bedchamber =-
You're now in the bedchamber. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?



There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the south. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

-= Lounge =-
Fancy seeing you here. Here, by the way, being the lounge. Let's see what's in here.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a bar. The bar is ordinary. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a couch. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The couch is typical. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You think about smashing the couch to bits, throwing the bits in the dump, etc, until you get bored. Look over there! a desk! Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is an unguarded exit to the east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

There is a sandwich on the floor.
