Welcome to TextWorld! Here is how to play! First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to venture north. With that over with, take a trip west. And then, make an effort to head north. Following that, attempt to travel west. Then, lift the latchkey from the floor of the kitchen. Alright, thanks!

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing a text adventure game and has been moving through different rooms. The goal mentioned earlier was to lift the latchkey from the kitchen floor. So far, the player has gone from the garage to the laundry place, back to the garage, then to the basement, cubicle, and closet. 

In the closet, there's an opened chest that's empty and a hatch leading south and a gateway west. The user is asking if they're on the right track and if they're close to the goal.

Hmm, the latchkey in the kitchen hasn't been mentioned yet. The player hasn't visited the kitchen yet. So far, the path has been through the garage, laundry, basement, cubicle, closet. Maybe they need to go back through the garage to the kitchen? Let me check the previous rooms.

In the garage, there's an unguarded exit to the north (which led to the laundry place) and west (which led to the basement). But the kitchen isn't mentioned in the garage description. Wait, maybe the kitchen is connected via another path. Or perhaps the player needs to find a way to get to the kitchen from the current location.

The closet has a hatch south, which would lead back to the cubicle. From the cubicle, there's an exit to the south (which is the basement?), but maybe there's another way. Alternatively, maybe the player needs to go back to the garage and then find another exit. But the original instructions mentioned lifting the latchkey from the kitchen floor. So the kitchen must be somewhere in the map.

Wait, in the garage, the user was told there's an unguarded exit to the north and west. The laundry place was north of the garage. Then the basement was west. But the kitchen isn't in any of those. Maybe the player needs to go back to the garage and then east? But the garage's north was the laundry, west was basement. Maybe the kitchen is connected via another path. Alternatively, maybe the player needs to go from the closet south to the cubicle, then east to the laundry place, then north to the garage, and then maybe east? Wait, the garage's east wasn't mentioned. Wait, the initial garage had exits north and west. So maybe the kitchen is connected via another exit that hasn't been explored yet.

Alternatively, maybe the player is supposed to go from the closet west through the gateway. The closet has a gateway west. So from the closet, go west to the cubicle? Wait, no, the closet's west is the gateway, which would lead to the cubicle? Wait, the cubicle is where the player was earlier. Let me check the room descriptions again.

In the closet, the player can go south (to the cubicle) or west (to the gateway). The cubicle has an open portal east, open hatch north, and exit south. So maybe the gateway west from the closet leads to another area. But the player is currently in the closet. The next step would be to check if there's a way to get to the kitchen. Since the kitchen hasn't been found yet, maybe the player needs to backtrack through the garage and find a different exit. But the garage only has north and west exits. Wait, maybe the player is supposed to go from the garage to the north (laundry), then east? But the laundry place said there's an open portal west (so back to garage) and suggested going east or south. Wait, in the laundry place, the player was told to try going east or south. The player went south back to the garage. So maybe the kitchen is connected via the east exit from the laundry place? But the laundry place's east exit wasn't described. Wait, the laundry place description says: "There is an open portal leading west. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south." So maybe the east exit from the laundry place is unguarded. If the player goes east from the laundry place, maybe that leads to the kitchen? But the player hasn't tried that yet.

So the current location is the closet. The player needs to get to the kitchen. The path from the closet is south to cubicle, then maybe east to laundry, then east again? Or maybe from the cubicle, go east to the laundry place, then east again. Wait, the cubicle has an open portal east. So from the cubicle, go east to the laundry place. Then from the laundry place, go east. If that leads to the kitchen, then that's the way. But the laundry place's east exit wasn't described. Alternatively, maybe the player needs to go from the cubicle north to the closet again. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the player is supposed to go from the closet west to the gateway, which might lead to another area. But the gateway is described as an open gateway leading west from the closet. Wait, the closet's description says: "There is an open hatch leading south. There is an open gateway leading west." So going west from the closet would lead to the gateway. But what's beyond that? The cubicle is where the player was before, but maybe that's not the right path.

Alternatively, maybe the player needs to go back through the cubicle to the basement, then to the garage, then to the kitchen. But the kitchen hasn't been mentioned yet. The original instruction was to lift the latchkey from the kitchen floor. So the player needs to find the kitchen.

Given that the player is in the closet, the next step would be to go south back to the cubicle, then east to the laundry place, then east again. But the laundry place's east exit isn't described. Alternatively, maybe the player should go from the cubicle north to the closet again. But that's not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe the player is supposed to go from the closet west to the gateway, which might lead to the kitchen. But the gateway's description isn't given. The user is in the closet, so the next action would be to go west through the gateway. But the user hasn't explored that yet. However, the user's previous steps were going north, west, etc., so maybe the correct path is to go back to the garage, then find another exit. But the garage only has north and west exits. Wait, maybe the player needs to go from the garage to the north (laundry), then east. But the laundry place's east exit is unguarded. So from the laundry place, go east. If that leads to the kitchen, then that's the way. But the player hasn't tried that yet.

So the current location is the closet. The player needs to get to the kitchen. The possible path is to go south to the cubicle, then east to the laundry place, then east again. But the laundry place's east exit is unguarded. So the next step would be to go south from the closet to the cubicle, then east to the laundry place, then east again. But the user hasn't done that yet. However, the user is asking if they're on the right track. Since the kitchen hasn't been found yet, maybe the player is not close yet. But the user needs to proceed.

So the next action would be to go south from the closet to the cubicle, then east to the laundry place, then east again. But the user is in the closet now. So the next command is to go south to the cubicle.
