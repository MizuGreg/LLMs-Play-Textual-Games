Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. Your first objective is to go to the east. With that done, attempt to go to the north. Then, make an effort to go to the east. And then, lift the sponge from the floor of the sauna. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Office =-
You arrive in an office. An usual kind of place. You start to take note of what's in the room.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded.

>                                                                                                                                -= Office =-0/1
AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go east
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Studio =-
You find yourself in a studio. An usual one.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.



>                                                                                                                                -= Studio =-0/2
AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go north
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unblocked exit to the south.



>                                                                                                                                -= Kitchen =-0/3

-= Sauna =-
You've just shown up in a sauna.



There is an unguarded exit to the west.

There is a sponge on the floor.

That's not a verb I recognise.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the instructions in the text game. Their goal is to go east, then north, then east again, and finally lift the sponge in the sauna. So far, they've gone east from the office to the studio, then north to the kitchen, then east again to the sauna. Now they're in the sauna and need to lift the sponge.

The user tried "lift sponge" and "lift the sponge", but the game didn't recognize them. The correct command might be "pick up sponge" or "take sponge". Since the game is text-based, maybe the verb is "take" instead of "lift". Let me check the previous interactions. The user was told there's a sponge on the floor, so the action should be to take it. The correct command is likely "take sponge". The user might have used "lift" instead of "take", which is why it didn't work. So the next action should be "take sponge".
