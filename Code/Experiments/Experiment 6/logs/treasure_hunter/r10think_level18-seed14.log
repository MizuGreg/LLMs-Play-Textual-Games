You are now playing a profound game of TextWorld! First, it would be good if you could open the gate inside the canteen. After that, attempt to go north. And then, ensure that the portal is open. And then, try to travel north. After that, go to the west. Then, go to the north. Next, make an attempt to head east. Following that, take the butterfly from the box inside the workshop. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Canteen =-
Well, here we are in a canteen.

You can see a chest. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You can make out a case.

There is a closed gate leading north. There is an open hatch leading west.
