Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, attempt to go to the east. And then, head east. After that, head south. Following that, ensure that the hatch is open. After you have pulled open the hatch, attempt to go south. That done, go west. Following that, open the gateway. And then, make an effort to venture west. After that, pick-up the latchkey from the floor of the bedroom. Alright, thanks!

-= Kitchenette =-
You arrive in a kitchenette. An ordinary kind of place.

You see a locked fridge in the corner. Look over there! a board. The board is typical. But there isn't a thing on it.

There is an open door leading east. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Guess what, you are in the place we're calling the workshop.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.

-= Scullery =-
Ah, the scullery. This is some kind of scullery, really great typical vibes in this place, a wonderful typical atmosphere. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

You can see a pan. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open passageway leading east. There is an open door leading west. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.
