You are now playing a exciting game of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First, it would be great if you could go west. After that, attempt to head north. And then, lift the banana from the floor of the workshop. And if you do that, you're the winner!

You find yourself in a canteen. A normal kind of place. You start to take note of what's in the room.



There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to complete the game where they need to go west, then north, and finally lift the banana. So far, they've gone west and north, ending up in the workshop. The banana is on the floor there.

The user has tried "lift the banana" multiple times, but the system keeps saying it's not a recognized verb. Maybe the correct command is just "lift banana" without "the"? Or perhaps there's a specific syntax required. Let me check the previous interactions.

In the workshop description, it says "There is a banana on the floor." So the banana is a noun here. In text adventures, sometimes you just use the noun without "the". So maybe the correct command is "lift banana" instead of "lift the banana". 

But the user has tried both variations and got the same error. Wait, maybe the game expects a different verb, like "take" instead of "lift"? But the original instruction says to "lift the banana". Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the banana is in a specific location, and you need to pick it up from there. 

Alternatively, maybe the game is case-sensitive. Let me check the previous commands. The user wrote "lift the banana" and the system said it's not recognized. Maybe the correct form is "lift banana" without "the". Let me try that. If that doesn't work, maybe "take banana" or "get banana". But the user's instruction was to lift it, so perhaps the correct command is indeed "lift banana". 

Alternatively, maybe the game requires using the article "the" but the system is case-sensitive. Wait, the user tried "lift the banana" and got an error. Maybe the correct command is "lift banana" without the article. Let me try that. If that's not working, maybe the game is expecting a different action. But according to the problem statement, the goal is to lift the banana, so that's the correct action. 

So the next step is to try "lift banana" without the article. If that doesn't work, maybe the game has a different command, but based on the instructions, that's the correct action. So the user should try that again.

<think>
Okay, the user is stuck in the Workshop room, trying to lift the banana. They've tried "lift the banana" and "lift banana" multiple times, but the game keeps saying it's not a recognized verb. Let me think about possible reasons.

First, maybe the correct command is "take banana" instead of "lift". Sometimes games use "take" for picking up items. Alternatively, "get banana" might work. But the original instruction said to "lift the banana", so maybe the game expects that exact phrase. However, the system is rejecting it.

Wait, maybe the banana is in a specific location. The description says "There is a banana on the floor." So perhaps the command is just "lift banana" without any article. But the user tried that and it didn't work. Maybe the game requires using the article "the" even though it's on the floor. But the user tried "lift the banana" and it was rejected.

Alternatively, maybe the game uses a different verb. Maybe "pick up banana" is the correct command. But the user's instruction was to lift it, so that's conflicting.

Another possibility is that the game is case-sensitive. The user might have used lowercase "lift" when it should be uppercase. But in the previous attempts, the user used lowercase, and the system responded with the same error. So that's probably not it.

Wait, maybe the banana is not considered a valid item to lift. But the description explicitly states it's on the floor, so it should be pickable. Maybe the game expects a different action, like "pick up" instead of "lift". Let me check the previous interactions. The user tried "lift the banana" and "lift banana", both rejected. So maybe the correct command is "take banana".

Alternatively, maybe the game is using a different syntax. For example, "lift banana" without the article. But the user tried that. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to first interact with the banana in some way. Like, "examine banana" to confirm it's there, then "lift banana". But the user hasn't done that yet.

But according to the problem statement, the goal is to lift the banana. So the correct action should be "lift banana". Since the system is rejecting it, maybe there's a typo or a different verb. But the user has tried all variations. Maybe the game is expecting "get banana" instead.

Alternatively, maybe the banana is not in the correct location. But the description says it's on the floor. So I think the correct command is "lift banana", but the system is not recognizing it. Maybe the game is case-sensitive, but the user used lowercase. Let me try "Lift Banana" with uppercase. But the user is supposed to only output the command, so maybe that's not allowed.

Alternatively, maybe the game is using a different verb like "pick up". So the user should try "pick up banana". But the original instruction says to lift it. However, the user is stuck, so maybe they need to try different verbs.

In this case, the user has tried all possible variations, so the next step is to try "take banana" or "get banana". But since the user's instruction was to lift, maybe the game is expecting "lift banana" but there's a mistake. However, the system keeps rejecting it. So perhaps the correct answer is to use "take banana".
