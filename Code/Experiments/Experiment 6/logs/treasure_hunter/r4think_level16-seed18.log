-= Bathroom =-
You've come into a typical room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be typical. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the bathroom.

You make out a cabinet. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a drawer. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a trunk.

There is an open passageway leading south. There is a closed walnut gate leading west.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text adventure game. The goal is to follow a series of steps: open the passageway, go north, open the walnut gate, go west, go south, retrieve the latchkey from the closet, and then win.

So far, they've arrived in the sauna, opened the passageway, went north to the bathroom. Now, in the bathroom, there's a cabinet, a drawer, a trunk. The directions are south (open passageway) and west (closed walnut gate). 

The next step according to the initial instructions was to open the walnut gate after going north. So the user needs to open the walnut gate west. But the current room is the bathroom, and the walnut gate is closed. So the next action should be to open the walnut gate. Then go west. Then go south, retrieve the latchkey from the closet. 

Wait, the user's last action was going north to the bathroom. Now, in the bathroom, the walnut gate is closed. So the next step is to open it. The user needs to open the walnut gate first before going west. So the correct command here is "open walnut gate".
