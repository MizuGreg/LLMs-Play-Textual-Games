Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is how to play! First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to make an attempt to travel west. Next, try to take a trip north. Following that, attempt to head west. Okay, and then, attempt to travel west. After that, head south. And then, attempt to move south. Once you do that, take a trip east. Then, try to venture east. Once you accomplish that, retrieve the tv from the floor of the salon. Alright, thanks!

-= Cookery =-

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

Look at you, bigshot, walking into a bar like it isn't some huge deal. The room is well lit.

You see an opened portmanteau, which looks typical, nearby. The portmanteau is empty, what a horrible day! If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a recliner. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a recliner? But there isn't a thing on it.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the west.
