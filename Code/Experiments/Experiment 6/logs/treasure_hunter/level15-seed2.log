Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an profound round of TextWorld? You do! Here is your task for today. First, it would be a great idea if you could try to move west. Next, venture south. With that over with, go to the east. And then, go to the south. If you can manage that, head west. Then, pick-up the latchkey from the floor of the studio. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Bedchamber =-
You arrive in a bedchamber. A normal one. You begin to take stock of what's here.



You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

-= Kitchen =-
You've entered a kitchen. Let's see what's in here.

You see a plate. The plate is ordinary. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is an open portal leading north. There is an unguarded exit to the east. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

Okay, let's break down the user's current situation. They're in the Kitchen, which is part of a TextWorld game. The goal mentioned earlier was to move in specific directions: west, south, east, south, west, then pick up the latchkey from the studio. So far, they've gone west from the Bedchamber to the Kitchen.

Looking at the Kitchen description: there's a plate, an open portal north, an unguarded exit east, and a south entrance. The user's next step should follow the initial instructions. The original plan was after moving west, then south, east, south, west, and then pick up the latchkey.

Wait, the user is in the Kitchen. The next step in the original task was to venture south from the Kitchen. But the Kitchen has a south exit. So the next action should be to go south. But let me check the current location again. The user is in the Kitchen, and the directions available are north (portal), east (unguarded exit), and south (entranceway). So going south from the Kitchen would take them back to the Bedchamber? Or maybe another room?

But the original instructions said after moving west (to Kitchen), then venture south (from Kitchen?), then go east, then south, then west, then pick up the latchkey. So the sequence is: Bedchamber -> Kitchen (west), then south from Kitchen. But the user is in the Kitchen now. So the next step is to go south. However, the user's previous action was going west, then the next step according to the original plan is to venture south. So the next command should be "go south".

But wait, the user is in the Kitchen. The Kitchen's south entrance is unguarded. So going south from the Kitchen would take them back to the Bedchamber. Then, according to the original plan, after that, they need to go east, then south, then west. But maybe the path is a loop. However, the user's task is to follow the directions as given. The original instructions said: first move west, then south, then east, then south, then west, then pick up the latchkey. So after the initial west to Kitchen, the next step is south. So the user should go south from the Kitchen. That's the next action.
</think>go south

-= Workshop =-
You arrive in a workshop. An ordinary one.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.



>                                                                                                                                -= Workshop =-0/3

Okay, let's see. The user is navigating through different rooms in a text-based game. The original task was to move west, then south, east, south, west, pick up the latchkey from the studio, and then stop. So far, they've gone from the bedchamber west to the kitchen, then south to the workshop.

Now, in the workshop, the directions mentioned are east, north, and south. The user's next move needs to follow the original plan. The original steps after the kitchen were to go east, then south. But wait, the user is currently in the workshop. The original instructions said after moving west, then south, then east, then south, then west. So maybe the current position is the workshop, and the next step is to go east as per the original plan. But the user's previous action was going south from the kitchen to the workshop. So the next step in the original plan was to go east from the workshop. But the workshop's description says there's an exit to the east, so going east would be the next move. However, the user's next action should be determined based on the original task. Let me check the original steps again.

Original steps: move west, south, east, south, west, pick up latchkey. So after the workshop, the next direction should be east. But the user is in the workshop. The workshop's exit is east, so going east would be the next step. But the user's previous action was going south to the workshop. So the next step is to go east. However, the user might need to check if the east exit is unguarded. The workshop's description says the east exit is unguarded, so that's allowed. So the next action should be go east. But wait, the user's next move is to go east from the workshop. Then, after that, the next step in the original plan is to go south. So after going east, they would then go south. But the user is currently in the workshop, so the next step is to go east. Therefore, the correct next action is go east.

-= Spare Room =-
You are in a spare room. A standard one. You begin looking for stuff.

You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a shelf. But there isn't a thing on it.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Okay, let's see. The user has been moving through different rooms in the game: bedchamber, kitchen, workshop, and now the spare room. The original task was to move west, then south, east, south, west, pick up the latchkey from the studio, and then stop.

So far, the user has gone west from the bedchamber to the kitchen, then south to the workshop, east to the spare room. Now, in the spare room, the next step according to the original instructions was to go west again. But the user is at the spare room, and the directions here are east, north, south, west—all unguarded. The original plan was after moving east from the workshop, then south, then west to pick up the latchkey. Wait, maybe the path is a loop? Or perhaps the spare room is part of the path.

Wait, the original instructions said: move west, then south, then east, then south, then west, then pick up the latchkey. So after the first west (to kitchen), then south to workshop, then east to spare room, then south? But in the spare room, the south exit is unblocked. So going south from the spare room would be the next step. But the user's current location is the spare room. The next action according to the original plan would be to go south from the spare room. But the user hasn't picked up the latchkey yet. The latchkey is in the studio, which might be a different room. So maybe after moving south from the spare room, they would reach the studio, where the latchkey is. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action should be to go south from the spare room. But the user's last action was going east to the spare room. So the next step is to go south. But the user's current location is the spare room, and the directions available are east, north, south, west. So the next action should be go south. But the user is supposed to go west, then south, then east, then south, then west. Wait, maybe the path is a loop, and the user is following the instructions step by step. Let me check the original steps again.

Original task: move west, then south, then east, then south, then west, then pick up the latchkey. So after the first west (bedchamber to kitchen), then south (kitchen to workshop), then east (workshop to spare room), then south (spare room to... where? Maybe the studio?), then west (from studio back to somewhere?), then pick up the latchkey. So the next step after the spare room is to go south. So the next action should be go south. But the user is at the spare room, and the south exit is unblocked. So the correct next action is go south.

-= Steam Room =-
You find yourself in a steam room. A typical one.

You can make out a box, so there's that. You make out a rack. The rack is typical. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can see a table. The table is normal. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.



>                                                                                                                                -= Steam Room =-0/5

The original task was to move in specific directions: west, south, east, south, west, then pick up the latchkey from the studio. So far, the user has gone west (to Kitchen), south (to Workshop), east (to Spare Room), south (to Steam Room). Now, the next step according to the original instructions was to go west after being in the Steam Room.

Looking at the current room, the Steam Room, the exits mentioned are east, north, and west. The user's next move should be west, as per the plan. The Steam Room's description mentions exits to east, north, and west. So the correct action here is to go west. The user hasn't picked up the latchkey yet, so continuing through the rooms as per the original path makes sense. The answer should be "go west".

-= Studio =-
You've just shown up in a studio. You can barely contain your excitement.

Oh, great. Here's a stand. The stand appears to be empty.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

There is a latchkey on the floor.

Okay, let me figure out what to do next. The user's goal is to pick up the latchkey from the floor of the studio. So far, they've navigated through several rooms: bedchamber, kitchen, workshop, spare room, steam room, and now the studio. The last room, the studio, has the latchkey on the floor.

The current prompt says, "There is a latchkey on the floor." So the next logical step is to pick it up. The user's previous actions have been moving around the rooms, and now they're in the studio where the latchkey is located. The instruction says to pick it up once they're there. So the correct command here would be "take latchkey" or "pick up latchkey". But in the context of TextWorld, the exact command might be "take latchkey". Let me check the previous interactions. The user was told to "pick-up the latchkey from the floor of the studio." So the correct action is to take it. Therefore, the next command should be "take latchkey".
