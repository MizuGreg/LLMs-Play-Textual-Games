Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is how to play! First thing I need you to do is to venture east. And then, move north. Then, pick-up the passkey from the floor of the bedroom. That's it!

-= Chamber =-
You find yourself in a chamber. An usual kind of place.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

There is a cd on the floor.

AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go east

-= Workshop =-
You find yourself in a workshop. A normal one. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.



There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go north
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Bedroom =-
You find yourself in a bedroom. An ordinary one.



You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

There is a passkey on the floor.


>                                                                                                                                -= Bedroom =-0/3
