Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. Your first objective is to attempt to take a trip west. With that done, head south. Then, make an effort to move south. With that over with, retrieve the cauliflower from the floor of the study. Alright, thanks!

-= Studio =-
You've entered a studio.

You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a suitcase. Now why would someone leave that there?

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

go west

-= Shower =-
You are in a shower. An ordinary one.

You can see a board. However, the board, like an empty board, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You can see a table. The table is typical. But there isn't a thing on it.

There is an unguarded exit to the east. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

go south

-= Bedroom =-
You're now in the bedroom. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You can make out a bed. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The bed is usual. However, the bed, like an empty bed, has nothing on it. What's the point of an empty bed?

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

-= Study =-
You are in a study. A standard one. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.



There is an unguarded exit to the north.

There is a cauliflower on the floor.
