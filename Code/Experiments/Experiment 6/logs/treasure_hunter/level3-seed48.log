Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to move north. Then, retrieve the keycard from the floor of the studio. That's it!

-= Closet =-
You arrive in a closet. A normal kind of place.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north.

go north

-= Studio =-
You are in a studio.



There is an unguarded exit to the east. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

There is a keycard on the floor.
