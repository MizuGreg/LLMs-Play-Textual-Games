Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First stop, head north. With that accomplished, try to take a trip north. Then, move west. Then, make an attempt to head south. Then, go west. Once you get around to doing that, pick up the fly larva from the floor of the cookhouse. Got that? Good!

-= Bedroom =-
Well, here we are in the bedroom. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.



There is an unblocked exit to the north.

You're now in a shower.



There is an open door leading north. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

Well, here we are in a cubicle. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.



There is an open door leading south. There is an open gateway leading west.

-= Study =-
Of every study you could have walked into, you had to come round an usual one. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You see a locked coffer. You make out a trunk. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You scan the room for a stand, and you find a stand. The stand is typical. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is an open gateway leading east. There is an open gate leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game and has been following the instructions to move through different rooms. The goal is to pick up the fly larva from the cookhouse. So far, they've gone from the bedroom north to the shower, then west to the cubicle, and then west again into the study. Now they're in the Study room.

The current room is the Study. The description mentions a locked coffer, a trunk, a stand with nothing on it, and exits to east, west, and south. The user is asking if they're making the right moves and if they're close to the goal. 

Let me recap the path taken so far. The initial directions were to go north from the bedroom, then north again from the shower, then west to the cubicle, then west again to the study. The original plan was to go north, then north again, then west, then west, then pick up the fly larva in the cookhouse. But the current location is the Study, which is the fourth room in that sequence. 

Wait, maybe the path isn't correct. Let me check the rooms again. The first move was north from the bedroom, which led to the shower. Then north again from the shower to the cubicle. Then west from the cubicle to the study. But the original instructions said after moving west from the cubicle, the next step was to go west again. But in the Study room, the exits are east, west, and south. So going west from the Study would take them to another room, perhaps the cookhouse? Or maybe the cookhouse is south from the Study. 

Wait, the user's original plan was: after moving west from the cubicle (which is the third step), then go west again. But in the Study room, the exit to the west is available. So maybe going west from the Study would lead to the cookhouse. But the user hasn't picked up the fly larva yet. The fly larva is in the cookhouse. So perhaps the next step is to go west from the Study to reach the cookhouse, then pick up the larva. 

But the user is asking if they're on the right track. The current room is the Study. The next logical step would be to go west from the Study to reach the cookhouse. Alternatively, maybe the cookhouse is south from the Study. The description says in the Study room, there's an unblocked exit to the south. So maybe going south from the Study would lead to the cookhouse. But the user's original plan was to go west twice, then pick up the larva. 

Wait, the original instructions were: first, go north (from bedroom), then take a trip north (so maybe another north from shower?), then move west (from cubicle), then make an attempt to head south (from cubicle?), then go west again. But the user's path has been bedroom -> shower -> cubicle -> study. So maybe the next step is to go south from the Study to reach the cookhouse. But the user's original plan was to go west twice. Hmm, maybe there's a confusion in the path. 

Alternatively, maybe the cookhouse is in the Study room. But the Study room has a locked coffer and a trunk, but no fly larva mentioned. The fly larva is in the cookhouse. So the user needs to reach the cookhouse. The Study's south exit might lead to the cookhouse. So the next step would be to go south from the Study. But the user's original plan was to go west again. However, the Study's west exit is available. Maybe the cookhouse is west of the Study. 

But the user is in the Study, and the next action is to decide whether to go west or south. The user is asking if they're on the right track. The user's original plan was to go north, north, west, west, then pick up the larva. But after the third step (west from cubicle), they are in the Study. Then the fourth step was supposed to be west again. But in the Study, going west is possible. So maybe that's the right move. 

Alternatively, maybe the cookhouse is south of the Study. The user's original plan said after moving west from the cubicle, then make an attempt to head south. But the user is now in the Study. So maybe the next step is to go south from the Study. 

But the user's original plan was to go west again. So perhaps the correct next step is to go west from the Study. But the Study's west exit leads to another room. Let me check the room descriptions again. 

In the Study room, the exits are east, west, and south. The user is in the Study. The original plan was to go west twice. So after the Study, going west would be the fourth step. Then, perhaps the cookhouse is in that direction. 

Alternatively, maybe the cookhouse is south of the Study. The user's original plan was to go south after moving west from the cubicle. But that might not be the case. 

The user is asking if they're close to the goal. The fly larva is in the cookhouse. So the user needs to reach the cookhouse. The Study's south exit might be the way. So the next step would be to go south from the Study. 

But according to the original plan, after moving west from the cubicle (third step), the user was supposed to make an attempt to head south (fourth step). But in the Study, the south exit is available. So maybe that's the right move. 

But the user is now in the Study, and the next action is to go south. However, the user's original plan was to go west again. But the Study's west exit is available. 

This is a bit confusing. The user needs to pick up the fly larva in the cookhouse. So the correct path would be to reach the cookhouse. The Study's south exit might lead to the cookhouse. So the next step is to go south. 

Alternatively, maybe the cookhouse is west of the Study. So going west from the Study would lead to the cookhouse. 

But the user's original plan was to go west twice. So after the Study, going west again would be the fourth step. Then, perhaps the cookhouse is there. 

But the user is in the Study, and the next action is to decide between west or south. The user is asking if they're on the right track. The user's original plan was to go north, north, west, west, then pick up the larva. But the current location is the Study, which is the fourth room. So the next step should be to go west again. 

But in the Study, going west is possible. So the next action would be to go west. 

Alternatively, maybe the cookhouse is south of the Study. The user's original plan said after moving west from the cubicle, then make an attempt to head south. So maybe that's the next step. 

But the user is in the Study, and the south exit is available. So the next step would be to go south. 

This is a bit unclear. However, the user's original plan was to go west twice. So after the Study, going west again would be the next step. Therefore, the correct action is to go west.

-= Launderette =-
You arrive in a launderette. A typical kind of place.

You can see a bench. The bench is ordinary. However, the bench, like an empty bench, has nothing on it.

There is an open gate leading east. There is an open portal leading south. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.



>                                                                                                                                -= Launderette =-0/5

-= Cookhouse =-
You're now in the cookhouse.

You can make out a locked case, which looks usual, in the room.

There is an open portal leading north. There is an open hatch leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a fly larva on the floor.


>                                                                                                                                -= Cookhouse =-0/6
Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me see. The user has been navigating through the rooms according to the initial instructions. They started in the bedroom, went north to the shower, then north again to the cubicle, west to the study, west again to the launderette, and then south to the cookhouse. Now they're in the cookhouse, which is where the fly larva is located.

The original goal was to pick up the fly larva from the cookhouse. The user has arrived at the cookhouse, and the larva is on the floor. The next logical step is to pick it up. However, the available commands are to go north, south, or east. Since the larva is on the floor, the user needs to pick it up, but the game's commands might not include picking up items unless specified. Wait, in the previous rooms, the user was able to interact with objects like the coffer and trunk, but here, the description mentions a locked case and the fly larva on the floor. 

The user's last action was going south to the cookhouse. Now, in the cookhouse, the fly larva is present. The correct action would be to pick it up. But the game's interface might require using a specific command like "take fly larva" or something similar. However, the user's instructions say to only output the action, like "go north". But in this case, the action is to pick up the larva. However, the game's previous interactions didn't use "take" commands, so maybe the correct action is to pick it up directly. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check the floor or interact with the larva. 

But the user's original plan was to pick up the fly larva from the cookhouse. Since they're now in the cookhouse and the larva is on the floor, the next step is to pick it up. However, the available commands in the cookhouse are north, south, east. The user might need to use a command like "take fly larva" or "get fly larva". But the user's previous actions were all "go" commands. Maybe the game expects the user to pick it up by interacting with the floor. But the description says "there is a fly larva on the floor", so the correct action is to pick it up. However, the user's instructions say to only output the action, so maybe the answer is "take fly larva". But the user's previous actions were all movement commands. Wait, the initial instructions said to "pick up the fly larva from the floor of the cookhouse". So the correct action here is to pick it up. But the game's interface might require using the "take" command. However, the user's previous actions were all "go" commands. Maybe the game allows picking up items by just being in the room. But the user needs to explicitly pick it up. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to just pick it up, and the game will accept that. So the next action is to pick up the fly larva. But the user's previous actions were movement commands, so maybe the correct answer here is "take fly larva". However, the user's instructions say to only output the command, so the answer is "take fly larva". But I need to check the game's possible commands. Since the user is in the cookhouse, and the larva is on the floor, the correct action is to pick it up. Therefore, the next command is "take fly larva".
