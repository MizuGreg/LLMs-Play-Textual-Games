Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First stop, go west. And then, try to head south. After that, make an attempt to venture west. Next, attempt to travel north. Following that, try to take a trip north. And then, attempt to go to the north. That done, venture east. Following that, make an effort to take a trip north. If you can finish that, lift the loaf of bread from the floor of the dish-pit. Got that? Good!

-= Lounge =-
You find yourself in a lounge. A normal kind of place. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?



You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

This might come as a shock to you, but you've just walked into a pantry. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You make out a shelf. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the shelf.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

-= Bedchamber =-
You arrive in a bedchamber. A typical one. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a bookshelf. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a bar. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

You arrive in a washroom. An usual kind of place. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You can see a bench. On the bench you can make out a latchkey.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text adventure game, and their goal is to lift the loaf of bread from the dish-pit. So far, they've moved through several rooms: Lounge, Pantry, Bedchamber, Washroom, Kitchen, Cookery, Cookhouse, and back to Cookery.

Looking at the current room, Cookery, the description mentions a pan but nothing on it. The exits are north, east, south, and west. The user has been moving between these rooms, but hasn't found the bread yet. The dish-pit is mentioned in the original instruction, so maybe it's in a different room.

The user's previous actions have been moving west, south, north, etc., but they haven't encountered the dish-pit. The bread is supposed to be in the dish-pit, so perhaps the dish-pit is in the Kitchen or another room. The Kitchen had a platter that was empty, but maybe the dish-pit is a different location.

Wait, in the Kitchen description, there's a rack and a platter, but nothing on them. The dish-pit might be a separate object. The user needs to find the dish-pit and then lift the bread from it. So far, the user hasn't found the dish-pit. They might need to check the Kitchen again or look for a different room.

The current room is Cookery. The exits are north, east, south, west. The user has already tried going west, which led back to Cookery. Maybe they need to check the north exit again. The Cookery's north exit leads to the Cookhouse, which they've been in before. Alternatively, maybe the dish-pit is in the Kitchen, and the user needs to check there again.

But in the Kitchen, the platter and rack are empty. Maybe the bread is in the dish-pit, which is a different object. The user hasn't interacted with any objects except the latchkey in the Washroom. So perhaps they need to look for the dish-pit in the Kitchen or another room.

Since the user is currently in Cookery, maybe they should try going east to the Cookhouse again, but that's already been done. Alternatively, check the north exit again. Wait, the Cookery's north exit is unblocked. Maybe the dish-pit is in the north direction. But the user hasn't checked that yet.

Alternatively, maybe the dish-pit is in the Kitchen, and the user needs to go back to the Kitchen and check again. The user's last move was west from Cookhouse to Cookery. So perhaps they need to go back to the Kitchen via the south exit from Cookery. Let me check the previous steps.

The user was in Cookhouse, then went west to Cookery. From Cookery, the south exit is unblocked. So going south from Cookery would take them back to the Kitchen. Then, in the Kitchen, maybe they can find the dish-pit. The original instruction says to lift the bread from the dish-pit, so the dish-pit must be in the Kitchen. The platter and rack are empty, but maybe the dish-pit is a different object. The user needs to check the Kitchen again.

So the next action should be to go south from Cookery to the Kitchen, then look for the dish-pit. But the user's current location is Cookery. The next step is to go south to the Kitchen. Then, in the Kitchen, maybe they can find the dish-pit and lift the bread. Therefore, the correct next action is to go south.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's recap. The user's goal is to lift the loaf of bread from the dish-pit. So far, they've explored several rooms: Lounge, Pantry, Bedchamber, Washroom, Kitchen, Cookery, Cookhouse, and back to Kitchen. In the Kitchen, they've checked all directions but haven't found the dish-pit or the bread.

The user tried looking in all directions (north, south, east, west) in the Kitchen but didn't find anything. The dish-pit must be somewhere, but it's not listed in the current description. Maybe the dish-pit is a hidden object or requires a specific action to discover. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check another room that hasn't been explored yet.

Wait, the user was in the Cookery and then went south to the Kitchen. The Cookery's exits include east, north, south, west. The user has already checked all those. The Kitchen's exits are north and south. The user has been moving between these rooms but hasn't found the dish-pit. Maybe the dish-pit is in the Cookhouse? Or perhaps the user needs to check the Rack or Platter again. But the Rack and Platter are described as empty. 

Alternatively, maybe the dish-pit is in the Washroom? The Washroom had a latchkey. But the user hasn't checked there in a while. Or maybe the dish-pit is in the Bedchamber? The Bedchamber had a bar that was empty. 

Wait, the original instruction mentioned the dish-pit, so it's likely in the Kitchen. But the user hasn't found it yet. Maybe the user needs to look more carefully. However, the game's responses indicate that the user can't see the dish-pit. Maybe the user needs to interact with an object to find it. For example, checking the rack or platter again. But the rack and platter are described as empty. 

Alternatively, maybe the dish-pit is a different object that's not listed. The user might need to use a different command, like 'open' or 'examine' to find it. But the user's previous actions have been moving around. Since the user is stuck, maybe the next step is to try a different approach, like checking the rack again or looking for a hidden object. However, the game's responses don't indicate any hidden objects. 

Given that the user has tried all exits and looked in all directions without success, maybe the dish-pit is in a room the user hasn't explored yet. But according to the previous steps, the user has been moving through the rooms. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go back to the Cookhouse and check again. But the user is currently in the Kitchen. 

Wait, the user is in the Kitchen, and the only exits are north and south. The user has already checked those. Maybe the dish-pit is in the north exit (Cookery) or south exit (back to Cookery). But the user hasn't found it there. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check the platter again. The platter is normal but empty. Maybe the bread is on the platter, but it's not mentioned. The user might need to look more carefully. However, the game's responses indicate that the user can't see anything. 

At this point, the user might be stuck. The next action could be to try a different command, like 'look' again, but the user has already done that. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check the rack again. But the rack is described as typical and empty. 

Since the user is in the Kitchen and hasn't found the dish-pit, the next logical step is to check the north exit again, which leads back to Cookery. But the user has already been there. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go back to the Cookhouse and check again. 

But according to the game's structure, the user might need to find the dish-pit in the Kitchen. Since the user hasn't found it yet, maybe the next action is to look around again, but the user has already done that. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use a different command, like 'open' or 'use' the platter or rack. But the game's responses don't indicate that. 

Given the information, the user is stuck and needs to try a different approach. The next action should be to go back to the Cookery and check again, but the user is already in the Kitchen. The only way is to go north back to Cookery. So the next command is 'go north' to return to Cookery and check again.

Okay, the user is trying to find the dish-pit with the bread. They've been moving through various rooms: Lounge, Pantry, Bedchamber, Washroom, Kitchen, Cookery, Cookhouse, and back. They've checked all directions in the Kitchen and Cookery but haven't found the dish-pit. The game's responses indicate that the dish-pit isn't visible in the current rooms.

Maybe the dish-pit is in a room they haven't explored yet. Wait, the user started in the Lounge, then went west to Pantry, then south to Bedchamber, west again to Washroom, south to Kitchen, north to Cookery, west to Cookhouse, then back to Cookery. They haven't checked the east exit from Cookery. The Cookery's east exit is unguarded. Maybe the dish-pit is there. Let me check the previous steps. When the user was in Cookery, they tried east, but the response was "You see nothing unexpected in that direction." But maybe the dish-pit is in that direction. The user hasn't checked east again. So the next action should be to go east from Cookery.

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

This might come as a shock to you, but you've just walked into a pantry. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You make out a shelf. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the shelf.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

You arrive in a bedchamber. A typical one. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a bookshelf. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a bar. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, the user is stuck in a loop, repeatedly moving between the Bedchamber, Washroom, Pantry, and Lounge. They've checked all exits multiple times but haven't found the dish-pit with the bread. The game's responses indicate that the dish-pit isn't in any of the rooms they've explored so far. Maybe the dish-pit is in a room they haven't checked yet, but according to the history, they've been moving through the same rooms over and over.

Alternatively, maybe the dish-pit is in the Kitchen, which they've passed through earlier. The user might have missed it earlier. But in the Kitchen, the rack and platter are empty. The user needs to check the Kitchen again. However, the user is currently in the Bedchamber. The next step should be to go back to the Kitchen via the north exit from the Bedchamber. But the Bedchamber's north exit is unguarded. So the next action should be to go north from the Bedchamber to the Kitchen.
