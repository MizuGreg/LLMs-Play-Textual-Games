I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is how to play! First step, take a trip north. Then, try to head west. If you can manage that, attempt to venture west. And then, move south. Once you accomplish that, try to venture south. Then, make an attempt to venture east. Okay, and then, retrieve the stick of butter from the floor of the bathroom. That's it!

-= Shower =-
You are in a shower. A standard kind of place. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. The counter is standard. The counter appears to be empty.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

-= Cubicle =-
Ah, the cubicle. This is some kind of cubicle, really great usual vibes in this place, a wonderful usual atmosphere. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a stand. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. This always happens! You see a bookshelf. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just an armchair. The armchair is ordinary. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You make out a chair. However, the chair, like an empty chair, has nothing on it.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Well, here we are in the closet. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

-= Basement =-
Look around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a basement.

You see a crate. You see a shelf. You shudder, but continue examining the shelf. The shelf is normal. However, the shelf, like an empty shelf, has nothing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You smell an intriguing smell, and follow it to a rack. The rack is typical. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Bedroom =-
You've entered a bedroom. Let's see what's in here.

You can see a bar. The bar is standard. But there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the bar.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unblocked exit to the north.

Well I'll be, you are in a place we're calling a bathroom.

As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a case. Classic TextWorld. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this?

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

There is a stick of butter on the floor.
