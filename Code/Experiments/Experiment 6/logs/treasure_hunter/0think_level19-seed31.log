You are now playing a life changing round of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First, it would be great if you could attempt to move west. And then, ensure that the hatch is open. After that, go to the south. And then, open the gateway in the basement. If you have opened the gateway, attempt to take a trip south. Following that, doublecheck that the gate in the vault is ajar. After pulling open the gate, take a trip west. And then, make an effort to head north. With that done, retrieve the broccoli from the saucepan. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Bedroom =-
You've entered a bedroom. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."

Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a suitcase. Classic TextWorld. You scan the room for a portmanteau, and you find a portmanteau. Now why would someone leave that there? You can see a closed box.

You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.
