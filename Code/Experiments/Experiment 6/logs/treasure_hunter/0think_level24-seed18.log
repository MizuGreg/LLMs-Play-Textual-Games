Welcome to another exciting session of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First, it would be great if you could head west. And then, retrieve the fresh laundry scented key from the floor of the shower. Then, make it so that the fresh laundry scented door within the shower is unlocked. Then, ensure that the fresh laundry scented door is open. After you have opened the fresh laundry scented door, attempt to travel north. And then, make an effort to take a trip east. And then, make it so that the portal in the studio is opened. Then, make an effort to go to the north. And then, retrieve the latchkey from the floor of the cubicle. And once you've done that, you win!
