Welcome to TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First thing I need you to do is to venture south. Then, attempt to head east. Next, travel south. Okay, and then, pick up the teapot from the floor of the dish-pit. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Workshop =-
You arrive in a workshop. An usual one.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.
