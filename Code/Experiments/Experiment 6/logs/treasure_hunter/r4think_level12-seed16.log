Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First, it would be good if you could make an effort to travel north. That done, attempt to go west. Following that, pick-up the peanut from the floor of the studio. Got that? Good!

-= Cubicle =-
Guess what, you are in the place we're calling the cubicle. You begin looking for stuff.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a safe. You can see a closed locker. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a desk. But the thing is empty.

There is an open passageway leading east. There is an open gateway leading north. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

-= Steam Room =-
Well how about that, you are in a place we're calling a steam room. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.



There is an open gateway leading south. There is an open door leading west.

-= Studio =-
You arrive in a studio. A standard one.

There is a peanut on the floor.
