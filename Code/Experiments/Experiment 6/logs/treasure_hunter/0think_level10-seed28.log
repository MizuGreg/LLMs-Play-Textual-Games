I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is how to play! First stop, try to go to the east. Then, head south. Then, go east. With that over with, go north. And then, pick up the passkey from the floor of the laundry place. And once you've done that, you win!
