It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First off, try to go east. After that, ensure that the portal inside the spare room is open. After that, venture north. Then, doublecheck that the gate is open. After that, make an effort to go to the east. Then, recover the stick of butter from the floor of the cubicle. Got that? Good!

-= Bedchamber =-
You are in a bedchamber. A normal one.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Spare Room =-
You arrive in a spare room. A standard kind of place.

You make out a toolbox. The toolbox is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a coffer. Oh, great. Here's a display. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. This always happens!

There is a closed portal leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

There is a passkey on the floor.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game called TextWorld. The current scene is the Spare Room. The user has already gone east from the Bedchamber into the Spare Room. Now, the instructions mentioned ensuring the portal inside the spare room is open. The current description says there's a closed portal leading north. So the next step should be to open that portal.

But how do you open it? The user found a passkey on the floor. Maybe they need to pick up the passkey first. The passkey might be required to open the portal. So the logical steps would be: pick up the passkey, then use it to open the portal. But the user's next action should be based on the available commands. The description mentions the passkey is on the floor, so the first thing is to take it. Then, perhaps use the passkey on the portal. But the user's next action should be the immediate command. Since the passkey is on the floor, the first action is to pick it up. Then, after that, try to open the portal. But according to the initial instructions, after entering the Spare Room, the user needs to ensure the portal is open. So the next step is to open the portal. But to open it, they might need the passkey. So the user should first pick up the passkey. Wait, the user hasn't picked it up yet. The current prompt says "There is a passkey on the floor." So the next action should be to take the passkey. Then, perhaps use it on the portal. But the user's next action is to take the passkey. So the answer should be "take passkey". But the user's previous action was "go east", leading to the Spare Room. Now, the next step is to take the passkey. Then, after that, try to open the portal. But the user's next action is to take the passkey. So the correct command here is "take passkey".
