Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a cabinet. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see an opened refrigerator right there by you. The refrigerator contains a keycard.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked.
