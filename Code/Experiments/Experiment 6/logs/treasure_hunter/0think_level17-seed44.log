Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an fast paced round of TextWorld? You do! First of all, you could, like, go west. And then, make an attempt to go north. After that, venture east. And then, make an effort to move north. With that over with, move west. With that accomplished, venture west. With that done, retrieve the broom from the floor of the attic. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Canteen =-
You arrive in a canteen. A standard one.

You scan the room for a chair, and you find a chair. However, the chair, like an empty chair, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is an open door leading north. There is an unguarded exit to the south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

-= Bedroom =-
I am sorry to announce that you are now in the bedroom. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?



There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

There is a tablet on the floor.
