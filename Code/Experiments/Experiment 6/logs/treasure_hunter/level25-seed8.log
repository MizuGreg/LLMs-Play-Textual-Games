You are now playing a life changing session of TextWorld! First thing I need you to do is to go west. Then, attempt to head west. Okay, and then, attempt to take a trip south. Then, head east. Following that, attempt to take a trip east. And then, travel south. And then, try to go to the west. Then, venture west. That done, make an attempt to travel west. Then, make an attempt to travel south. With that accomplished, pick-up the spork from the floor of the cookery. Alright, thanks!

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text adventure game, and they've been moving around different rooms: Kitchenette, Studio, Shower, Playroom, and Laundry Place. The goal mentioned earlier was to pick up a spork from the cookery. 

Looking at the current location, the user is in the Playroom again after moving back and forth between the Playroom and Laundry Place. The instructions given initially were to go west, then attempt to head west again, take a trip south, head east, etc. But now, after several loops between the Playroom and Laundry Place, the user is stuck in a cycle.

The key here is to check if the spork is in the cookery, which was mentioned in the original goal. The first room the user entered was the Kitchenette, which is likely where the cookery is. However, the user has been moving through other rooms without returning to the Kitchenette. The Laundry Place and Playroom don't seem to have the spork based on the descriptions provided.

The user's current position is the Playroom, and the exits are south, east, north, and west. The Laundry Place is to the west, and the Playroom is connected to the Laundry Place. But the spork is in the cookery, which is in the Kitchenette. The user hasn't returned to the Kitchenette since the beginning. 

So, the next logical step would be to go back to the Kitchenette. From the Playroom, the exit to the south is an open gate, which might lead back to the Kitchenette. However, in the previous steps, when the user tried going south from the Playroom, they ended up in the Laundry Place. Wait, that's conflicting. Let me check the history again.

Wait, the user started in the Kitchenette, then went west to the Studio, then west again to the Shower, then south to the Playroom. Then they kept moving west and east between the Playroom and Laundry Place. So the Playroom is connected to the Laundry Place via west and east. But the original path to the Kitchenette was through the south exit from the Playroom? Or was that a different direction?

Looking back at the initial steps: After the first move west from Kitchenette, the user went to Studio, then west again to Shower, then south to Playroom. Then, from Playroom, the exits are south (open gate), east, north, and west (Laundry Place). So the south exit from Playroom would lead to another room, maybe the Kitchenette? But in the previous steps, when the user tried going south from Playroom, they ended up in the Laundry Place. That doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe there's a mistake in the room connections.

Alternatively, maybe the user is stuck in a loop between Playroom and Laundry Place and hasn't returned to the Kitchenette. The original goal was to pick up the spork from the cookery, which is in the Kitchenette. Therefore, the user needs to return to the Kitchenette. But how?

Looking at the current position: Playroom. The exits are south (open gate), east, north, and west (Laundry Place). If the south exit from Playroom leads to the Kitchenette, then the user should go south. But in the previous steps, when the user tried going south from Playroom, they ended up in the Laundry Place. That suggests that maybe the south exit from Playroom is not to the Kitchenette but to another room. However, the initial description of the Playroom said there's an open gate leading south. Maybe that's a mistake in the game's setup, or perhaps the user needs to find another way.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go back through the Laundry Place to the Playroom and then find another exit. But the user has been moving back and forth between those two rooms. The problem is that the user hasn't returned to the Kitchenette, which is where the spork is. Therefore, the correct action would be to go back to the Kitchenette. But how?

Wait, the initial movement was from Kitchenette to Studio to Shower to Playroom. So the Playroom is connected to the Shower (south?), and the Kitchenette is connected to the Playroom via the south exit. But in the game's description, when the user was in the Playroom, the south exit was an open gate. However, in the previous steps, when the user tried going south from Playroom, they ended up in the Laundry Place. That suggests that the south exit from Playroom is not the correct path to the Kitchenette. Therefore, maybe the user needs to find another way.

Alternatively, perhaps the user needs to go east from the Playroom to the Laundry Place, then west back to Playroom, and then find another exit. But this seems like a loop. The user needs to get back to the Kitchenette. Maybe the correct path is to go north from the Playroom, but the description says the north exit is unguarded. However, the user hasn't explored that yet.

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go back through the Laundry Place to the Playroom and then find the spork. But the spork is in the cookery, which is in the Kitchenette. Therefore, the user needs to return to the Kitchenette. But how?

This is confusing. The user has been moving between Playroom and Laundry Place, but hasn't returned to the Kitchenette. The initial steps were: Kitchenette -> Studio -> Shower -> Playroom. So the Playroom is connected to the Shower (south?), and the Kitchenette is connected to the Playroom via the south exit. But in the game's description, when the user was in the Playroom, the south exit was an open gate, but when they tried going south, they ended up in the Laundry Place. That suggests that the south exit from Playroom is not the correct path. Therefore, maybe the user needs to go east from Playroom to Laundry Place, then west back to Playroom, and then find another exit. But the user hasn't found the spork yet.

Wait, the original goal was to pick up the spork from the cookery. The cookery is in the Kitchenette. So the user needs to return to the Kitchenette. But how? The user is currently in the Playroom. The exits from Playroom are south (open gate), east, north, and west (Laundry Place). If the south exit is not leading back to the Kitchenette, then perhaps the user needs to go north from Playroom. But the north exit is unguarded. However, the user hasn't explored that yet.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go back through the Laundry Place to the Playroom and then find another way. But the user is stuck in a loop. The only way to get back to the Kitchenette is to find the correct path. Since the user hasn't returned to the Kitchenette yet, the next step should be to go back to the Kitchenette. But how?

Wait, the initial movement was from Kitchenette to Studio to Shower to Playroom. So the Playroom is connected to the Shower (south?), and the Kitchenette is connected to the Playroom via the north exit? Or maybe the Playroom is connected to the Kitchenette via the south exit. But in the game's description, when the user was in the Playroom, the south exit was an open gate, but going south led to the Laundry Place. That's conflicting.

This suggests that there might be an error in the game's setup, but assuming the game is correct, the user needs to find the correct path. The user's goal is to pick up the spork in the cookery, which is in the Kitchenette. Therefore, the user needs to return to the Kitchenette. The only way to do that is to find the correct exit from the Playroom. Since the user has been going back and forth between Playroom and Laundry Place, maybe the correct path is to go north from Playroom. But the user hasn't tried that yet.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east from Playroom to Laundry Place, then west back to Playroom, and then go south again. But that's not working. The user needs to find the correct path to the Kitchenette.

Given the confusion, the user should try going north from the Playroom, as that's the only other exit not yet explored. If that leads back to the Kitchenette, then the user can pick up the spork. Otherwise, maybe the user needs to find another way. But based on the initial steps, the user needs to go back to the Kitchenette to get the spork.

-= Cubicle =-
You are in a cubicle. A normal kind of place.

You can make out a coffer. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. What's that over there? It looks like it's a desk. The desk is normal. However, the desk, like an empty desk, has nothing on it.

There is an open gate leading north. There is an open portal leading west. There is an unguarded exit to the east. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

-= Study =-
You're now in the study.

You make out a closed toolbox in the corner. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a locker. You see a mantle. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's an armchair. The armchair is normal. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open portal leading east. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.
