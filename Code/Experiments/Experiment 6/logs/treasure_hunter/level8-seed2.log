Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, you could, like, make an attempt to take a trip north. And then, try to travel east. Once you accomplish that, make an attempt to venture south. And then, recover the latchkey from the floor of the workshop. Got that? Good!

-= Bar =-
You've entered a bar.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.

-= Kitchen =-
Well, here we are in the kitchen.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

go east

-= Bedchamber =-
You arrive in a bedchamber. An ordinary kind of place. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

-= Workshop =-
You've just sauntered into a workshop.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the north.

There is a gummy bear and a latchkey on the floor.
