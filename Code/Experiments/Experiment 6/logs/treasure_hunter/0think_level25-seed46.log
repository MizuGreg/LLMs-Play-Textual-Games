Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! First stop, travel north. Then, move west. And then, go south. Once you manage that, take a trip south. Once you manage that, venture west. And then, travel west. That done, try to move north. Okay, and then, venture east. If you can accomplish that, try to go to the north. After that, make an effort to move west. And then, recover the key from the floor of the cubicle. Alright, thanks!

-= Parlor =-
You're now in a parlor.

You can see a recliner. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a recliner, go to TextWorld. The recliner is standard. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You make out a bed stand. But the thing is empty. Sometimes, just sometimes, TextWorld can just be the worst. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a desk. The desk is standard. However, the desk, like an empty desk, has nothing on it.

You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

-= Vault =-
You've entered a vault.

You make out a closed crate. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a shelf. The shelf is normal. The shelf appears to be empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the shelf. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stand. But the thing is empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stand. You make out a counter. The counter is usual. The counter appears to be empty. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.
