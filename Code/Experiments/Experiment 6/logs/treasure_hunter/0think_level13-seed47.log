Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First, it would be a great idea if you could doublecheck that the passageway is opened. After that, make an effort to head south. Then, make an attempt to move east. Then, lift the key from the floor of the closet. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Cubicle =-
Look around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a cubicle. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.



There is a closed passageway leading south. There is an open gate leading east.

-= Washroom =-
You find yourself in a washroom. A normal kind of place. Let's see what's in here.

You can make out a rack. The rack is ordinary. The rack appears to be empty. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is an open passageway leading north. There is an unguarded exit to the east.



>                                                                                                                                -= Washroom =-0/5

-= Closet =-
You're now in the closet. You can barely contain your excitement.

Were you looking for a stand? Because look over there, it's a stand. The stand is standard. On the stand you can make out an insect. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it.

There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

There is a key on the floor.
