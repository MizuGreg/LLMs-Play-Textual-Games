Welcome to TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First, it would be a great idea if you could make an effort to head east. Then, attempt to head north. After that, try to head west. With that over with, lift the passkey from the floor of the bar. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Laundromat =-
You find yourself in a laundromat. An ordinary kind of place.



There is an unguarded exit to the east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user has been moving through different locations in the text-based game. The goal mentioned earlier was to head east, then north, then west, lift the passkey from the bar's floor, and then stop.

So far, the user went east from the laundromat to the canteen, then north to the closet, then west to the bar. Now they're in the bar. The current prompt says there's an unblocked exit to the east and a passkey on the floor. The instruction says to lift the passkey from the floor of the bar. 

The user's next action should be to pick up the passkey. The command for that would be "take passkey" or "get passkey". But looking at the previous commands, the user has been using "go [direction]" commands. However, in text adventures, sometimes you need to use "take" or "get" to pick up items. But the user's previous actions were all "go" commands. Maybe the game expects "take passkey" here. But the user's previous responses were only "go east", "go north", "go west". Maybe the game allows "take" as a valid command here. 

Alternatively, maybe the passkey is already in the inventory, but the user needs to pick it up. Since the passkey is on the floor, the correct action is to take it. So the next command should be "take passkey". But I need to check if the game expects that. However, the user's previous actions were all movement commands. But in the bar, the passkey is on the floor, so the correct action is to pick it up. Therefore, the next command should be "take passkey".
