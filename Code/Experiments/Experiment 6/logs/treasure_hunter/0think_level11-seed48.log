Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. Your first objective is to attempt to move south. With that over with, retrieve the keycard from the table in the study. Got that? Good!

-= Dish-Pit =-
You are in a dish-pit. A typical one. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.



There is an open gate leading north. There is an open door leading south.

-= Study =-
You are in a study. A typical one. You can barely contain your excitement.

As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a table. The table is ordinary. On the table you see a keycard. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this!

There is an open door leading north. There is an open portal leading south.

There is a pen on the floor.
