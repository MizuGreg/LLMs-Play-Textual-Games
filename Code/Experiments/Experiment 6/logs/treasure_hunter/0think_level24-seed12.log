Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to make an attempt to travel west. Then, make an attempt to take a trip south. Okay, and then, venture east. Then, try to take a trip east. If you can do that, make an attempt to move east. After that, travel south. And then, try to move south. Then, make an effort to venture west. Then, recover the desktop computer from the floor of the austere workshop. Once that's all handled, you can stop!
