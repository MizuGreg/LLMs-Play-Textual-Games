Welcome to another fast paced episode of TextWorld! First, it would be good if you could go to the north. With that done, go east. After that, make an attempt to go to the south. With that done, head east. And then, head north. If you can accomplish that, make an effort to take a trip north. Then, make an effort to move west. If you can finish that, pick up the loaf of bread from the floor of the study. Once that's all handled, you can stop!
