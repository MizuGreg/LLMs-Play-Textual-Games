Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, you could, like, go to the north. And then, try to venture east. And then, make an attempt to head north. And then, take a trip west. After that, retrieve the fondue from the floor of the dish-pit. And if you do that, you're the winner!
