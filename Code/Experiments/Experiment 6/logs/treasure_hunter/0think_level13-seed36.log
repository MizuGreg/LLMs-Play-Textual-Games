Welcome to another exciting game of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First off, go west. And then, take a trip south. And then, attempt to travel east. Okay, and then, pick-up the sandwich from the floor of the workshop. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Kitchen =-
You've just walked into a kitchen. You begin looking for stuff.



There is an open hatch leading north. There is an unguarded exit to the south. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

>                                                                                                                                -= Kitchen =-0/1
AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go west
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Sauna =-
You are in a sauna. A typical one.



There is an unblocked exit to the east. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.



>                                                                                                                                -= Sauna =-0/2
AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go south
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Spare Room =-
You find yourself in a spare room. A normal kind of place. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."

Oh, great. Here's a rack. The rack is standard. However, the rack, like an empty rack, has nothing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the rack.

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked.



>                                                                                                                                -= Spare Room =-0/3
AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go east

-= Workshop =-
You've seen better workshops, but at least this one seems pretty normal.

You see a bureau. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things.

You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

There is a sandwich on the floor.

AGENT -------------------------------------------------
