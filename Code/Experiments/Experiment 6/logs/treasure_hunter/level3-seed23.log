I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is how to play! First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to take a trip west. Then, pick-up the shadfly from the floor of the bedroom. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Cookery =-
You arrive in a cookery. A typical one. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.



There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

-= Bedroom =-
Well, here we are in the bedroom.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

There is a shadfly and a monitor on the floor.
