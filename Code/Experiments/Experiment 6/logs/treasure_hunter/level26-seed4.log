Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an exciting round of TextWorld? You do! Here is how to play! First step, go to the north. After that, go north. And then, venture east. And then, take a trip north. If you can manage that, make an effort to head west. Then, make an attempt to venture north. Then, venture east. With that accomplished, take a trip east. Next, travel south. If you can finish that, venture south. Following that, go east. After that, retrieve the frisbee from the floor of the closet. Got that? Good!

-= Laundry Place =-
You are in a laundry place. An ordinary kind of place.

You can make out a drawer. The drawer is empty! What a waste of a day! You scan the room for a table, and you find a table! The table is typical. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table.

There is an open passageway leading north. There is an unblocked exit to the east.

-= Salon =-
You arrive in a salon. A standard one.

Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a portmanteau. A closed dresser, which looks typical, is right there by you. You can make out a desk. The desk appears to be empty. Hm. Oh well

There is an open hatch leading north. There is an open passageway leading south.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game and has followed a specific path. The initial instructions were to go north, then north again, then east, and so on. The current location is the Salon, and the user has to decide the next action.

First, I need to track the user's progress. The original path mentioned going north, then north again, then east, take a trip north, west, north, east, east, south, south, east, and finally retrieve the frisbee from the closet. 

In the current scene, the user is in the Salon. The available exits are north and south. The previous steps included moving north twice, then east, etc. The user's next action should follow the sequence. 

Looking at the original steps: After arriving in the Salon, the next step in the original plan was to go north again (since the user was told to "take a trip north" after venturing east). But wait, the user's current location is the Salon, and the next step in the original instructions was after going east, then north, west, etc. Let me check the original steps again.

Original steps: After the initial north, north, east, then take a trip north. Then make an effort to head west. Then attempt to venture north. Then east, then east, south, south, east, retrieve frisbee.

Wait, the user is in the Salon. The Salon has a hatch north and a passageway south. The next step in the original plan after arriving in the Salon would be to go north again (as per the original instruction: "take a trip north" after venturing east). But the user's current position is the Salon, so perhaps the next step is to go north again. However, the user's previous action was going north from the Laundry Place to the Salon. Then, the next step in the original plan was to go north again. But in the Salon, the north is a hatch. So the user should go north again. But the user's next action would be "go north" again. However, the user might have to check if that's the correct next step. Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go south after the Salon? Wait, the original steps after arriving in the Salon: the user was told to "take a trip north" after venturing east. Wait, the original steps were: go north, then north, then east, then north, then west, then north, then east, then east, then south, then south, then east, then retrieve frisbee.

So after arriving in the Salon, the next step would be to go north again (the fourth step in the original plan). So the next action should be "go north". But the user is at the Salon, which has a hatch north. So the correct next action is "go north".
</think>go north

-= Cubicle =-
You've entered a cubicle. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."



There is an open hatch leading south. There is an unblocked exit to the east. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north.

There is a passkey on the floor.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text adventure game, and they've followed a specific path. Let me recap the steps they've taken so far.

Starting in the Laundry Place, they went north to the Salon. Then from the Salon, they went north again to the Cubicle. Now, in the Cubicle, there's a passkey on the floor. The original goal was to retrieve the frisbee from the closet. The user's path so far has them moving north, south, east, etc., but they haven't found the closet yet.

In the Cubicle, the hints mention an open hatch south, an unblocked exit east, and a passkey. The passkey might be important for opening something. The user's previous actions were moving north, but maybe they need to collect the passkey to proceed further. The next step could be picking up the passkey, which might be necessary to open the hatch or access another area leading to the closet. Alternatively, going east might be the next move, but the passkey is on the floor, so picking it up first could be crucial. The user needs to check if the passkey is required to proceed further, maybe to unlock the closet or a door. So the next action should be to pick up the passkey.
</think>pick up passkey
