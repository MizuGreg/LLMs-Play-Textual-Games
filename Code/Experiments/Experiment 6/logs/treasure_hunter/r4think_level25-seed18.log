Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, you could, like, ensure that the oak door is open. After that, attempt to go north. With that accomplished, make an effort to go to the west. Following that, lift the fresh laundry scented key from the floor of the shower. After you have picked up the fresh laundry scented key, doublecheck that the fresh laundry scented door inside the shower is unlocked. And then, ensure that the fresh laundry scented door inside the shower is open. And then, take a trip north. Then, make an effort to go to the east. Okay, and then, open the portal within the studio. After you have opened the portal, head north. Then, pick-up the latchkey from the floor of the cubicle. Alright, thanks!

-= Closet =-
You are in a closet. A normal kind of place.



There is a closed oak door leading north. There is an open wooden gateway leading west.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text adventure game. They've been following a series of steps to open doors and collect items. Let me recap the current state to make sure I understand where they are.

Starting in the Closet, they first opened the oak door north, then went north into the Serious Studio. Now, in the Serious Studio, there's a stand with nothing on it. The doors here are south (back to the closet) and west. The user's next step was to go west, but they might need to check if there's anything else to do here.

Looking back at the original instructions, after entering the studio, they were supposed to open the portal within the studio. But the current description doesn't mention a portal. Wait, maybe the portal is part of the studio's features. The user might need to look for it. Alternatively, maybe the stand is a clue. Since the stand is empty, perhaps there's an item hidden there or a trick to interact with it.

But the user's next action should be based on the current room's description. The studio has an open wooden door west. The original plan was to go west after entering the studio. But the user's previous action was going north again, which might not be correct. Wait, the user was in the studio, and the next step was to open the portal. However, the current room description doesn't mention a portal. Maybe the portal is in the west direction? Or perhaps the stand is where the portal is located. Since the stand is empty, maybe the user needs to check it again or interact with it in a different way.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check the west door. The original plan was to go west after entering the studio. But the user's last action was going north again, which might not be correct. Wait, the user was in the studio, and the next step was to open the portal. But the current room doesn't mention a portal. Maybe the portal is in the west direction. The user should check that. So the next action would be to go west. But the user might need to open the portal first. However, the instructions said to open the portal within the studio after entering. So maybe the portal is in the studio, and the user needs to find it. Since the stand is empty, maybe the portal is there. But the user hasn't interacted with the stand yet. So perhaps the next step is to check the stand, but the game might require a specific action. Alternatively, the user might need to go west to find the portal.

Wait, the original instructions said after entering the studio, open the portal within the studio. So the user is in the studio, and the next action should be to open the portal. But the current description doesn't mention a portal. Maybe the portal is in the west direction. The user needs to go west and then open the portal. But the user's last action was going north again, which might not be correct. Wait, the user was in the studio, and the next step was to go west. But the user's last action was going north again, which might be a mistake. So the correct next step would be to go west. But the user might need to check the west door first. Alternatively, the user might need to look for the portal in the studio. Since the stand is empty, maybe the portal is there, but the user hasn't interacted with it yet. So the next action should be to check the stand, but the game might require a specific command. Alternatively, the user should go west to find the portal.

Hmm, the user's next action should be to go west. The current room has a west door. So the correct next step is to go west. But the user might need to open the portal first. However, the instructions say to open the portal within the studio after entering. So maybe the portal is in the studio, and the user needs to open it. But the description doesn't mention it. Maybe the portal is in the west direction. So the user should go west first. Let me check the original steps again.

Original steps: After entering the studio, open the portal within the studio. Then head north. Then pick up the latchkey from the cubicle. So the user is in the studio, needs to open the portal. But the current room doesn't mention a portal. Maybe the portal is in the west direction. So the user should go west, then open the portal. Therefore, the next action is to go west.

You arrive in a shower. A normal kind of place. You begin looking for stuff.

As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a table. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is a closed fresh laundry scented door leading north. There is an open wooden door leading east.

There is a fresh laundry scented key on the floor.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps to open doors and collect keys. They started in the closet, opened the oak door, went north to the studio, then went west to the shower. In the shower, they picked up the fresh laundry scented key. Now, the next step according to the original instructions was to double-check that the fresh laundry scented door inside the shower is unlocked. But the door is closed, so they need to unlock it with the key they just picked up.

Wait, the current room is the shower. The door leading north is closed and fresh laundry scented. The user has the key. So the next action should be to unlock that door. But the game might require using the key on the door. So the command would be to unlock the fresh laundry scented door. But the user's previous action was picking up the key, so now they need to use it. However, the game might have specific commands. The original instruction said to double-check that the door is unlocked, so maybe the user needs to try unlocking it. So the next action is to unlock the door. But the user might need to use the key on the door. So the command would be "unlock fresh laundry scented door" or something similar. But the game's previous responses used commands like "open oak door", so maybe "unlock fresh laundry scented door" is the correct command here. Alternatively, maybe "use fresh laundry scented key on fresh laundry scented door". But the user's previous action was "pick up fresh laundry scented key", so the next step is to unlock the door with that key. So the correct command is "unlock fresh laundry scented door".

There is an open fresh laundry scented door leading south. There is an open gateway leading east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Okay, let's see. The user is navigating through different rooms in the game. They started in the closet, opened the oak door, went north to the studio, then west to the shower. They picked up the key, unlocked and opened the fresh laundry scented door, then went north again to the workshop. Now they're in the "Serious Workshop" and need to proceed.

The current room is the Serious Workshop. The description mentions a mantle with nothing on it and exits to east, north, and south. The user's previous action was going west from the salon, which led them here. The original goal was to open a portal in the studio, but they might have missed that step. Wait, earlier in the studio, they were supposed to open the portal. But in the current room, there's no mention of a portal. Maybe the portal is in the east or north direction. The user needs to check those exits. The next step would be to go east, as the instruction said to go east after entering the studio. But they were in the workshop now. Alternatively, maybe the portal is in the north or south. The user should check the available exits. The command would be to go east, north, or south. Since the original plan was to open the portal in the studio, perhaps the user needs to go back to the studio. But they are in the workshop now. Wait, the user was in the studio, then went west to the shower, then north to the workshop. So maybe the portal is in the studio's east direction. But the user hasn't checked that yet. Alternatively, the portal might be in the Serious Workshop. The user needs to explore the available exits. The next action should be to go east, as that's unblocked. So the command is "go east".

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Salon and Workshop. They've been going back and forth between these rooms without making progress towards the original goal of opening the portal in the studio. The key steps they needed to do earlier were: open the oak door, go north to the studio, open the portal, then proceed further. But they might have missed opening the portal in the studio. Alternatively, the portal could be in a different location. The current room is the Workshop, and the exits are south, east, north, and west. The user needs to find the portal, which was mentioned in the original instructions. Since they haven't opened it yet, maybe they need to check the east or north exits from the Workshop. The command should be to go east to check that direction.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, the user has opened the portal in the studio and gone north to the cubicle. The next step according to the original instructions was to pick up the latchkey from the floor of the cubicle. The current room is the cubicle, and there's a latchkey on the floor. So the correct action is to pick up the latchkey. The user needs to retrieve it to proceed further. The command should be "pick up latchkey".
