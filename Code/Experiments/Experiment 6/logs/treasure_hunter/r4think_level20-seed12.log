Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is how to play! First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to travel west. Next, travel south. That done, try to go west. After that, pick up the fly larva from the floor of the cookhouse. Alright, thanks!

-= Cubicle =-
Well, here we are in a cubicle. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.



There is an open door leading south. There is an open gateway leading west.

-= Study =-
Of every study you could have walked into, you had to come round an usual one. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You see a locked coffer. You make out a trunk. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You scan the room for a stand, and you find a stand. The stand is typical. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is a closed gate leading west. There is an open gateway leading east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

-= Vault =-
You make a grand eccentric entrance into a vault. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You see a suitcase. You make out a counter. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the counter.

You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they have to navigate through different rooms and find the fly larva in the cookhouse. The current room is the Vault, and the user has been moving between the Vault and Study rooms repeatedly.

First, I need to track the user's progress. The initial instructions said to go west, then south, then west again, and pick up the fly larva from the cookhouse. But the user's movements so far have been going back and forth between Vault and Study. The user might be stuck in a loop, not making progress towards the cookhouse.

Looking at the room descriptions, the Vault has a suitcase and a counter, but nothing on the counter. The Study has a locked coffer, a trunk, and a stand. The exits are west (closed gate) and east (open gateway), and south. The user has tried going south multiple times, which leads back to the Vault.

Wait, the original plan was to go west from the Cubicle, then south, then west again to reach the cookhouse. But the user's path seems to be going from Cubicle -> Study -> Vault -> Study -> Vault, etc. Maybe the user isn't following the correct path. The cookhouse might be in a different direction. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to find a way to open the locked coffer or the trunk in the Study room, but there's no mention of keys or tools.

The user's goal is to pick up the fly larva from the cookhouse. So the user needs to reach the cookhouse. The current path doesn't seem to be leading there. The user might be missing a key step, like opening a door or finding a way to proceed further.

In the Vault, there's an unguarded exit to the west. Maybe that's the way to go. But the user has been going north and south, not exploring west. If the user goes west from the Vault, maybe they can reach the cookhouse. Alternatively, the closed gate west in the Study might lead to another room.

But the user's previous actions have been going south and north, not exploring west. So the next logical step might be to go west from the Vault. However, the user is in the Vault, and the description says there's an unguarded exit to the west. So the user should try going west from the Vault. That might lead them to the cookhouse or another room that's part of the path to the cookhouse.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to find a way to open the locked coffer in the Study. But without a key, that's not possible. The user hasn't picked up any items yet, so maybe they need to find a key or another item. But the current rooms don't mention any keys.

Given the user's current position in the Vault, the next action should be to go west. That's the unguarded exit mentioned. So the correct command would be "go west" from the Vault. That might lead them to the cookhouse or another room that's part of the path.

-= Cookhouse =-
You're now in the cookhouse.

You can make out a locked case, which looks usual, in the room.

There is a closed portal leading north. There is an open hatch leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a fly larva on the floor.
