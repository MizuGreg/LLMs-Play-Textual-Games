Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to make an attempt to travel west. Then, make an attempt to take a trip south. Okay, and then, venture east. Then, try to take a trip east. If you can do that, make an attempt to move east. After that, travel south. And then, try to move south. Then, make an effort to venture west. Then, recover the desktop computer from the floor of the austere workshop. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Cubicle =-

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. There is an unguarded exit to the north. There is an unblocked exit to the south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in a text-based game. Their goal is to recover the desktop computer from the workshop. So far, they've moved west, south, east, and then tried to go south again but couldn't. They ended up in the Vault, where there's an exit to the east.

The current room is the Vault. The exits here are south, west, and east. The user's next move should be to check the east exit since that's the only one mentioned as unblocked. But wait, the user's previous action was going east from the Cookhouse to the Vault. Now, in the Vault, the exits are south, west, and east. The user might need to go east again to proceed further. But the original goal is to get to the workshop's floor. Maybe the desktop computer is in the workshop, which is part of the cubicle or another room. The user needs to find the right path. Since the Vault has an east exit, maybe that leads to the workshop. So the next action should be to go east from the Vault. But the user's last action was going east, so maybe they need to check other directions. Alternatively, maybe the desktop computer is in the Vault, but the description doesn't mention it. The user needs to explore the Vault's rooms. The correct next step is to go east from the Vault to continue the journey towards the workshop.
