Welcome to TextWorld! Here is your task for today. Your first objective is to try to take a trip east. And then, ensure that the gate is open. And then, go south. Following that, venture east. After that, make an attempt to take a trip north. And then, move north. Following that, attempt to move west. After that, take a trip west. Then, take the fudge scented latchkey from the shelf inside the cookery. And then, unlock the fudge scented portal within the cookery. Then, ensure that the fudge scented portal within the cookery is open. Then, head west. After that, venture south. Then, lift the stick of butter from the floor of the office. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Workshop =-
You arrive in a workshop. A normal kind of place. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."

You can make out a trunk.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Kitchenette =-
You find yourself in a kitchenette. An ordinary kind of place. You can barely contain your excitement.

You see a freezer. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You see a pan. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a pan? The pan is standard. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is a closed gate leading south. There is an open gateway leading north. There is an unguarded exit to the east. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

You find yourself in a kitchenette. An ordinary kind of place. You can barely contain your excitement.

You see a freezer. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You see a pan. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a pan? The pan is standard. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is a closed gate leading south. There is an open gateway leading north. There is an unguarded exit to the east. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

You find yourself in a kitchenette. An ordinary kind of place. You can barely contain your excitement.

You see a freezer. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You see a pan. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a pan? The pan is standard. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is a closed gate leading south. There is an open gateway leading north. There is an unguarded exit to the east. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

You find yourself in a kitchenette. An ordinary kind of place. You can barely contain your excitement.

You see a freezer. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You see a pan. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a pan? The pan is standard. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is a closed gate leading south. There is an open gateway leading north. There is an unguarded exit to the east. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.
