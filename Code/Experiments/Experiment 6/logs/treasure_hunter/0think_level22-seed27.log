Welcome to another exciting session of TextWorld! First thing I need you to do is to go south. That done, make an effort to head south. With that done, travel west. If you can manage that, make an attempt to venture north. After that, pick up the spoon from the floor of the super hot canteen. And once you've done that, you win!
