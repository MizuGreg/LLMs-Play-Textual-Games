Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an profound round of TextWorld? You do! Here is how to play! First of all, move east. Once you accomplish that, try to head east. That done, head north. Okay, and then, make an attempt to go to the west. Once you finish that, travel west. If you can get through with that, make an attempt to go west. If you can finish that, try to go west. After that, make an attempt to venture south. And then, travel east. Then, make an effort to move south. If you can do that, go south. With that over with, recover the keycard from the floor of the bar. Got that? Good!

-= Cookhouse =-
You've just walked into a cookhouse. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You see a locked chest. You can make out a closed freezer here.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

You are in a spare room. A normal kind of place. You begin looking for stuff.

You can see a locked trunk. You see a locked locker. You can make out a stand. The stand is normal. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

There is an unblocked exit to the east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.
