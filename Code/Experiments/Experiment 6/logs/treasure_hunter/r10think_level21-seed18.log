It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First of all, ensure that the portal within the studio is open. After that, attempt to travel north. Then, retrieve the latchkey from the floor of the cubicle. Alright, thanks!

-= Studio =-
You've just walked into a studio.

You can make out a closed coffer. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. The table is normal. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.

There is a closed portal leading north. There is an open gateway leading west.

This might come as a shock to you, but you've just stumbled into a cubicle. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You see a bureau.

There is an open portal leading south. There is an open passageway leading east.

There is a latchkey on the floor.
