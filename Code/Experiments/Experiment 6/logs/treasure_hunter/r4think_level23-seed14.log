Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an fast paced round of TextWorld? You do! First step, head east. Okay, and then, go north. Once you accomplish that, take a trip east. Once you finish that, try to go south. Once you accomplish that, head south. After that, make an effort to travel south. With that done, recover the mop from the floor of the laundry place. Got that? Good!

-= Laundromat =-
Ah, the laundromat. This is some kind of laundromat, really great normal vibes in this place, a wonderful normal atmosphere. And now, well, you're in it.

You make out a table. The table is ordinary. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game and has been moving through different rooms: Laundromat, Bedroom, Cookery, back to Bedroom again. The original goal was to recover the mop from the laundry place, which is the Laundromat.

So far, the user has gone east from Laundromat to Cookery, then west back to Bedroom. Now they're back in the Bedroom. The chest is mentioned here. The original goal was to get the mop from the laundry place, which is the Laundromat. But the user is now in the Bedroom again. Maybe the mop is in the Laundromat, but they need to find it. However, the path back to Laundromat might involve going west from the Bedroom through the portal. Wait, in the Bedroom description, there's an open portal leading west. So maybe going west from Bedroom would take them back to Laundromat. But the user is currently in the Bedroom, so the next step would be to go west to return to Laundromat and then find the mop. But the user's previous steps were moving around, and they might have already passed the Laundromat. Wait, the initial steps were: go east (from Laundromat to Cookery), then west back to Bedroom. Now they're back in Bedroom. So to get back to Laundromat, they need to go west again. But the user is asking if they're close to the goal. Since the mop is in the Laundromat, they need to go back there. So the next action should be to go west from Bedroom to Laundromat, then check the floor for the mop. But the user's last action was going west to Bedroom, so the next step would be to go west again from Bedroom to Laundromat. But the user is asking if they're close. Since they're in Bedroom, they need to go back to Laundromat. So the next command should be go west.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to recover the mop from the laundry place, which is the Laundromat. So far, they've gone through several rooms: Laundromat, Bedroom, Cookery, back to Bedroom, then Laundromat again, then to the Cellar, and now they're in the Office.

The original goal was to get the mop from the laundry place. The user is now in the Office. The previous steps included going west from the Cellar to the Office. The Office has an exit to the north and east. The user needs to find the mop, which was in the Laundromat. But maybe the path back to the Laundromat is through the Office. Wait, the Office's description says there's an exit to the north and east. If the user is in the Office, going north might take them back to the Cellar, but the Laundromat is west of the Cellar.

Okay, let's recap. The user's goal is to recover the mop from the laundry place, which is the Laundromat. They've been moving through various rooms: Laundromat, Bedroom, Cookery, Cellar, Office, Shower, and back to Office.

Currently, they're in the Office again. The previous steps involved going north from the Shower back to the Office. The Office has exits to the north and east. The user needs to get back to the Laundromat to find the mop. The path from the Office to the Laundromat would likely involve going west through the Cellar and then west again to the Laundromat. But the Office's exits are north and east. Wait, maybe the user needs to go east from the Office to reach another area that connects back to the Laundromat. Alternatively, maybe the Office is part of a loop, and the user needs to find the correct path. Since the user is in the Office, the next logical step would be to go east, as the Office's description suggests trying east. But the user has been moving back and forth, so perhaps they need to find the correct path back to the Laundromat. However, the user is asking if they're close to the goal. Since they've been circling, maybe they need to go back through the Cellar and then west to the Laundromat. But from the Office, the exits are north and east. So the next action should be to go east to proceed further.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to get the mop from the laundromat. They've been moving through various rooms: Laundromat, Bedroom, Cookery, Cellar, Office, Shower, back to Office, Cellar again. Now they're in the Cellar again.

The key is to find the mop in the Laundromat. The user has been going back and forth between the Cellar and Office. The Cellar has a secret button that reveals a counter, but it's empty. The exits are north, south, and west. The Laundromat is west of the Cellar. So maybe the user needs to go west from the Cellar to get back to the Laundromat. But the user is already in the Cellar, and the previous action was going west, which led them back to the Office. Wait, no, the Cellar's west exit is unblocked. So going west from the Cellar would take them to the Office? Or maybe the Laundromat? Wait, the Laundromat is connected to the Bedroom, which is connected to the Cookery, etc. Maybe the user needs to find the correct path back to the Laundromat. Since the user is in the Cellar, going west might not be the right direction. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go north from the Cellar to get back to the Office, then east to the Shower, then south to the Office again, and then find another way. But the user's goal is to get the mop from the Laundromat. Since the mop is in the Laundromat, the user needs to get back there. The last time they were in the Laundromat, they didn't find the mop. Maybe they need to check the Laundromat again. But how to get back? The Cellar's west exit is unblocked, but that leads to the Office. Maybe the user needs to go north from the Cellar to the Office, then east to the Shower, then south to the Office, then east again? This seems confusing. Alternatively, maybe the user should go south from the Cellar to get back to the Laundromat. Wait, the Cellar has a hatch leading south. If the user goes south from the Cellar, they might reach the Laundromat. Let me check the previous descriptions. In the Laundromat, there's a passageway leading west. The Cellar's south exit would be the next step. So the user should go south from the Cellar to get back to the Laundromat. Then check the floor for the mop. So the next action is go south.

If they go south from Pantry, maybe that leads to the Laundromat. But earlier, the Laundromat was connected to the Bedroom, which is connected to Cookery. Alternatively, maybe the Pantry's west exit is a cedar portal leading back to the Cookhouse. But the user needs to get to the Laundromat.

Ah, the cellar. This is some kind of cellar, really great ordinary vibes in this place, a wonderful ordinary atmosphere. The room is well lit.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

There is an open gate leading north. There is an open hatch leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

Okay, the user is trying to get the mop from the laundromat. They've been moving through various rooms, looping between the Cellar, Office, Shower, and Pantry. The key is to get back to the Laundromat. The user is in the Cellar now. The exits are north, south, and west. The Laundromat is west of the Cellar. So the next step should be to go west from the Cellar to reach the Laundromat. That way, they can check the floor for the mop. The previous steps showed that going west from the Cellar leads to the Office, but maybe that's part of the loop. However, the Laundromat is connected to the Bedroom, which is connected to the Cookery. But the user needs to get back to the Laundromat. So the correct action is to go west from the Cellar.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Office, Shower, and Cellar. They need to get back to the Laundromat to find the mop. The previous attempts to go west from the Cellar led back to the Office. Maybe the correct path is to go south from the Shower to get back to the Office, then east to the Cellar, then west to the Laundromat. But the user is in the Office again. The exit to the east is unguarded. So the next step should be to go east from the Office to the Cellar, then west to the Laundromat. But the user is asking if they're close. Since they've been going in circles, maybe they need to try a different approach. The next action should be to go east from the Office to the Cellar.

Ah, the cellar. This is some kind of cellar, really great ordinary vibes in this place, a wonderful ordinary atmosphere. The room is well lit.

There is an open gate leading north. There is an open hatch leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.
