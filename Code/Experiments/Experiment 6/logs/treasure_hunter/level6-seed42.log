You are now playing a fast paced session of TextWorld! First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to make an effort to take a trip south. With that done, attempt to take a trip east. And then, recover the stick of butter from the floor of the restroom. Alright, thanks!

-= Kitchen =-
Okay, so you're in a kitchen, cool, but is it normal? You better believe it is.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

There is a bug on the floor.
