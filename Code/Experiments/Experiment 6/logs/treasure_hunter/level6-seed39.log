You are now playing a fast paced session of TextWorld! First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to attempt to travel east. With that accomplished, take a trip east. That done, lift the candy bar from the floor of the cubicle. Alright, thanks!

-= Restroom =-
You find yourself in a restroom. A normal kind of place.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the north.

AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go east
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Bedchamber =-
You are in a bedchamber. An ordinary one.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

-= Cubicle =-
You make a grand eccentric entrance into a cubicle.



There is an unblocked exit to the west.

There is a candy bar and a Quote of the Day Calendar on the floor.

That's not a verb I recognise.
