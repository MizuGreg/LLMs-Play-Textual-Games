I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! First of all, you could, like, try to take a trip west. And then, make an attempt to take a trip north. And then, go to the west. With that accomplished, make an effort to venture south. And then, recover the licorice strip from the board within the washroom. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Study =-
You've just sauntered into a study.

You can see an opened portmanteau in the room. The portmanteau is empty! What a waste of a day!

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

-= Bedroom =-
You've just walked into a bedroom.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

-= Washroom =-
Fancy seeing you here. Here, by the way, being the washroom. You can barely contain your excitement.

You can see a rack. However, the rack, like an empty rack, has nothing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a board. On the board you can make out a licorice strip.
