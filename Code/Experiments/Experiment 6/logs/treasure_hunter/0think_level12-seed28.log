Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! First, it would be a great idea if you could try to go to the north. And then, try to go west. After that, pick-up the passkey from the floor of the laundromat. That's it!

-= Workshop =-
You arrive in a workshop. An usual kind of place. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

Look over there! a desk. The desk is ordinary. But the thing is empty.

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

There is a latchkey on the floor.

-= Bedroom =-
You arrive in a bedroom. A typical kind of place. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You make out a portmanteau. The portmanteau is empty, what a horrible day! You can make out a closed trunk right there by you. You scan the room, seeing a bookshelf. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The bookshelf is typical. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well

You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.
