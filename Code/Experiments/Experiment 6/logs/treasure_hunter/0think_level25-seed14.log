Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to travel south. With that done, head south. After that, make an effort to travel east. With that done, venture north. If you can accomplish that, venture east. With that accomplished, head north. Okay, and then, make an effort to take a trip east. And then, make an effort to venture south. Okay, and then, try to travel south. With that over with, take a trip south. Once you do that, pick-up the mop from the floor of the laundry place. And once you"ve done that, you win!

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

There is an open gate leading north. There is an open hatch leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

You are in an office. A normal one.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded.
