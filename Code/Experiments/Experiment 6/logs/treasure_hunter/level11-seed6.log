Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First thing I need you to do is to head west. After that, recover the chocolate bar from the floor of the workshop. Alright, thanks!

-= Kitchenette =-
You've just walked into a kitchenette.

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a cabinet. You can make out a saucepan. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

You are in a workshop. A standard kind of place. You begin looking for stuff.



There is an unguarded exit to the east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

There is a chocolate bar and a broccoli on the floor.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is in a text-based game where they need to find a chocolate bar and get to a certain location. The current setup seems to be between the Workshop and the Basement, with the chocolate bar in the Workshop.

The user has been moving back and forth between the Workshop and Basement, going south and north repeatedly. The goal is to recover the chocolate bar from the floor of the workshop. The user is currently in the Workshop again, and the chocolate bar is there. But the user hasn't picked it up yet. 

Looking at the previous moves, the user kept going south to the basement and then back to the workshop. The problem might be that the user is stuck in a loop, not taking the action to pick up the chocolate bar. The game's description mentions that the chocolate bar is on the floor, so the next logical step is to pick it up.

But the user's last action was "go south" again, which takes them back to the basement. However, the chocolate is in the workshop. So the correct action should be to pick up the chocolate bar instead of moving again. But the game's commands might require the user to first be in the workshop to pick it up. Since the user is in the workshop, they should pick up the chocolate bar. However, the game's interface might not allow that unless the user is in the correct location.

Wait, the user is in the Workshop, and the chocolate is there. So the next action should be to take the chocolate bar. But the user's previous actions were just moving, so maybe they haven't noticed the chocolate yet. But the game's description says "There is a chocolate bar and a broccoli on the floor," so the user should be able to pick it up. However, the user hasn't done that yet. So the correct action is to pick up the chocolate bar. But the user's previous moves were just moving, so maybe the user is not aware that they can pick it up. Therefore, the next action should be to take the chocolate bar.
