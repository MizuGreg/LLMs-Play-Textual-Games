Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First thing I need you to do is to head west. After that, recover the chocolate bar from the floor of the workshop. Alright, thanks!

-= Kitchenette =-
You've just walked into a kitchenette.

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a cabinet. You can make out a saucepan. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

-= Workshop =-
You are in a workshop. A standard kind of place. You begin looking for stuff.



There is an unguarded exit to the east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

There is a chocolate bar and a broccoli on the floor.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they need to recover a chocolate bar from the workshop. The current location is the Workshop, and there's a chocolate bar on the floor. The user just moved west from the Kitchenette to the Workshop. Now, the prompt says there's a chocolate bar and broccoli on the floor. The goal is to recover the chocolate bar.

The user's previous action was "go west", which took them to the Workshop. Now, the next step is to pick up the chocolate bar. Since the chocolate bar is on the floor, the correct action would be to pick it up. The game's environment indicates that the chocolate is there, so the next command should be "take chocolate" or "pick up chocolate". The user needs to collect it to fulfill the task. The exit directions are mentioned, but the main objective is to get the chocolate. So the immediate action is to take the chocolate bar.
