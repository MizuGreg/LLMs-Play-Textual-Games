Welcome to TextWorld! Here is how to play! First of all, you could, like, make an effort to travel south. That done, lift the peanut from the floor of the studio. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Office =-
You arrive in an office. A standard one.

You see a cabinet. The cabinet is empty, what a horrible day!

There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

-= Studio =-
You arrive in a studio. A standard one.



There is an open door leading east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked.

There is a peanut on the floor.

That's not a verb I recognise.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game called TextWorld. The goal seems to be to reach the original goal, which might be something like escaping or completing a task. Let me look at the current situation.

The user is in the Studio. There's an open door leading east, and they can go north since that entranceway is unblocked. There's also a peanut on the floor. The previous actions were "go south" and "lift the peanut". But the game said "That's not a verb I recognise" when the user tried to lift the peanut. Wait, maybe the correct action is different. Let me check the game's possible commands.

In TextWorld, the valid actions are usually things like "go north", "take item", "use item", etc. The user tried "lift the peanut", but maybe the correct verb is "take" or "pick up". However, the game's response indicated that "lift" wasn't recognized. So perhaps the correct action is "take the peanut" or "pick up the peanut".

But the user's next action was supposed to be the command only. The user is asking if they're on the right track and what their next action should be. The previous action was "lift the peanut", which was invalid. So the correct action here would be to take the peanut. But the game might have specific verbs. Let me check the game's possible commands again.

Looking at the previous messages, the user was told to "lift the peanut from the floor of the studio". But the game didn't recognize "lift". Maybe the correct verb is "take" or "get". However, in some games, "lift" is acceptable. But since the game said it's not recognized, the user must use the correct verb.

Alternatively, maybe the peanut is already on the floor, and the user needs to pick it up. The correct command might be "take peanut" or "pick up peanut". But the game might require the article, like "take the peanut".

Wait, in the initial instruction, the user was told to "lift the peanut from the floor of the studio". So maybe the correct command is "lift the peanut". But the game said that wasn't recognized. Maybe the game uses "take" instead. So the user should try "take the peanut".

But the user's last action was "lift the peanut", which was invalid. Now, the user is asking if they're close to the goal. The original goal was to "stop" after handling the peanut. So maybe after taking the peanut, the next step is to go east or north.

But the user's next action should be the correct command. Since "lift" didn't work, maybe "take the peanut" is the correct verb. So the next action would be "take the peanut".

Alternatively, maybe the game expects "get the peanut". But I need to check the possible commands. Since the user is in the Studio, and there's a peanut on the floor, the correct action is to take it. So the next command should be "take the peanut".
