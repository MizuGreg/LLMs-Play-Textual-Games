Welcome to TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, you could, like, make an attempt to take a trip west. After that, move west. With that done, attempt to go to the north. And then, make an attempt to take a trip east. Once you accomplish that, lift the book from the floor of the study. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Shower =-
You find yourself in a shower. A standard one. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.
