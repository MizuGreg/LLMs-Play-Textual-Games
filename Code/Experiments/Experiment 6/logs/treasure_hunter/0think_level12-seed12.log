Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is how to play! First off, make an effort to take a trip south. And then, go to the west. After that, retrieve the fly larva from the floor of the cookhouse. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Study =-
Of every study you could have walked into, you had to come round an usual one. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You see a locked coffer. You make out a trunk. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You scan the room for a stand, and you find a stand. The stand is typical. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is an open gateway leading east. There is an open gate leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

-= Vault =-
You make a grand eccentric entrance into a vault. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You see a suitcase. You make out a counter. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the counter.

You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

-= Study =-
Of every study you could have walked into, you had to come round an usual one. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You see a locked coffer. You make out a trunk. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You scan the room for a stand, and you find a stand. The stand is typical. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is an open gateway leading east. There is an open gate leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

You make a grand eccentric entrance into a vault. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You see a suitcase. You make out a counter. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the counter.

You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

-= Study =-
Of every study you could have walked into, you had to come round an usual one. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You see a locked coffer. You make out a trunk. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You scan the room for a stand, and you find a stand. The stand is typical. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is an open gateway leading east. There is an open gate leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the west.
