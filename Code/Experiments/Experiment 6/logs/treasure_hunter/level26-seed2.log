Welcome to another exciting episode of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First thing I need you to do is to try to go east. And then, make an effort to go south. Once you do that, try to go to the west. Then, make an effort to go to the south. With that over with, make an effort to travel west. And then, take a trip south. Following that, attempt to take a trip west. After that, attempt to go south. Once you get through with that, attempt to go to the east. And then, go to the east. With that accomplished, venture north. That done, pick-up the passkey from the floor of the spare room. That's it!

-= Parlor =-
You've entered a parlor.

You can see a stand. The stand is ordinary. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

There is an unblocked exit to the east.

GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Shower =-
You find yourself in a shower. An ordinary one.

You make out a locked safe close by. You make out a rack. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open passageway leading south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game and has already gone east from the parlor into the shower. The current location is the shower, which has a locked safe, a rack (which is empty), an open passageway south, and an exit west.

The original goal mentioned in the welcome message was to pick up the passkey from the floor of the spare room. So far, the player has moved east twice (from parlor to shower), then maybe south or west? Wait, the user's actions so far were "go east" once, leading to the shower. Then the next step would be to follow the instructions given in the welcome message.

The welcome message said: after going east, then make an effort to go south. So from the shower, the player should go south. The current location (shower) has an open passageway leading south. So the next action should be to go south. That would take them to the next room, maybe the spare room where the passkey is located.

But wait, the user's previous action was "go east" once, leading to the shower. The next step according to the instructions is to go south. So the correct next command is "go south". Then, after that, the instructions say to go west, then south again, etc. But the user's current location is the shower, so the immediate next step is to go south. The user is asking if they're on the right track, so the assistant should confirm that going south is the next correct move.

GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Sauna =-
You find yourself in a sauna.



There is an open passageway leading north. There is an open portal leading west.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text adventure game, and they've been moving through different rooms: Parlor, Shower, Sauna. The original goal was to pick up the passkey from the spare room. So far, they went east from Parlor to Shower, then south to Sauna. Now, in the Sauna, there's a north and west exit.

The user is asking if they're on the right track and if they're close to the goal. The previous steps involved moving east, south, west, south, west, south, east, north. But in the current Sauna room, the exits are north and west. The passkey is in the spare room, which I assume is a specific room that's part of the map. 

The user's next action would depend on the path to the spare room. Since they've been moving south and west, maybe the spare room is in a different direction. But in the Sauna, the options are north or west. If they go west from Sauna, maybe they can find the spare room. Alternatively, going north might lead them back towards the Parlor or Shower. 

But the original instructions mentioned going west, south, etc., so perhaps the correct path is to continue west from Sauna. Let me check the previous steps again. The user had to go east, south, west, south, west, south, east, north. So after Sauna, maybe the next step is west again. But in the Sauna, the west exit is available. So the next action should be west. That would take them to the next room, maybe the spare room or another area. Let me confirm: the user needs to pick up the passkey from the spare room. So if the spare room is accessible via west from Sauna, then go west. Otherwise, maybe north. But the user's previous steps suggest that they need to navigate through the correct path. Since the user is asking if they're close, maybe they are, and the next step is west. So the answer is go west.
</think>go west

-= Laundromat =-
You've just shown up in a laundromat.



There is an open portal leading east. There is an open gate leading south.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game where they have to navigate through different rooms and eventually pick up the passkey from the spare room. The original instructions mentioned a specific sequence of directions: go east, then south, west, south, west, south, east, east, then north to get the passkey.

So far, the user has gone from the Parlor to the Shower (east), then to the Sauna (south), then to the Laundromat (west). The next step in the sequence after Laundromat would be south, as per the instructions. The Laundromat has an open gate leading south, so the next logical move is to go south. The user is probably following the path correctly, moving through each room as instructed. Since the goal is to reach the spare room and pick up the passkey, moving south from the Laundromat makes sense. The user is on track, so the next action should be "go south".

GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Bar =-
You arrive in a bar. A standard one.

You can make out a recliner. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.

There is an open gate leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.



>                                                                                                                                -= Bar =-0/5

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user has been following a sequence of directions: go east, then south, west, south, west, south, east, east, north, and then pick up the passkey. So far, they've gone through the parlor, shower, sauna, laundromat, and bar. The current location is the bar.

In the bar description, there's a recliner but nothing on it. The exits are north, east, south, and west. The user's previous actions have been moving south, west, etc., following the initial instructions. The goal was to pick up the passkey from the spare room's floor. 

But the current location is the bar. The user hasn't mentioned finding the passkey yet. The initial instructions said after going through several directions, venture north, then pick up the passkey. So maybe after the bar, the next step is to go north. But the user's last action was going south from the laundromat to the bar. Now, in the bar, the possible exits are north, east, south, west. The user needs to go north as per the original plan. However, the user's last action was going south, so maybe the next step is to go north from the bar. But the user's previous actions have been moving south, west, etc. Wait, the original instructions said after going through all those directions, go north, then pick up the passkey. So maybe after the bar, going north would lead to the next area. But the user hasn't reached the spare room yet. The passkey is in the spare room's floor. So maybe the path requires moving through different areas until reaching the spare room. The user is currently in the bar. The next step would be to go north from the bar, as per the original plan. But the user's last action was going south, so maybe the next action is to go north. However, the user's previous steps have been following the initial directions, so the next step is to go north from the bar. But the user's last action was going south, so perhaps the next step is to go north. The user's next action should be "go north" to proceed towards the spare room. But I need to check the current location's exits. The bar has an open gate leading north. So the correct next action is to go north.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game where they have to navigate through different rooms and eventually pick up the passkey from the spare room. The initial instructions mentioned a specific sequence of directions: go east, south, west, south, west, south, east, east, then north, and finally pick up the passkey.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Laundromat again. The previous moves were: from the Bar, they went north back to the Laundromat. Now, the Laundromat has an open portal east and an open gate south. The next step in the original plan was to go west, then south, but since they're back in the Laundromat, maybe they need to go east again? Wait, the user's previous action was going north from the Bar to the Laundromat. The next step in the sequence was to go west, but the Laundromat's west is blocked? Wait, no, the Laundromat's description says there's an open portal east and an open gate south. So maybe the next move should be east? But the original plan had after Laundromat, go south. Wait, the original steps were: after the Bar, go north (which took them back to Laundromat), then the next step was to go west? But in the Laundromat, the west is not mentioned as open. Wait, the Laundromat's description says there's an open portal east and an open gate south. So maybe the user is supposed to go east from here? But the original plan had after the Bar, go north (which they did), then the next step was to go west? Hmm, maybe I need to retrace the steps.

Original instructions: After the Bar, the user was supposed to go north (which they did, back to Laundromat). Then, the next step was to go west, but in the Laundromat, the west is not listed as open. Wait, the Laundromat's description says there's an open portal east and an open gate south. So maybe the user is supposed to go south from here? But the original plan had after Laundromat, go south. Wait, the original sequence was: after the Bar, go north (to Laundromat), then go west, then south, then west, then south, etc. But in the Laundromat, the west is not open. So maybe the user is supposed to go east from the Laundromat? But that's not part of the original plan. Wait, maybe the user is getting confused. Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go south from the Laundromat, which is open. But the original plan had after the Bar, go north (to Laundromat), then go west, but that's not possible. So perhaps the user is supposed to go east from the Laundromat? But the original plan didn't mention that. Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go south from the Laundromat. But the original plan had after the Bar, go north, then west, then south, etc. Maybe the user is getting stuck here. But according to the current room, the Laundromat has east and south open. So the next step should be to go south, which would take them to the next room. But the original plan had after the Bar, go north, then west, but that's not possible. So perhaps the user is supposed to go east from the Laundromat. But the original plan didn't mention that. Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go south from the Laundromat.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game where they have to navigate through different rooms and eventually pick up the passkey from the spare room. The original instructions mentioned a specific sequence of directions: go east, south, west, south, west, south, east, east, then north to get the passkey.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Bar room ( -= Bar =- ) again, which is part of the loop they've been going through. The previous steps have them moving back and forth between the Laundromat and Bar. The count is at 0/7, so they've probably been stuck in a cycle.

The next logical step would be to follow the initial instructions. After reaching the Bar, the next step in the original plan was to go north, which they did, leading back to the Laundromat. Then they went south again, back to the Bar. It seems like they're oscillating between these two rooms. 

Since the original plan says after going south from the Bar, they should go east, but the Bar's description mentions an unblocked exit to the east. However, the user has been going north and south, which might not be the right path. Alternatively, maybe they need to explore other directions. But according to the initial instructions, after the initial movements, they need to go north to the spare room. However, the current position is the Bar, so perhaps they need to find another way out.

Wait, the original goal was to pick up the passkey from the spare room. The user hasn't found the spare room yet. The initial steps were to move east, south, west, south, west, south, east, east, then north. So maybe after getting to the Bar, they need to go east. The Bar's description says there's an unblocked exit to the east. So maybe the next step is to go east from the Bar. That would take them to the Laundromat again, but perhaps from there they can proceed further. Alternatively, maybe the east direction from the Bar leads to another room that's part of the path to the spare room.

But the user's current count is 0/7, which suggests they might be repeating steps. However, the game might have a specific path. Let me check the previous steps again. The user started at the Parlor, went east to the Shower, then south to the Sauna, west to the Laundromat, south to the Bar, north back to Laundromat, south to Bar again. So they're stuck in a loop between Laundromat and Bar. The original plan says after going south from the Bar, they should go east. But the Bar's description says east is unblocked. So maybe the next step is to go east from the Bar. That would take them back to the Laundromat, but perhaps from there they can proceed south again. However, the Laundromat has an open gate leading south, which would take them back to the Bar. It seems like a loop. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to find another way out. But according to the initial instructions, the correct path is to go east, south, west, south, west, south, east, east, north. So after the initial movements, they should be heading north to the spare room. But the current position is the Bar. Maybe they need to go east from the Bar to get to the Laundromat, then south to the Bar again, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go west from the Bar, which is unblocked. The Bar's description says there's an exit to the west. So perhaps the next step is to go west from the Bar, which would take them back to the Laundromat. But that's the same as before. 

Wait, maybe the user is supposed to go east from the Bar. The Bar's description says: "You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south. There is an exit to the west." So the east is unblocked. So maybe the next step is to go east. That would take them to the Laundromat again. Then from there, go south to the Bar again. It's a loop. But according to the original instructions, after going south from the Bar, they should go east, then west, etc. Maybe the user needs to continue following the initial directions even if it loops. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go north from the Bar, which is the next step in the original plan. But the user already did that, leading back to the Laundromat. So perhaps the correct next step is to go east from the Bar, even though it loops. The user needs to follow the instructions regardless of the current position. So the next action would be to go east.

You are in a cubicle. A typical kind of place. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

Oh, great. Here's a bookshelf. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

The original instructions mentioned a specific sequence of directions: go east, south, west, south, west, south, east, east, north, and then collect the passkey.

So far, the user has been moving through rooms like the Parlor, Shower, Sauna, Laundromat, Bar, and now the Cubicle. The current room is the Cubicle, which has exits to the south and west. The user's last action was "go east" which led them here. Now, looking at the next steps in the original plan, after the Cubicle, the next direction mentioned was "go south" (from the original instructions: "Once you get through with that, attempt to go south. After that, attempt to go to the east. And then, go to the east. With that accomplished, venture north.").

Wait, but the user is in the Cubicle. The original plan after the Cubicle would be to go south, then east, then east, then north. However, the current room (Cubicle) has exits to south and west. The user's next action should be to go south, as per the original instructions. But let me check the original steps again to make sure.

Original steps: After the Bar (which was step 5), the user went back to Laundromat (step 6), then to Bar again (step 7), then to Cubicle (step 8). The original plan after the Bar was to go east, which led to the Cubicle. Then, according to the original instructions, after the Cubicle, the next step is to go south. So the user should go south from the Cubicle. But the user is at step 8, and the next action should be "go south" to proceed. However, the user's last action was "go east" to get to the Cubicle. So the next step is to go south from the Cubicle. But the user is at the Cubicle, and the exits are south and west. The original plan says after the Cubicle, go south, then east, then east, then north. So the next action is "go south" from the Cubicle. But the user is at step 8, and the next action should be "go south". However, the user's previous steps might have already covered some of these directions. But according to the original instructions, the user needs to follow the sequence: after the Cubicle, go south, then east, then east, then north. So the next action is "go south".

Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game where they have to navigate through different rooms and eventually pick up the passkey from the spare room. The instructions given earlier mention a specific sequence of directions: go east, south, west, south, west, south, east, east, north, and then collect the passkey.

So far, the user has been moving through the rooms: Parlor → Shower → Sauna → Laundromat → Bar → Laundromat → Bar → Cubicle → Studio. The current room is the Studio. The next step in the sequence after the Studio would be to go west, as per the earlier instructions. The Studio's description mentions that if you don't like doors, you can go north, but if you need an unblocked exit, you should go west. Since the user is following the predefined path, the correct next action here is to go west. That leads to the next room, which would be the Spare Room where the passkey is located. So the next command should be "go west".
</think>go west

-= Spare Room =-
I never took you for the sort of person who would show up in a spare room, but I guess I was wrong.



There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

There is a passkey on the floor.

Okay, let's see. The user has been moving through different rooms in the game, following a pattern of going east, south, west, etc. The goal was to pick up the passkey from the spare room. The last room they were in was the Spare Room, where the passkey is on the floor.

The current room is the Spare Room. The user's next action should be to pick up the passkey. Since the passkey is on the floor, the correct command would be "take passkey". The previous steps led them here, and now they just need to collect the item. The game's goal is to pick up the passkey, so that's the immediate action. No need to move around anymore once the item is obtained.
