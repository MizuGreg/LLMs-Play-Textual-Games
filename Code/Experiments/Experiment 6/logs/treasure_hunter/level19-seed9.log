Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First thing I need you to do is to move south. Then, open the gateway inside the studio. If you have pulled open the gateway, head west. After that, travel south. Following that, open the passageway. And then, attempt to go to the south. With that accomplished, attempt to take a trip west. Then, venture north. And then, retrieve the poem from the floor of the bedchamber. And if you do that, you're the winner!

You've entered an office. You can barely contain your excitement.



There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

You are in an usual kind of place. That is to say, you're in a studio.

You can make out a stand. The stand is normal. However, the stand, like an empty stand, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is a closed gateway leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game and needs to follow a series of steps to win. The current location is the Studio. The previous action was moving south from the Office to the Studio. Now, the user has to open the gateway inside the studio. The prompt says to first move south, then open the gateway west, then go south again, open the passageway, attempt to go south again, take a trip west, venture north, and retrieve the poem from the bedchamber.

In the current Studio environment, there's a closed gateway leading west. The user's next step should be to open that gateway. The instruction says after moving south (which was done), open the gateway inside the studio. So the next action should be to open the gateway. The command would be "open gateway" or something similar. But looking at the environment description, the gateway is closed and leads west. So the correct action here is to open it. The user needs to interact with the gateway to open it. Therefore, the next command should be "open gateway west" or just "open gateway". But in TextWorld, the commands are usually more direct. Since the gateway is described as closed and leading west, the correct action is to open it. So the next step is to open the gateway.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text adventure game. The goal is to follow a series of steps: move south, open the gateway, go west, south again, open the passageway, then go south, west, north, and retrieve the poem from the bedchamber.

So far, the user has entered the Office, gone south to the Studio, opened the gateway. The next step according to the instructions was to head west after opening the gateway. The user did that, and the game moved them west. Now, the next step in the original instructions was to travel south again. 

Looking at the current location, after opening the gateway and going west, the user is in a new area. The next action should be to go south. The user's last action was "open gateway", and the response was "You open gateway." Then the user is prompted again. So the next step is to go south from the current position. 

The user needs to follow the exact sequence: after opening the gateway, go west. Then travel south. So after going west, the next command should be "go south". The user has already done that, but let me check the history again. Wait, the user's previous action was "open gateway", which was correct. Then the next step was to head west. The user did that, and the game moved them west. Now, the next step is to travel south again. So the next command should be "go south". 

The user is at the Studio, opened the gateway, went west. Now they are in a new location. The next step is to go south. The user needs to input "go south" again. Then, after that, they need to open the passageway. So the next action is definitely "go south" here. The user should follow the steps in order. The answer should be "go south".

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game, and they've followed some instructions. Let me recap the steps to make sure I understand the current situation.

The user started in the Office, went south to the Studio. Then they opened the gateway west, but the next step was supposed to be going west after opening it. However, when they tried to go south again, they couldn't. Wait, the original instructions said after opening the gateway, head west. Then travel south. But maybe the movement is restricted by the environment.

So, after opening the gateway, the user was in the Studio. The gateway was closed, so they opened it, and now they can go west. But the user tried to go south again, which was blocked. So maybe after opening the gateway, they need to go west first. Let me check the previous steps again.

Original steps: Move south (from Office to Studio), open gateway (which is west), then head west. Then travel south. Then open passageway, then go south again, west, north, retrieve the poem.

But in the current state, after opening the gateway, the user tried to go south again, which is not possible. So maybe the correct next step is to go west after opening the gateway. The user tried to go south again, which was blocked, so they need to go west instead. Then, after going west, they can proceed south as per the instructions. So the next action should be 'go west' to move through the opened gateway. Then, from there, travel south. Let me make sure that's the correct path. The user is in the Studio, after opening the gateway west, so going west would take them through the gateway. Then, from the other side, they can go south. So the next command should be 'go west'.

Guess what, you are in a place we're calling an attic.

Were you looking for a suitcase? Because look over there, it's a suitcase. You can make out a locker. You can see a display.

There is an open gateway leading east. There is an open hatch leading north. There is an open door leading south.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in this text-based game. They started by going south from the office to the studio. Then they opened the gateway west, but that led them to the attic. Now, they need to continue following the instructions given at the beginning.

The original plan was: after opening the gateway in the studio, go west, then travel south, open the passageway, attempt to go south again, take a trip west, venture north, and retrieve the poem from the bedchamber.

But in the current scenario, after opening the gateway in the studio, the user tried to go south but couldn't. Then they went west, arriving at the attic. The attic has a gateway east, a hatch north, and a door south. The next step here would be to check which direction aligns with the original plan.

The original steps after the studio's gateway were: go west (which they did, leading to the attic), then travel south. But in the attic, the south direction is a door. So maybe they should go south from the attic. However, the user's previous action was going west, and now they're in the attic. The next step according to the plan is to travel south from the studio after opening the gateway, but that was blocked. So perhaps the correct path now is to go south from the attic. Alternatively, maybe they need to go north from the attic, but the original plan didn't mention that. Wait, the original plan after opening the gateway in the studio was to go west (which they did), then travel south. But in the studio, after opening the gateway west, they tried to go south but couldn't. Then they went west to the attic. Now, in the attic, the south is a door. So maybe they should go south from the attic. But the original plan said after opening the gateway in the studio, go west, then travel south. But in the studio, going south was blocked. So perhaps the correct path now is to go south from the attic. Alternatively, maybe they need to go north from the attic, but that's not part of the original plan. The original plan after the attic would be to open the passageway, but the user hasn't reached that yet. So the next step is to go south from the attic, as per the original plan's "travel south" after opening the gateway in the studio. But since they are now in the attic, maybe going south from here is the next step. Alternatively, maybe they need to go east or north. But according to the original plan, after opening the gateway in the studio, go west (which they did), then travel south. So perhaps from the studio, after opening the gateway, they should go west (to the attic), then from the attic, go south. But in the attic, the south is a door. So the next action should be go south.

Okay, let's break down the user's journey so far. They started in the Office, went South to the Studio. Then they opened the gateway West, but that led them to the Attic. From there, they went South again to the Basement. Now, the next step according to the initial instructions was after opening the passageway, attempt to go south again. But in the Basement, there's a closed passageway South, an open door North, and an exit West.

Wait, the user's previous action was going South from the Attic to the Basement. Now, in the Basement, the next logical step would be to check the closed passageway South, as per the original plan. The user needs to open the passageway first. But the user's last action was going South, which might have been a mistake because the passageway is closed. So the correct next step is to open the passageway South. But the user might not have done that yet. Let me check the original instructions again.

Original instructions: After opening the gateway (which they did), head west, then travel south. Then open the passageway, then attempt to go south again. Then take a trip west, then venture north, then retrieve the poem.

So after the Basement, the next step is to open the passageway leading south. But in the Basement, the passageway is closed. So the user needs to open it. But the user's last action was going South from the Attic to the Basement. Now, in the Basement, the passageway South is closed. So the next action should be to open that passageway. However, the user might not have the ability to open it yet. Wait, the user is in the Basement, and the passageway is closed. So the correct next step is to open the passageway. But the user's last action was going South, which might have been incorrect. So the user needs to open the passageway first. But the user's last action was go south, which might have been a mistake. Therefore, the correct next action is to open the passageway South in the Basement. But the user's last action was going South, which led them to the Basement. So maybe the user needs to open the passageway now. However, the user's next action should be to open the passageway. But the user's last action was go south, which might have been a mistake. Therefore, the correct next step is to open the passageway. But the user is in the Basement, and the passageway is closed. So the next action is to open it. But the user might not have the ability to open it. Wait, the user is in the Basement, and the passageway is closed. So the user needs to open it. But how? The user might need to use a key or something. But in the current context, the user is supposed to open the passageway. So the next action should be to open the passageway. However, the user's last action was going south, which might have been a mistake. Therefore, the correct next action is to open the passageway. But the user is in the Basement, and the passageway is closed. So the correct next action is to open the passageway. Therefore, the user should say "open passageway".

The user just opened that passageway, so the next logical step would be to go south through it. However, the user's last action was opening the passageway, and the prompt says to say the next command. So the correct action here is to go south.

Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text adventure game, and they've followed a series of instructions to move through different rooms. The goal is to retrieve the poem from the bedchamber.

So far, they started in the Office, moved to the Studio, opened the gateway, went west to the Attic, then south to the Basement, opened the passageway, and went south again to the Sauna. Now, they're in the Sauna, and the next step according to the original instructions was to attempt to go south again. But in the Sauna, the possible directions are north, east, west, and there's a sponge on the floor. The user's last action was "go south", which led them to the Sauna. Now, they need to continue following the original plan.

The original steps after opening the passageway and going south (to the Sauna) were to "attempt to go to the south" again, then "take a trip west", then "venture north", and finally "retrieve the poem from the floor of the bedchamber".

But in the Sauna, going south might not be possible. The current room description says there's an open passageway north, exit west, and the user is in the Sauna. So maybe the next step is to go west, as per the original plan. Alternatively, maybe they need to go north from the Sauna. But the original plan said after the Sauna, they should go west, then north, then retrieve the poem.

Wait, the user's last action was "go south" which brought them to the Sauna. Now, the next step in the original instructions was to "attempt to go to the south" again. But in the Sauna, going south might not be possible. The room description doesn't mention a south direction. So maybe the user needs to go west from the Sauna. The original plan said after the Sauna, they should take a trip west. So the next action should be "go west".

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go north from the Sauna. But according to the original plan, after the Sauna, the next step was to go west. So the correct action here is "go west".
