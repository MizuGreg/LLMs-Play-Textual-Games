Welcome to TextWorld! First of all, you could, like, go west. With that accomplished, make an attempt to go to the north. And then, assure that the hatch within the canteen is open. After that, venture west. With that accomplished, make it so that the portal in the bedchamber is ajar. Once you have pulled open the portal, make an attempt to move west. And then, make an effort to go to the south. That done, recover the latchkey from the floor of the closet. Alright, thanks!
