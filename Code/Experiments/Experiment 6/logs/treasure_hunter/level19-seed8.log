Welcome to TextWorld! Here is how to play! First of all, make an effort to head north. With that accomplished, ensure that the passageway is open. After that, make an effort to move east. Then, lift the nest of earwigs from the floor of the attic. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Laundry Place =-
This might come as a shock to you, but you've just stumbled into a laundry place. You begin looking for stuff.

You can make out a board. You wonder idly who left that here. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Sometimes, just sometimes, TextWorld can just be the worst.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north.

-= Cubicle =-
You are in a cubicle. A standard one. The room is well lit.

You can see a safe. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You can make out a table. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is a closed passageway leading east. There is a closed portal leading north. There is an open hatch leading west. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Attic =-
You've stumbled into an usual room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be usual. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the attic.

You make out a workbench. The workbench is typical. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is an open passageway leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

There is a nest of earwigs on the floor.

That's not a verb I recognise.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this TextWorld game. They've gone through the Laundry Place, Cubicle, and now the Attic. The goal is to lift the nest of earwigs and win.

In the Attic, they saw the nest of earwigs on the floor. They tried to "lift nest of earwigs" but got an error. The system said that's not a recognized verb. So maybe the correct command is just "lift" without specifying the object, or maybe "take" instead. But in the game's context, the correct action might be "lift nest of earwigs" but the system doesn't accept it. Alternatively, perhaps the game expects a different phrasing.

Wait, the user's last action was "lift nest of earwigs", which the system rejected. The user then asks if they're close to the goal. The assistant needs to figure out the correct next step. Since the game's goal is to lift the nest, maybe the correct command is just "lift" without the object, or maybe "take nest of earwigs". But the game might require the exact phrasing. Alternatively, maybe the nest is considered a collectible item, so the correct command is "take nest of earwigs".

But the user tried "lift" and it didn't work. The system's response was "That's not a verb I recognise." So perhaps the correct verb is "take" instead of "lift". Let me check the possible commands. In TextWorld, common verbs are "take", "use", "open", "go", etc. So maybe the correct command is "take nest of earwigs".

Alternatively, maybe the game expects "lift" but the object is already specified. Wait, the user's previous action was "lift nest of earwigs", which was rejected. So maybe the correct command is just "lift" and the game will recognize it. But the system said it's not a recognized verb. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the game expects the player to use "take" instead. So the next action should be "take nest of earwigs". Let me try that. The user's next command should be "take nest of earwigs". But the user is supposed to only output the action, nothing else. So the correct answer here is "take nest of earwigs".
</think>take nest of earwigs
