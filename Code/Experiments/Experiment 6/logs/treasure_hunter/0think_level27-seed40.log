Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. Your first objective is to try to take a trip west. That done, move west. That done, make an attempt to venture north. And then, try to move west. Then, move north. Then, make an effort to head east. Then, go east. After that, try to move south. With that done, take a trip east. Then, venture north. And then, travel east. Once you get through with that, take a trip south. With that done, make an attempt to travel south. With that done, pick up the candy bar from the floor of the garage. Alright, thanks!
