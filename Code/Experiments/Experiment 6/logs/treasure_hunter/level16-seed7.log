Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First step, go to the south. Okay, and then, go to the east. If you can finish that, make an effort to take a trip north. And then, try to venture north. Once you finish that, make an attempt to head east. Following that, recover the latchkey from the pan in the cookhouse. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Recreation Zone =-
You've entered a recreation zone.



There is an open passageway leading north. There is an open hatch leading south.

-= Laundry Place =-
You have walked into a laundry place. Not the laundry place you'd expect. No, this is a laundry place. You begin looking for stuff.

You can see an opened cabinet, which looks ordinary, in the corner. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You make out a table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

There is an open portal leading east. There is an open hatch leading north.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they need to follow a series of directions to find a latchkey in the cookhouse. So far, they've gone south from the Recreation Zone into the Laundry Place. The current location is the Laundry Place, which has a cabinet, a table, a portal east, and a hatch north.

The user's previous action was "go south", which led them here. Now, they need to continue following the initial instructions. The original instructions said: go south, then east, then north, then east again, and then recover the latchkey from the pan in the cookhouse.

In the current location (Laundry Place), the available directions are east and north. The next step according to the plan is to go east. But wait, the user's last action was going south, and the next step in the original instructions was to go east. But the user is now in the Laundry Place. Let me check the original steps again.

Original steps: First, go to the south (which they did, leading to Laundry Place). Then go east. So from the Laundry Place, the next direction should be east. The Laundry Place has an open portal leading east, so "go east" is possible. Then, after going east, they would be in a new location. The next steps are to go north, then east again, then find the latchkey.

But the user is asking if they're on the right track. The user is in the Laundry Place, and the next logical step according to the initial instructions is to go east. So the correct next action would be "go east". However, the user's previous action was "go south", and now they need to go east. The user's next action should be "go east" to follow the original plan. Then, after that, they would proceed north, then east again, and finally find the latchkey.

But wait, the user's current location is Laundry Place. The original instructions after going south (to Laundry Place) say to go east. So the next step is indeed "go east". Therefore, the correct next command is "go east".
</think>go east

-= Bedroom =-
Guess what, you are in a place we're calling a bedroom. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.



There is an open gate leading north. There is an open portal leading west.

There is a loaf of bread on the floor.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this TextWorld game, and they've been moving through different areas: first to the south, then east, and now they're in a bedroom. The original goal was to go south, east, north, east again, and then retrieve the latchkey from the pan in the cookhouse.

So far, they've gone south (to the laundry place), then east (to the bedroom). The next steps in the original instructions were to try to go north from there. The bedroom has an open gate leading north and a portal west. The user is currently in the bedroom. The next action should be to go north, as per the initial plan. The user might not have realized that the next step after the bedroom is to go north again. The cookhouse hasn't been reached yet, so continuing north makes sense. The latchkey is in the cookhouse, so moving north from the bedroom would be the next logical step. The user needs to follow the sequence: south, east, north, east, then cookhouse. So the next command should be "go north".

-= Bathroom =-
You find yourself in a bathroom. A standard kind of place.

Were you looking for a board? Because look over there, it's a board. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is an open gateway leading north. There is an open gate leading south.



>                                                                                                                                -= Bathroom =-0/4

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is navigating through different rooms in this TextWorld game. The original goal was to go south, then east, north, east again, and finally retrieve the latchkey from the pan in the cookhouse. So far, the user has moved from the Recreation Zone to the Laundry Place, then to the Bedroom, and now to the Bathroom.

The current room is the Bathroom, which has a gateway leading north and south. The user's next step would logically be to continue moving north as per the initial instructions. But wait, the user was supposed to go south, east, north, east, and then head to the cookhouse. However, the path so far has been south (from Recreation Zone to Laundry Place), east (to Bedroom), north (to Bathroom). The next step in the original plan was to venture north again, but from the Bathroom, going north would be the next direction. However, the user might need to check if the cookhouse is in a different direction. But according to the current rooms, the Bathroom has a north and south gateway. The original plan mentioned going north again, so maybe the next step is to go north from the Bathroom. But the user needs to check if that's the right path. Alternatively, maybe the cookhouse is in the east direction from somewhere. But the user hasn't reached the cookhouse yet. The original goal was to recover the latchkey from the pan in the cookhouse. So maybe after moving north from the Bathroom, the user would reach another room, perhaps the cookhouse. But the user hasn't encountered the cookhouse yet. Alternatively, maybe the cookhouse is in the south direction from the Bathroom. But the Bathroom has a south gate leading back to the Bedroom. Hmm. The user's current position is the Bathroom. The next step in the original instructions was to "try to venture north" after the previous steps. So the user should go north again. Let me check the previous steps again. The initial instructions said: go south, then east, then north, then east, then recover the latchkey. So after the Bathroom, the next direction would be north again? Or maybe east? Wait, the user is in the Bathroom, which has a north and south gate. The original plan after the Bathroom would be to go north again? Or maybe the cookhouse is in the east direction from the Bedroom. But the user hasn't checked east from the Bedroom yet. Wait, the user was in the Bedroom, then went north to the Bathroom. The Bedroom had a portal leading west (back to Laundry Place) and a gate leading north (to Bathroom). The original plan after the Bedroom was to venture north, which the user did. Now in the Bathroom, the next step would be to go north again, but that might not be the right direction. Alternatively, maybe the cookhouse is in the south direction from the Bathroom, but that's back to the Bedroom. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east from the Bathroom. But the Bathroom doesn't have an east exit. The Bathroom has north and south. So perhaps the next step is to go north again. But the user needs to check if that's the right path. Alternatively, maybe the cookhouse is in the east direction from the Laundry Place. But the user hasn't checked that yet. However, according to the original instructions, after going east from the Laundry Place (which is the Bedroom), the next step was to venture north, which the user did. Now in the Bathroom, the next step would be to go north again. But the user needs to make sure that they are moving towards the cookhouse. Alternatively, maybe the cookhouse is in the south direction from the Bathroom. But that would take them back to the Bedroom. The user's goal is to reach the cookhouse and get the latchkey. So perhaps the user needs to check the east direction from the Bathroom, but there's no east exit. Therefore, the next logical step is to go north again. However, the user might need to check the cookhouse's location. But based on the current rooms, the user hasn't encountered the cookhouse yet. So the next step is to go north from the Bathroom. But the user's original plan was to go north again after the previous steps. So the answer should be to go north.

-= Cubicle =-
I am sorry to announce that you are now in the cubicle.

You see a coffer. You make out an opened trunk. The trunk is empty! What a waste of a day!

There is an open gateway leading south. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east.



>                                                                                                                                -= Cubicle =-0/5

Okay, let's see. The user is navigating through different rooms in this TextWorld game. The original goal was to go south, then east, north, east again, and finally recover the latchkey from the pan in the cookhouse. So far, they've gone south to the Laundry Place, then east to the Bedroom, north to the Bathroom, and then north again to the Cubicle.

Now, in the Cubicle, the description mentions a coffer and an opened trunk that's empty. The hint says there's an unguarded exit leading east. The user is at the Cubicle, and the next step might be to go east. But the original plan was after going north from the Bathroom, then east. Wait, the user just went north from the Bathroom to the Cubicle. The next step in the original instructions was to venture north again, then east. But maybe the path is different.

Wait, the user's current location is the Cubicle. The available exits are south and east. The hint says to try going east. So maybe the next action should be east. But the original goal was to recover the latchkey from the cookhouse. So far, the user hasn't reached the cookhouse yet. The path might require moving east from the Cubicle. Let me check the previous steps again.

Original steps: go south (done), east (done), north (done), east (done?), then recover the latchkey. But in the current location, the user is in the Cubicle. The next step according to the hint is to go east. So the next action should be go east. That would take them to the next room. Then, perhaps they can continue towards the cookhouse. The user needs to follow the path, moving east from the Cubicle. So the next command is go east.

-= Cookhouse =-
Wow! You're in a cookhouse. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You make out a pan. The pan is ordinary. On the pan you see a latchkey. You scan the room, seeing a bowl. However, the bowl, like an empty bowl, has nothing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the bowl.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.



>                                                                                                                                -= Cookhouse =-0/6

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Cookhouse, and they need to recover the latchkey from the pan. The previous steps led them here, so the next logical move is to pick up the latchkey. The instruction says to take the latchkey from the pan, so the command should be "take latchkey from pan". But wait, the user has to make sure they're doing the right action. Let me check the environment again.

In the Cookhouse description, the pan has the latchkey on it. The user is supposed to take it. The available exits are west, but the main goal is to retrieve the latchkey. So the correct action here is to take the latchkey from the pan. The user has been moving through the areas as instructed, and now the final step is to pick up the item. So the next command should be "take latchkey from pan".
