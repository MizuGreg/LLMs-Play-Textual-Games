Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. Your first objective is to make an attempt to move west. And then, venture south. If you can manage that, make an attempt to head east. After that, pick-up the passkey from the floor of the pantry. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Cookery =-
You are in a cookery. A normal kind of place.



You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

-= Garage =-
You've entered a garage. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

-= Cookhouse =-
You find yourself in a cookhouse. A normal kind of place.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

There is a cookie on the floor.
