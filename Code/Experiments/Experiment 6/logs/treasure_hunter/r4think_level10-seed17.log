Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game where they have to navigate through different rooms and collect a passkey to win. The current setup is that they've moved from the studio to the laundromat, then to the shower. The original goal was to move north, then north again, then east, south, pick up the passkey, and win.

Wait, the user's first objective was to move north, then make an effort to venture north again, then east, then south. Then pick up the passkey. So far, they've gone north from studio to laundromat, then north again to shower. Now, the next step according to the original plan was to go east. But in the shower room, the prompt says to try going east or south. The user's next action should be to go east, as per the original plan. The user is asking if they're making the right moves and if they're close. The answer is yes, they're on the right track. So the next command should be "go east".
</think>go east
