Then, try to take a trip south. Following that, attempt to head east. Okay, and then, attempt to travel east. After that, retrieve the tv from the floor of the salon. That's it!

Well, here we are in a playroom. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

You see a closed normal looking suitcase in the room.

There is an open door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

-= Cookery =-
You are in a cookery. A normal kind of place. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You can see a freezer. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a platter. You see a knife on the platter.

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

-= Kitchenette =-
You are in a kitchenette. A typical one. You begin to take stock of what's here.

There is an unguarded exit to the east. There is an unblocked exit to the north.
