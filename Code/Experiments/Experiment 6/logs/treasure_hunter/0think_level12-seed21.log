I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! First step, move south. Okay, and then, travel east. With that accomplished, recover the keycard from the floor of the kitchen. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Closet =-
You find yourself in a closet. An usual kind of place. You start to take note of what's in the room.



There is an open passageway leading east. There is an open portal leading south. There is an open door leading west.
