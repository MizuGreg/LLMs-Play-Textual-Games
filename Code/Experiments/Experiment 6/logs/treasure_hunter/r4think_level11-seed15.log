Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, you could, like, try to go to the east. Then, lift the sandwich from the floor of the shower. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Workshop =-
Ah, the workshop. This is some kind of workshop, really great standard vibes in this place, a wonderful standard atmosphere. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

You can see an opened safe. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You make out a stand. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.

There is an unguarded exit to the east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north.

-= Shower =-
You've just sauntered into a shower.



There is an open gateway leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

There is a sandwich on the floor.

That's not a verb I recognise.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is playing a text-based game where they need to lift a sandwich from the shower and then go east. The current room is the shower, and there's a sandwich on the floor. The user tried "lift sandwich" but got an error because that's not a recognized verb.

Hmm, maybe the correct command is "take sandwich" instead of "lift". In many text games, "take" is the standard verb for picking up items. Let me check the previous messages. The user was told to "lift the sandwich from the floor of the shower", but the game might expect "take" instead. So the next action should be "take sandwich". That makes sense. I should make sure to use the correct command. Also, the user is in the shower room, and the exit to the west is unblocked. But the main goal is to lift the sandwich. So the correct command here is "take sandwich".
