Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, you could, like, make an effort to move south. Then, ensure that the hatch within the cellar is open. After you have opened the hatch, head south. And then, open the portal. And then, attempt to head south. Then, move west. With that accomplished, make an effort to go to the north. Following that, go west. Then, pick up the peanut from the floor of the studio. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Pantry =-
You've entered a pantry. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

An open chest is close by. The chest is empty, what a horrible day! Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. But the thing is empty. Look over there! a shelf. The shelf is normal. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

There is an open gate leading south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.
