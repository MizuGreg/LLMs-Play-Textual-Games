Welcome to TextWorld! First stop, move south. And then, make an attempt to move south. Once you manage that, pick up the keycard from the floor of the bar. That's it!

-= Sauna =-
You're now in the sauna.

You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a board. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The board is usual. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You scan the room, seeing a chipped counter. You wonder idly who left that here. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

-= Canteen =-
You've entered a canteen.

You make out a locked fridge.

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

-= Bar =-
Of every bar you could have shown up in, you had to come round an ordinary one.

You see a basket.

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

There is a keycard on the floor.
