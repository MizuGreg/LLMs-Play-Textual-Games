I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is how to play! First stop, look and see that the hatch in the shower is wide open. And then, venture south. Then, move east. And then, make an attempt to move south. And then, go west. After that, make an attempt to go to the south. With that accomplished, take a trip south. And then, try to head east. If you can succeed at that, head north. Next, make an attempt to venture east. Once you manage that, take a trip north. Then, retrieve the passkey from the floor of the attic. Got that? Good!

-= Shower =-
You've just sauntered into a shower.



There is a closed hatch leading south. There is an open gateway leading east.

-= Dish-Pit =-
This is going to sound unbelievable, but you've just entered a dish-pit.

You make out a plate. The plate appears to be empty. You see a chair. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a chair? Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You can make out a bowl. However, the bowl, like an empty bowl, has nothing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

-= Bedroom =-
You arrive in a bedroom. A typical kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You can see an opened trunk, which looks standard, in the corner. What a letdown! The trunk is empty!

There is an open hatch leading north. There is an open passageway leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

Ah, the study. This is some kind of study, really great standard vibes in this place, a wonderful standard atmosphere. The room is well lit.
