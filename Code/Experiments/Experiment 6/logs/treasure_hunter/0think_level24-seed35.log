Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an profound round of TextWorld? You do! Here is your task for today. First off, make an attempt to move west. And then, check that the non-euclidean portal is unlocked with the non-euclidean keycard. After that, open the non-euclidean portal in the studio. After that, go west. Then, try to move north. With that over with, go to the west. Next, go to the north. With that done, attempt to travel north. With that accomplished, lift the gummy bear from the floor of the cellar. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Study =-
You have come into a study. Not the study you'd expect. No, this is a study.



There is an open hatch leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.

-= Office =-
You arrive in an office. A typical one.

You smell a sickening smell, and follow it to a portmanteau. The portmanteau is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever!

There is an open non-euclidean portal leading east. There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

-= Canteen =-
You've just shown up in a canteen.

You can make out a shelf. You shudder, but continue examining the shelf. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You think about smashing the shelf to bits, throwing the bits into a pit, etc, until you get bored. You see a plate. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can make out a bowl. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. You see a pan. The pan is ordinary. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

-= Kitchen =-
You've just walked into a kitchen. You start to take note of what's in the room.

Hey, want to see a chest? Look over there, a chest. Classic TextWorld. The chest is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You can see a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it.

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Restroom =-
You arrive in a restroom. An usual one.

You can see a box. The box is empty! What a waste of a day! You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a dresser. Classic TextWorld.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

You've entered a cellar.

You make out a coffer. You wonder idly who left that here.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unblocked exit to the north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

There is a gummy bear on the floor.
