I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First thing I need you to do is to make an attempt to travel south. Following that, try to take a trip east. After that, pick up the latchkey from the floor of the studio. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Study =-
You've just walked into a study.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.
