You are now playing a exciting round of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First thing I need you to do is to make an effort to go north. With that accomplished, take a trip east. If you can get through with that, move south. With that done, recover the butterfly from the floor of the sauna. Alright, thanks!

-= Cellar =-
You've entered a cellar. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."



There is an unblocked exit to the north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

-= Bedroom =-
You've entered a bedroom. You begin to take stock of what's here.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

There is a laptop on the floor.

-= Cookery =-
You've just shown up in a cookery. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

You're now in the sauna.
