Welcome to another exciting game of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First, it would be great if you could travel south. Okay, and then, make an attempt to take a trip west. After that, make an effort to move south. And then, make an effort to venture south. And then, move east. Then, move north. With that done, go east. Once you manage that, pick-up the passkey from the floor of the bar. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Cookhouse =-
You find yourself in a cookhouse. A standard one.

You can see a closed chest in the corner. You see a counter. The counter is ordinary. But the thing is empty. Hm. Oh well

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game and has been moving through different rooms: Cookhouse, Studio, Scullery, Chamber, and now Closet. The goal mentioned earlier was to pick up the passkey from the bar's floor after moving through certain directions.

So far, the user has gone south from Cookhouse to Studio, then west to Scullery, south again to Chamber, and then south again to Closet. The current room is Closet, where there's an opened locker that's empty. The prompts suggest exiting east or north. 

The user is asking if they're on the right track and close to the goal. The previous steps involved moving south multiple times, but the passkey is in the bar, which might be in a different area. The user might have missed a key direction. Let me check the path again.

Original instructions: go south, then west, then south, then south, then east, north, east, then pick up the passkey. But in the current path, after Closet, the next steps might be to go north or east. If they go north from Closet, they might return to Chamber, then maybe east to exit. But the passkey is in the bar, which might be in the Studio or another area. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east from Closet to reach the bar.

Wait, in the Scullery, there's an exit to the south (which led to Chamber), but the bar might be in the Studio. The user needs to find the passkey in the bar's floor. Maybe after exiting Closet, they should go east to reach the bar area. But the current room is Closet, so the next move should be east or north. The user might need to go east from Closet to proceed towards the bar. Let me check the possible exits again.

In Closet, the user can go east or north. If they go east, they might exit to the Studio or another area. But the passkey is in the bar, which is probably in the Studio. However, the Studio has a locked toolbox and a closed bureau. Maybe the user needs to open the toolbox or bureau to find the passkey. But the original instruction said to pick up the passkey from the floor of the bar. So perhaps the bar is in the Studio, and the user needs to go back to Studio, open the toolbox, and then take the passkey.

But the user is currently in Closet. The next step should be to go east to exit the closet and return to the Chamber or another area. Then, maybe go north to the Studio. From Studio, they can check the toolbox or bureau. But the user's current position is Closet, so the next action should be to go east or north. Since the user is asking if they're close, maybe they need to go east from Closet to reach the bar area. Alternatively, go north to Chamber and then east to exit. But the original path required moving east after going north. 

The user's current position is Closet. The correct next step would be to go east to exit the closet and proceed towards the bar. So the next command should be "go east".

-= Canteen =-
You've entered a canteen. Let's see what's in here.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

You've entered a laundromat.

You see a bench. The bench is typical. But the thing is empty.

There is an unblocked exit to the east. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's recap the user's journey so far. They started in the Cookhouse, went south to the Studio, west to the Scullery, south to the Chamber, then south again to the Closet. From there, they went east to the Canteen and north to the Laundromat. The goal is to pick up the passkey from the bar's floor.

The user is now in the Laundromat, which has exits to east, north, south, and west. The original path mentioned moving east after going north, then eventually reaching the bar. But the user hasn't seen the bar yet. Maybe the bar is in a different area. Let's think about the possible paths.

In the Studio, there's a locked toolbox and a closed bureau. The passkey might be in the bar, which could be connected to the Laundromat or another room. Since the user is in the Laundromat, they need to find the correct exit leading to the bar. The exits here are east, north, south, west. The user needs to check which direction leads to the bar.

Earlier, in the Scullery, there was an exit to the south (Chamber), and in the Chamber, south again to Closet. Now, in Laundromat, maybe going west would take them back to the Canteen, then north to the Studio. Alternatively, going east might lead to the bar. But the user hasn't found the passkey yet. The passkey is in the bar's floor, so they need to reach the bar.

Perhaps the correct path is to go west from Laundromat to Canteen, then north to Studio, check the toolbox or bureau for the passkey. But the user's previous steps might have missed that. Alternatively, maybe the bar is in the Laundromat itself, but the description doesn't mention a bar here. The user needs to find the right exit to reach the bar area.

Since the user is in Laundromat, the next step should be to check which direction leads to the bar. The original instructions said to go east after moving north. But in the current position, the user is in Laundromat. Maybe going south from Laundromat would take them to the Canteen again, then west to Scullery, but that's going back. Alternatively, going east from Laundromat might lead to the bar. The user needs to try east to proceed towards the bar.
