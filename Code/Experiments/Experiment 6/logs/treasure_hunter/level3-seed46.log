You are now playing a exciting session of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First step, make an attempt to travel east. Then, pick-up the keycard from the floor of the garage. That's it!

-= Studio =-
You've entered a studio.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.
