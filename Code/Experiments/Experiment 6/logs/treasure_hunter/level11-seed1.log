Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to go north. Once you get around to doing that, recover the passkey from the bench. Alright, thanks!

-= Closet =-
You arrive in a closet. A normal one.

You scan the room for a rack, and you find a rack. The rack is normal. But there isn't a thing on it. You see a workbench. However, the workbench, like an empty workbench, has nothing on it.

There is an open door leading north. There is an open passageway leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Bathroom =-
Of every bathroom you could have sauntered into, you had to walk into a standard one.

You can make out a closed dresser. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a bench. You see a passkey on the bench. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You make out a table. The table is ordinary. On the table you make out a bug.

There is an open door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they need to find a passkey. The previous steps were: first, they went north from the closet into a bathroom. In the bathroom, they found a passkey on the bench. Now, the user is asking if they're on the right track and what their next move should be.

The current location is the bathroom. The passkey was found here, so the next logical step is to pick it up. The user's last action was going north, which led them to the bathroom. Now, they need to interact with the bench where the passkey is. The command should be to take the passkey from the bench. The user needs to make sure they pick it up before moving on, as the goal is to recover the passkey. The response should only include the command, so "take passkey from bench" is the correct action here.
