I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is how to play! First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to take a trip south. Then, make an effort to take a trip east. And then, attempt to head north. Next, take a trip north. And then, take a trip north. Following that, make an attempt to go to the west. And then, go to the south. With that accomplished, pick up the potato from the floor of the kitchenette. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Sauna =-
You find yourself in a sauna. An ordinary kind of place. You can barely contain your excitement.

You scan the room for a shelf, and you find a shelf. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You make out a board. You wonder idly who left that here. The board is usual. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.
