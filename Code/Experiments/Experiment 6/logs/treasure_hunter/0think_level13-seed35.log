It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! First of all, make an attempt to travel west. If you can manage that, try to venture north. After that, make an attempt to go east. And then, retrieve the apple from the floor of the canteen. Got that? Good!

-= Lounge =-
You arrive in a lounge. A normal kind of place.

You see a closed locker in the corner. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a bookshelf. The bookshelf is standard. However, the bookshelf, like an empty bookshelf, has nothing on it.

There is an open door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

Ah, the cookery. This is some kind of cookery, really great usual vibes in this place, a wonderful usual atmosphere. And now, well, you're in it.

You make out a case.

There is an open door leading east. There is an open passageway leading north. There is an open portal leading south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

You've entered a kitchen.

You see a rack. The rack is ordinary. But the thing is empty. You move on, clearly done caring about your TextWorld experience.

-= Canteen =-
You find yourself in a canteen. An ordinary one.

You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a saucepan. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You move on, clearly done caring about your TextWorld experience.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

There is an apple and a passkey on the floor.
