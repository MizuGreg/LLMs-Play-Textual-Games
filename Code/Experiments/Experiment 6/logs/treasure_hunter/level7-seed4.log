Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First, it would be great if you could make an attempt to travel west. With that over with, take a trip north. That done, try to move north. And then, pick-up the knife from the floor of the cookhouse. Alright, thanks!

-= Pantry =-
You are in a pantry. A typical kind of place.



There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

There is a sock on the floor.

go west
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Parlor =-
Guess what, you are in a place we're calling a parlor. The room is well lit.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded.



>                                                                                                                                -= Parlor =-0/2
Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game, and they've been given a series of directions. The initial goal was to travel west, then north, then north again, and finally pick up a knife in the cookhouse.

First, the user started in the pantry. They went west, which led them to the parlor. Now, they're in the parlor. The next step according to the original instructions was to go north again. The parlor has an exit to the north, so that's probably the next move. But wait, the user is asking if they're on the right track and if they're close to the goal. 

The original plan was: go west (done), then north (done), then north again, then pick up the knife. But in the pantry, after going west to the parlor, the next step would be to go north from the parlor. However, the user is now in the parlor, and the next action should be to go north. But the user is asking if they're close. Maybe they're confused because they've only moved west and north once. But according to the initial instructions, after going west, they needed to go north, then north again. So from the parlor, going north would be the next step. Then, after that, they'd need to go to the cookhouse to pick up the knife. But the user hasn't mentioned the cookhouse yet. 

Wait, the original instructions said: after going west, take a trip north (so from pantry to parlor?), then try to move north again (from parlor to somewhere?), then pick up the knife in the cookhouse. So maybe after the parlor, going north would lead to another room, perhaps the cookhouse. But the user hasn't reached the cookhouse yet. So the next action should be to go north from the parlor. The user is asking if they're close, but they might not be. They need to continue moving north. So the correct next action is to go north again.
</think>go north

-= Shower =-
This might come as a shock to you, but you've just moved into a shower. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.



>                                                                                                                                -= Shower =-0/3
Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they have to navigate through different rooms and pick up a knife from the cookhouse. The original instructions were to go west, then north, then north again, and pick up the knife.

First, they started in the pantry, went west to the parlor, then north to the shower. Now they're in the shower. The next step would be to go north again, as per the initial instructions. But wait, the user is asking if they're on the right track. The rooms so far are pantry → parlor → shower. The cookhouse hasn't been reached yet. The knife is in the cookhouse, so they need to find the path to it.

Looking at the current room (shower), there's an exit to the north, east, and south. The user has been moving north each time. If they go north from the shower, maybe they'll reach the cookhouse. Alternatively, maybe the cookhouse is in a different direction. But according to the initial commands, after the shower, the next step would be to go north again. The user's previous actions were go west, go north, go north. So the next logical step is to go north again from the shower. The user is asking if they're close, so maybe they're on the right path. The answer should be to go north again.
</think>go north

-= Cookhouse =-
You've entered a cookhouse. You begin looking for stuff.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

There is a knife on the floor.


>                                                                                                                                -= Cookhouse =-0/4
Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they need to follow a series of steps. The original instructions were to go west, then north, then north again, and pick up the knife from the cookhouse.

First, they started in the pantry, went west to the parlor, then north to the shower, and then north again to the cookhouse. Now, in the cookhouse, they need to pick up the knife. The knife is on the floor here. The previous steps led them here, so the next logical action is to pick up the knife. The command should be "take knife" or "pick up knife". Since the game might expect a specific command, "take knife" is more likely. The user has to interact with the environment to collect items, so that's the correct action here.
