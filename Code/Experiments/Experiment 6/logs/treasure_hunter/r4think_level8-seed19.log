It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First step, make an attempt to go south. Then, try to travel west. After that, go south. Then, lift the passkey from the floor of the cubicle. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Cookhouse =-
Well, here we are in the cookhouse.



There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

You have stumbled into the most usual of all possible garages. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.



There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

-= Basement =-
You find yourself in a basement. An ordinary kind of place. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

I am sorry to announce that you are now in the cubicle.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north.

There is a passkey and a key on the floor.

That's not a verb I recognise.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text adventure game, and they've reached the Cubicle room. The goal is to lift the passkey from the floor of the cubicle. The user tried "lift passkey" but got an error. Then they tried "lift the passkey" again, which also didn't work. Now they're asking if they're making the right actions and if they're close to the goal.

First, I need to recall the game's context. The user has navigated through the Cookhouse, Garage, and Basement, ending up in the Cubicle. The Cubicle has a passkey and a key on the floor. The instruction says to lift the passkey. The previous attempts to use "lift passkey" and "lift the passkey" resulted in errors. Maybe the correct command is just "lift passkey" without the article, but the game's parser is strict. Alternatively, maybe the correct verb is "take" instead of "lift". But the problem statement says to "lift the passkey from the floor of the cubicle," so "lift" is the intended verb.

Wait, the user's last input was "lift the passkey" which the game rejected. The error message says "That's not a verb I recognise." So maybe the game expects "take" instead of "lift". But the original instruction says to "lift the passkey". Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the game requires the object to be specified with the correct preposition. For example, "lift passkey from floor" or something similar. But the user is supposed to just use the command as per the game's expectations.

Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "take passkey". Let me check the game's possible commands. In many text adventures, "take" is the verb used to pick up items. So perhaps the user should use "take passkey" instead of "lift passkey". But the original problem statement says to "lift the passkey", so maybe the game is expecting "lift" as the verb. However, the game's parser might not recognize "lift" as a valid verb for picking up items. That's a possibility.

Alternatively, maybe the game is using a different set of verbs. For example, "get" instead of "take" or "lift". But the user's instruction says to "lift", so perhaps the game is expecting that. However, the user's previous attempts with "lift passkey" and "lift the passkey" both failed. So maybe the correct command is "take passkey".

But the user is supposed to follow the initial instructions, which say to "lift the passkey from the floor of the cubicle". So maybe the game is expecting "lift" as the verb. However, the game's parser might not accept that. Alternatively, maybe the game requires the player to use "get" instead. But the user's problem is that the game is rejecting "lift passkey" as a command.

In this case, the user needs to try the correct command. Since the game is rejecting "lift passkey", maybe the correct verb is "take". So the next action should be "take passkey".

But the user's last input was "lift the passkey", which was rejected. So the correct command might be "take passkey". Therefore, the next action should be "take passkey".

Alternatively, maybe the game is expecting "lift passkey" without the article. Let me check the previous steps. The user tried "lift passkey" and got an error. Then tried "lift the passkey" and got the same error. So maybe the correct command is "take passkey".

Therefore, the next action should be "take passkey".
