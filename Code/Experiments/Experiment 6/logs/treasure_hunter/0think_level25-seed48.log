Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to try to take a trip west. Once you accomplish that, attempt to move west. Then, take a trip north. And then, go to the west. And then, make an attempt to take a trip south. Next, recover the latchkey from the floor of the kitchenette. Alright, thanks!

-= Kitchen =-
You've entered a kitchen. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."

You make out a fridge. The fridge is empty, what a horrible day!

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an unblocked exit to the south. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

There is a key on the floor.

-= Shower =-
Well, here we are in a shower. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You see a board. Now why would someone leave that there? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.
