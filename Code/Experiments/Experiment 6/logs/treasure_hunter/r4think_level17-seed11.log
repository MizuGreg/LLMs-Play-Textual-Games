Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an exciting round of TextWorld? You do! Here is how to play! First of all, you could, like, make an attempt to move south. That done, lift the teaspoon from the floor of the cookhouse. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Sauna =-
You find yourself in a sauna.



There is a closed portal leading west. There is an open door leading east. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

-= Cookhouse =-
You arrive in a standard kind of place. That is to say, you're in a cookhouse.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a teaspoon on the floor.

That's not a verb I recognise.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game, and they've been given some instructions. The goal is to lift the teaspoon and then win. So far, they tried to go south, which took them to the cookhouse. Then they tried to lift the teaspoon, but the game said that's not a recognized verb. Wait, maybe they need to use a different command.

Looking at the current scene in the cookhouse, there's a teaspoon on the floor. The user probably needs to pick it up. But the game didn't accept "lift teaspoon" as a valid command. Maybe the correct verb is "take" instead of "lift"? In many text adventures, "take" is the standard command for picking up items. Let me check the previous messages. The user tried "lift teaspoon" and got an error. So the correct command should be "take teaspoon".

Then, after taking the teaspoon, the next step is to go north to win. But the user is asking if they're close to the goal. Since they've already taken the teaspoon (assuming the command was corrected), they just need to go north. But the user might have made a mistake in the command. So the next action should be "take teaspoon" instead of "lift". Then, after that, go north. But the user's last action was "lift teaspoon", which was invalid. So the correct next step is to use "take" instead. Then, once the teaspoon is taken, go north to win.
