Welcome to another fast paced episode of TextWorld! First of all, you could, like, move west. Then, head north. After that, open the portal. After that, make an effort to go west. With that done, take a trip north. Okay, and then, go to the east. With that done, pick up the passkey from the floor of the office. And if you do that, you're the winner!
