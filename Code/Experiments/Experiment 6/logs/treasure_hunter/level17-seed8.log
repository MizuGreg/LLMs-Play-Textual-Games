You are now playing a life changing game of TextWorld! First stop, ensure that the gateway is open. After that, make an effort to move east. Then, open the portal. Then, try to take a trip south. After that, make sure that the passageway is ajar. After opening the passageway, make an effort to travel east. After that, pick-up the nest of earwigs from the floor of the attic. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Bedroom =-
You arrive in a bedroom. An ordinary kind of place. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You see a box. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The box contains a burger, so there's that.

There is a closed gateway leading east. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a TextWorld game. The current room is a bedroom with a box containing a burger and a closed gateway leading east. The user tried to go east but was told they need to open the gateway first.

The user is asking if they're making the right actions and if they're close to the goal. The original goal was to open the gateway, move east, open the portal, go south, ensure the passageway is open, move east again, pick up the earwig nest from the attic, and then stop.

So far, the user has tried to go east but failed because the gateway is closed. The next logical step is to open the gateway. The game might have a command like "open gateway" or something similar. Since the user was told to "ensure that the gateway is open" as the first step, the correct action here is to open it.

The user's next action should be to open the gateway. Then, after that's done, they can try going east again. So the answer is "open gateway".

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game, and they've been following the instructions to open the gateway, which they did. Now, the next step according to the initial instructions was to "make an effort to move east" after opening the gateway. So, since the gateway is open, moving east should be possible now.

The user's current location is the bedroom, and after opening the gateway, they need to go east. The previous action was opening the gateway, so the next logical step is to move east again. The game's environment might have changed after opening the gateway, so moving east would take them through the now-open gateway into the next area. 

The user's next action should be "go east" again. They need to follow the sequence: open the gateway, move east, then open the portal, etc. Since they've already opened the gateway, moving east is the next step. The response should just be the command "go east" without any extra text.

-= Recreation Zone =-
You find yourself in a recreation zone. A standard kind of place. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You make out a suitcase. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a locked locker close by. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a shelf. But the thing is empty.

There is a closed portal leading south. There is an open gateway leading west. There is an unguarded exit to the east.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game and has reached the Recreation Zone. The original goal was to open the gateway, move east, open the portal, go south, ensure the passageway is open, move east again, pick up the earwig nest from the attic, and then stop.

So far, the user has opened the first gateway and moved east to the Recreation Zone. The current room has a locked locker, a closed portal south, an open gateway west, and an unguarded exit east. The user's next steps should be to open the portal south, as per the original plan. But the user might be confused because the portal is locked. Wait, the original instructions said after moving east, open the portal. So in the Recreation Zone, there's a closed portal leading south. The user needs to open that. But how? The game might require using a key or some action. However, the user hasn't picked up any keys yet. Alternatively, maybe the portal can be opened by another command. But the user's previous action was moving east, so the next logical step is to open the portal. But the portal is closed. So the user needs to find a way to open it. Maybe there's a key in the suitcase or somewhere else. The suitcase is mentioned here. The user might need to check the suitcase for a key. But the original plan didn't mention that. Alternatively, maybe the portal can be opened by a command like "open portal" even if it's closed. But the game might require the user to use the correct command. The user's previous actions were "open gateway" and "go east". Now, in the Recreation Zone, the next step is to open the portal. So the correct command would be "open portal" or "open south portal". But the game might have specific commands. The user's previous action was "go east", so the next step is to open the portal. The user might need to try "open portal" here. However, the portal is closed, so maybe the user needs to find a key first. But the suitcase is in the room. The user hasn't checked it yet. So maybe the user should check the suitcase first. But the original plan said after opening the passageway, move east again. Wait, the original steps were: after opening the gateway, move east, open the portal, go south, ensure passageway is open, move east, pick up earwig nest. So in the Recreation Zone, the user is at the portal south. So the next step is to open the portal. The user might need to use the "open" command on the portal. So the next action should be "open portal".

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game, and they've been following the steps given. The original goal was to ensure the gateway is open, move east, open the portal, go south, make sure the passageway is open, go east again, pick up the earwigs from the attic, and then stop.

So far, they've opened the gateway in the bedroom, went east to the recreation zone, opened the portal there, and now they're in the recreation zone. The next step according to the initial instructions was after opening the portal, try to take a trip south. The user just opened the portal, so the next logical step would be to go south. 

Looking at the current location, the recreation zone has a closed portal south, which they just opened. The available exits are east (unguarded), west (open gateway), and south (now open). So the correct action here is to go south. The user's next command should be "go south" to proceed towards the next part of the game. They need to check if the passageway is ajar after that, but first, moving south is the immediate next step.

-= Cubicle =-
You are in a cubicle. A standard one. The room is well lit.

You can see a safe. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You can make out a table. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is a closed passageway leading east. There is an open portal leading north. There is an open hatch leading west. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps given in the initial instructions. They started by opening the gateway, then moving east, opening the portal, going south, and now they're in the Cubicle. The next step according to the original plan was to make sure the passageway is open. The current room has a closed passageway leading east, so the next logical action would be to open that passageway. The user has been carefully following each step, so it makes sense to continue with that. The command should be "open passageway".

-= Attic =-
You've stumbled into an usual room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be usual. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the attic.

You make out a workbench. The workbench is typical. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is an open passageway leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

There is a nest of earwigs on the floor.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps given in the initial instructions. The goal was to open the gateway, move east, open the portal, go south, open the passageway, move east again, and then pick up the nest of earwigs from the attic.

So far, the user has successfully opened the gateway, gone east, opened the portal, went south, opened the passageway, and moved east again to reach the attic. Now, in the attic, there's a nest of earwigs on the floor. The next step according to the original plan is to pick up that nest.

The current room is the attic, and the user's last action was "go east", which led them here. The next logical step is to pick up the nest of earwigs. The command should be "take nest of earwigs" or something similar. But looking at the previous actions, the user has been using commands like "open gateway", "go east", "open portal", etc. The game's response here mentions the nest is on the floor, so the correct action would be to take it. The user needs to execute that command now.
