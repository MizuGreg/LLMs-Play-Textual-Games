Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First thing I need you to do is to move west. Once you get through with that, take a trip west. Next, go to the north. And then, make an attempt to take a trip east. If you can manage that, pick up the telephone from the floor of the cubicle. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Bedroom =-
You've just sauntered into a bedroom. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.



There is an open door leading north. There is an open gate leading west.

There is a keycard on the floor.
