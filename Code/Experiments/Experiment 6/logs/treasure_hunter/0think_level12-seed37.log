Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to try to go north. After that, go to the east. If you can manage that, retrieve the telephone from the floor of the cubicle. Got that? Good!

-= Laundry Place =-
You've just sauntered into a laundry place.



There is an open portal leading east. There is an unblocked exit to the north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

-= Workshop =-
You find yourself in a workshop. An usual one.



There is an unblocked exit to the east. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

-= Cubicle =-
You've entered a cubicle. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You make out a closed safe. You can make out a desk. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset.

There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

There is a telephone on the floor.

That's not a verb I recognise.
