Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an life changing round of TextWorld? You do! First thing I need you to do is to open the portal within the scullery. After that, go north. With that done, make an effort to go west. Next, ensure that the passageway is open. Then, go to the west. If you can finish that, retrieve the shadfly from the floor of the spare room. And once you've done that, you win!
