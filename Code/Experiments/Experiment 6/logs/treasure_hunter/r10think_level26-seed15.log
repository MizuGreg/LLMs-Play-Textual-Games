-= Studio =-
Look around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a studio. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You can make out a stand. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is an open passageway leading north. There is an open hatch leading west.

-= Playroom =-
You arrive in a playroom. A normal kind of place.

You can make out a couch. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open hatch leading east. There is an open door leading west.

-= Kitchenette =-
You find yourself in a kitchenette. The room is well lit.

You can make out a chair. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is an open door leading east. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

-= Lounge =-
You find yourself in a lounge. A normal kind of place. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?



You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Pantry =-
This might come as a shock to you, but you've just walked into a pantry. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You make out a shelf. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the shelf.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

-= Cookhouse =-
You are in a cookhouse. An usual kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

You can see a pan. The pan is normal. But there isn't a thing on it.

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game and has been following a series of directions to move through different rooms. The goal mentioned in the initial prompt was to pick up a loaf of bread from the dish-pit. So far, the player has moved through the Studio, Playroom, Kitchenette, Lounge, Pantry, and Cookhouse. Each time, they've been told to go in a particular direction, and they've followed those commands.

Now, the current location is the Cookhouse. The description mentions a pan but nothing on it. The exits are north, south, and west. The user is asking if they're on the right track and if they're close to the goal. 

Looking at the path taken: Studio (west) → Playroom (west) → Kitchenette (north) → Lounge (west) → Pantry (north) → Cookhouse (north). The next steps would be to check the other directions from the Cookhouse. The user needs to find the dish-pit where the bread is. Since the Cookhouse is a kitchen-related area, maybe the dish-pit is in the south or west direction from here. 

The previous rooms included a kitchenette, pantry, and cookhouse. The dish-pit might be in the south or west. The user has already tried going north from the pantry to the cookhouse. From the cookhouse, the exits are north (unblocked), south (unblocked), and west (unblocked). So the next logical step would be to try going south or west from the cookhouse. 

The user's next action should be to go south or west. Since the original directions mentioned going south after some steps, maybe the dish-pit is in the south direction. But the user needs to check. The answer should be to go south from the Cookhouse. However, the user's previous steps included going west, so maybe the dish-pit is in the west. But the user hasn't checked that yet. 

Alternatively, maybe the dish-pit is in the south direction. The user should try going south from the Cookhouse. So the next command would be "go south".

-= Bedchamber =-
You arrive in a bedchamber. A typical one. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a bookshelf. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a bar. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

-= Washroom =-
You arrive in a washroom. An usual kind of place. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You can see a bench. On the bench you can make out a latchkey.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.



>                                                                                                                                -= Washroom =-0/9
