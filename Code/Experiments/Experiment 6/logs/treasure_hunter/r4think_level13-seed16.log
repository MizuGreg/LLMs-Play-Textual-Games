It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First of all, you could, like, make an attempt to head west. And then, go north. With that accomplished, move west. Then, pick-up the peanut from the floor of the studio. Alright, thanks!

-= Kitchenette =-
Well, here we are in a kitchenette.



There is an open portal leading north. There is an open passageway leading west.

-= Cubicle =-
Guess what, you are in the place we're calling the cubicle. You begin looking for stuff.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a safe. You can see a closed locker. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a desk. But the thing is empty.

There is an open passageway leading east. There is an open gateway leading north. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

-= Steam Room =-
Well how about that, you are in a place we're calling a steam room. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.



There is an open gateway leading south. There is an open door leading west.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me think through this. The user is in a text-based game called TextWorld. They've been moving through different rooms: started in the Kitchenette, went west to the Cubicle, then north to the Steam Room. The goal is to reach the original goal, which isn't explicitly stated, but usually in these games, it's something like finding an exit, a key, or completing a task.

In the Steam Room, the user can go south or west. The previous steps involved exploring and interacting with objects. In the Cubicle, there was a safe, a locker, and a desk. The Steam Room is a new area. The user might need to check if there's something valuable here or a clue to the next step. Since the Steam Room has a south and west exit, maybe there's an item in this room that's needed. But the description doesn't mention any items here. The user might need to check the west exit, which could lead back to the Cubicle or another area. Alternatively, going south back to the Kitchenette. But the user is asking if they're close to the goal. Since they've explored different areas, maybe they need to collect items from the Cubicle's safe or locker. However, the Steam Room doesn't have any items mentioned. The next logical step might be to check the west exit, which is unguarded, so maybe that's a path to another room with the goal. Alternatively, maybe the Steam Room has a hidden item. But the description doesn't say. The user's next action should be to explore further. Since the Steam Room has a west door, going west might be the next step. Alternatively, going south back to the Kitchenette. But the user is asking if they're close. Since they've explored multiple rooms, maybe they're on the right track. The next action should be to go west or south. The user's previous actions were go west, then north. Now in Steam Room, the options are south or west. The user might need to check both. But the user is asking for the next command. The assistant should respond with the next action. Since the user is in the Steam Room, and the options are south or west, the next step could be to go west. Alternatively, maybe the user should check the south exit. But the user is asking if they're close. Since the Steam Room is a new area, maybe there's something here. But the description doesn't mention items. So perhaps the next step is to go west. The user's previous steps were moving through the rooms, so continuing that pattern, going west from the Steam Room would be logical. So the next command is go west.

-= Studio =-
You arrive in a studio. A standard one.



There is an open door leading east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked.

There is a peanut on the floor.
