Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First thing I need you to do is to try to venture west. And then, go south. Then, head south. After that, venture west. That done, travel south. And then, take a trip east. And then, try to go to the east. Then, take a trip north. With that over with, pick up the durian from the floor of the shower. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Basement =-
I am sorry to announce that you are now in the basement. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a coffer. You see a rack. The rack appears to be empty. You can make out a stand. The stand is usual. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Scullery =-
If you're wondering why everything seems so ordinary all of a sudden, it's because you've just walked into the scullery. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You make out a case. The case is empty! What a waste of a day! Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. You move on, clearly depressed by TextWorld.

There is an open door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.
