Welcome to TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First thing I need you to do is to make an effort to head north. Following that, make an attempt to take a trip east. That done, venture north. Following that, travel east. And then, try to take a trip north. And then, go to the east. Once you do that, pick up the keycard from the floor of the bathroom. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Scullery =-
You are in a scullery. An usual kind of place. You start to take note of what's in the room.

What's that over there? It looks like it's a pan. The pan is usual. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a platter. But there isn't a thing on it. You can see a board. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

-= Chamber =-
Look at you, bigshot, walking into a chamber like it isn't some huge deal.

You make out a bar. The bar is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the bar. You can see a bed stand! The bed stand is ordinary. On the bed stand you see a textbook, so there's that.
