Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an fast paced round of TextWorld? You do! Here is how to play! First of all, you could, like, head east. Then, go to the south. Next, go to the east. With that done, go north. After that, make an attempt to go to the north. With that done, head west. And then, retrieve the loaf of bread from the floor of the study. Got that? Good!
