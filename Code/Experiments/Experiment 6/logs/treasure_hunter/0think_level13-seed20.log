I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is how to play! First step, take a trip west. And then, head north. That done, venture north. And then, lift the loaf of bread from the floor of the launderette. Alright, thanks!

-= Chamber =-
You've just sauntered into a chamber.

You can see a desk. The desk is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open portal leading north. There is an open gate leading south. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.
