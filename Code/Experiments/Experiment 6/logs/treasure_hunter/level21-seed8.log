Welcome to TextWorld! First, it would be good if you could take a trip west. If you can accomplish that, try to move south. Then, retrieve the spork from the floor of the cookery. That's it!

-= Cubicle =-
You are in a cubicle. A normal kind of place.

You can make out a coffer. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. What's that over there? It looks like it's a desk. The desk is normal. However, the desk, like an empty desk, has nothing on it.

There is an open gate leading north. There is an open portal leading west. There is an unguarded exit to the east. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

-= Study =-
You're now in the study.

You make out a closed toolbox in the corner. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a locker. You see a mantle. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's an armchair. The armchair is normal. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open portal leading east. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing TextWorld and has already gone west from the cubicle into the study. The current location is the study. The study has a closed toolbox in the corner, a mantle with nothing on it, an armchair that's been emptied, an open portal east, and an exit to the south.

The original goal mentioned in the welcome message was to first go west, then south, then retrieve the spork from the cookery area. The user has already completed the first two steps: going west (to the study) and then probably trying to go south next. But the current location is the study, and the exit to the south is unguarded. So the next logical step would be to go south from the study. 

The user is asking if they're making the right actions and if they're close to the goal. Since they've gone west and are now in the study, the next step should be to go south as per the initial instructions. The spork is in the cookery area, which might be accessible after moving south from the study. So the correct next action is to go south.
</think>go south

-= Cookery =-
You find yourself in a cookery. A typical kind of place.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked.

There is a spork on the floor.

Okay, let's see. The user has been moving through different rooms in the TextWorld game. The original goal was to retrieve the spork from the cookery. Let me recap the steps so far.

First, they started in the cubicle, went west to the study. Then from the study, they went south to the cookery. In the cookery, there's a spork on the floor. So the next logical step is to pick up the spork. The user is asking if they're on the right track and if they're close to the goal. Since the spork is in the cookery, and they're already there, the next action should be to take the spork. The command would be "take spork" or "get spork". But in TextWorld, the exact command might vary. Looking at the previous interactions, when they were in the cookery, the spork is on the floor. So the correct command here is to pick it up. The user needs to take the spork to complete the goal. So the next action is to take the spork.
</think>take spork
