I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! First step, move south. And then, venture east. And then, move east. That done, make an attempt to travel east. Then, pick up the candy bar from the floor of the laundry place. Got that? Good!

-= Spare Room =-
Ah, the spare room. This is some kind of spare room, really great ordinary vibes in this place, a wonderful ordinary atmosphere. And now, well, you're in it. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You make out an opened crate nearby. The crate is empty! What a waste of a day! An open chest, which looks normal, is here. What a letdown! The chest is empty! You make out a shelf! The shelf is usual. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is an unblocked exit to the east. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

-= Canteen =-
I just think it's great that you've just entered a canteen.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user has been moving through different rooms in TextWorld. They started in the Spare Room, went south to the Canteen. Now, they're in the Canteen, and the description mentions exits to the north, east, and west. The user's previous action was "go south" from the Spare Room to get here.

The user is asking if they're making the right actions and if they're close to the goal. The original instructions mentioned moving south, then east twice, then picking up a candy bar from the laundry place. But the current room is the Canteen, which might not be the laundry place. The laundry place was mentioned earlier in the Spare Room description, but the user hasn't picked up the candy bar yet.

So, the next step would be to follow the initial plan: after moving south to the Canteen, the next steps were to go east twice. But in the Canteen, the exits are north, east, west. The user's next action should be to go east. Then, from there, maybe another east, and then check the laundry place. But the user is asking if they're on the right track. Since the initial plan was to go east twice from the Canteen, the correct next move is east. The user needs to continue moving east to reach the laundry place where the candy bar is. So the next command should be "go east".

-= Cookery =-
You arrive in a cookery. An usual kind of place.

Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a freezer. Now why would someone leave that there? You can make out a fridge. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a platter. The platter is standard. The platter appears to be empty.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Okay, let's see. The user has been moving through different rooms in TextWorld. The original instructions were to go south, then east twice, pick up the candy bar from the laundry place. But so far, they've gone south into the Spare Room, then east into the Canteen, then east again into the Cookery.

In the Cookery, there's a freezer, a fridge, and a secret platter. The user is supposed to pick up the candy bar from the laundry place. But the current location is the Cookery. The next step would be to check if the laundry place is nearby. The user might need to explore east again from the Cookery. The exit to the west is unguarded, but the user was told to go east twice from the Spare Room. Maybe the laundry place is in the east direction from the Cookery. So the next action should be to go east again. But wait, in the Cookery description, the exit to the east is unguarded. So going east from Cookery might lead to the next room. The user needs to check if the laundry place is there. Alternatively, maybe the candy bar is in the platter, but the platter is empty. Hmm. The original plan was to go east twice from the Spare Room, then pick up the candy bar. But the user is now in the Cookery. Maybe the laundry place is in a different direction. Wait, the initial instructions said to go south, then east, then east, then try to go east again, then pick up the candy bar from the laundry place. So after the two easts from the Spare Room, they should be in the Canteen, then east again to Cookery. Maybe the laundry place is another room. But the user hasn't found it yet. The next step would be to check the east direction again from Cookery. So the next action is go east.

-= Dish-Pit =-
Of every dish-pit you could have sauntered into, you had to saunter into a normal one. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You scan the room for a cabinet, and you find a cabinet. The cabinet is empty, what a horrible day!

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user has been moving through different rooms in the game: Spare Room, Canteen, Cookery, and now Dish-Pit. Each time, they've been going east or following the directions given. The original goal mentioned was to pick up the candy bar from the laundry place, but so far, the user hasn't found any candy bars.

In the Spare Room, there was an empty crate, chest, and shelf. The Canteen had a freezer and fridge, but nothing notable. The Cookery had a platter that was empty after pressing a button. The Dish-Pit has a cabinet that's empty. So far, no candy bar has been found. The user is following the path of going east and north, but maybe they need to check other directions or look more carefully.

The current room is Dish-Pit. The possible exits are east, north, west. The user's next action should be to check these directions. Since the previous moves were east, maybe trying north or west could lead to another area. Alternatively, maybe the candy bar is in a different room that's accessible through another path. But the user hasn't explored south yet, which was the first move. However, the original instruction said to go south, then east, then east again, then try east again, then pick up the candy bar. Maybe the candy bar is in the laundry place, which might be a different room. But the user hasn't reached that yet.

Wait, the initial instructions said after moving east twice, then try east again, then pick up the candy bar from the laundry place. So maybe the laundry place is a room that's accessible through the current path. But the user is in Dish-Pit now. Maybe they need to go west or north to find the laundry place. Alternatively, maybe the candy bar is in the cookery or canteen. But the user hasn't checked those areas thoroughly. However, the game's description so far hasn't mentioned a laundry place except in the initial instructions. So perhaps the user needs to continue exploring the current room's exits. The next step would be to go north or west. Since the user has been going east, maybe trying north now. But the user's last action was going east again. The current room's exits are east, north, west. So the next action could be north or west. The user might need to check all possible directions to find the laundry place. Alternatively, maybe the candy bar is in the freezer or fridge in the cookery. But the user hasn't checked there yet. However, the user's previous action was going east from the cookery to the dish-pit. So maybe the next step is to go west from the dish-pit back to the cookery and check the fridge or freezer again. But the user hasn't done that yet. Alternatively, maybe the laundry place is in the canteen or spare room. But the user hasn't found it yet. The user needs to continue exploring. The next action should be to go north or west. Since the user is in the dish-pit, going north might lead to another room. The user's next command should be "go north" or "go west". Given the previous pattern of moving east, maybe the next step is to go north. But the user needs to check the possible directions. The correct next action is to go north.
</think>go north

-= Restroom =-
You arrive in a restroom. An ordinary kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.



>                                                                                                                                -= Restroom =-0/5

Okay, let's see. The user has been moving through different rooms in the TextWorld game. The initial instructions were to go south, then east twice, pick up the candy bar from the laundry place. But so far, the user has gone south from the spare room into the canteen, then east to cookery, east again to dish-pit, then north to restroom. Now, in the restroom, the prompts mention exits to east, north, and south. The user is supposed to check if they're on the right track and decide the next move.

Hmm, the original goal was to pick up the candy bar from the laundry place. The user hasn't done that yet. The current room is the restroom. The exits here are east, north, south. The previous rooms were spare room, canteen, cookery, dish-pit, now restroom. Maybe the laundry place is in one of these rooms? Wait, the first instruction mentioned the laundry place. Let me check the initial description again.

In the spare room, the user was told to pick up the candy bar from the laundry place. But in the spare room description, there's an opened crate, an open chest, a shelf, and exits. The laundry place might be a different room. Wait, maybe the user hasn't found the laundry place yet. The current room is the restroom. So perhaps the next step is to check the exits from the restroom to see if any lead to the laundry place. The exits are east, north, south. The user might need to try going south from the restroom, as the prompt says "there is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked." So maybe going south from the restroom would take them back to the dish-pit or another room. But the original goal is to get the candy bar from the laundry place. Maybe the laundry place is in the dish-pit or another room. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check the rooms they've already visited for the candy bar. Wait, in the spare room, the user was told to pick up the candy bar from the laundry place, but in the spare room description, there's nothing mentioned about a candy bar. So perhaps the laundry place is a different room. The user might need to continue exploring. Since the current room is the restroom, the next logical step might be to go south, as that's the exit mentioned. Alternatively, maybe the user should check the other exits. But the user's previous actions have been to go east, so maybe continuing east from the restroom? But the restroom's east exit is unblocked. However, the user needs to find the laundry place where the candy bar is. Since the user hasn't found it yet, they need to keep exploring. The next action would be to go south from the restroom, as that's the exit mentioned. So the answer is go south.

Okay, let's see. The user has been moving through different rooms in the TextWorld game. The initial instructions were to go south, then east twice, pick up the candy bar from the laundry place. But so far, the user has ended up in the Dish-Pit again after going south from the Restroom.

The current room is Dish-Pit again. The description mentions a cabinet that's empty. The user has been moving between rooms, but hasn't picked up the candy bar yet. The original goal was to pick up the candy bar from the laundry place. However, the user hasn't found it yet. 

In the Spare Room, there was an opened crate and a chest, but they were empty. The Canteen, Cookery, and Restroom have been explored, but no candy bar. The Dish-Pit is mentioned again here. Maybe the candy bar is in a different room. Wait, the user was supposed to go east from the laundry place. But the current path seems to be looping between Dish-Pit and Restroom. 

The user's next action should be to check the cabinet in the Dish-Pit, but the cabinet is empty. Alternatively, maybe the candy bar is in another room. But according to the previous steps, the user hasn't reached the laundry place yet. Maybe the laundry place is another room that needs to be explored. However, the current path is leading back to Dish-Pit. 

The user needs to find the laundry place. Maybe the correct path is to go east from the Restroom, but the Restroom's exits are east, north, and south. Wait, in the Restroom, the user was told to go south, which led back to Dish-Pit. Maybe the laundry place is in a different direction. Alternatively, perhaps the candy bar is in the Cookery room? But the Cookery had a freezer and a fridge, but nothing mentioned about a candy bar. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check the cabinet in the Dish-Pit again, but it's empty. The user might need to explore other rooms. Since the user is in Dish-Pit again, the next step could be to check the cabinet again, but it's empty. Alternatively, try going east, north, or west from here. The user has been going back and forth. Maybe the correct path is to go east from the Dish-Pit. Let me check the previous steps. 

In the Dish-Pit, the exits are east, north, west. The user was in Dish-Pit, went south to Restroom, then back to Dish-Pit. So maybe the next step is to go east from Dish-Pit. But the user's last action was go south, leading back to Dish-Pit. So the next action should be to go east, north, or west. The user needs to find the laundry place. Maybe the laundry place is in the north direction from Dish-Pit. Let's assume that the user should try going north from Dish-Pit. But the user's previous action was go south, so maybe the next action is go north. However, the user's goal is to pick up the candy bar from the laundry place. So perhaps the user needs to find the laundry place and then pick up the candy bar. But the current path isn't leading there. Maybe the user needs to explore other directions. 

Alternatively, maybe the user should check the cabinet again, but it's empty. The user might need to look for other objects. But according to the description, the cabinet is empty. So perhaps the next step is to go east from Dish-Pit. Let's go with that.

Okay, let me think through this. The user is in a text-based game where they've been moving through different rooms. The original instruction was to pick up the candy bar from the laundry place. The user just arrived at the Laundry Place, and the description mentions a candy bar on the floor. So the next logical step is to pick it up. The previous actions involved moving through rooms, and now that the candy bar is in view, the correct command would be to take it. I need to make sure I only output the command, no extra text. So the answer should be "take candy bar".
