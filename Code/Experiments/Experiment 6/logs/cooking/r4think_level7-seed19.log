-= Bedroom =-
You've just shown up in a bedroom. The room is well lit.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a bed. The bed is large. The bed appears to be empty.

There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.

You are in a bathroom. An usual kind of place.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a toilet. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The toilet is white. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is an exit to the south.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they've navigated through a bedroom, corridor, and now a bathroom. The goal is to cook a meal using the cookbook in the kitchen. So far, they've moved west from the bedroom to the corridor, then north to the bathroom. The current location is the bathroom, which has an exit to the south.

The user is asking if they're on the right track and close to the goal. The previous locations were bedroom (with a secret button revealing a bed), corridor (with multiple exits), and now the bathroom (with a secret button revealing a toilet). The cookbook is in the kitchen, so the next logical step would be to find the kitchen. However, the current exit is south from the bathroom. But the bathroom's exit is south, which might lead back to the corridor or another area. Wait, the corridor had exits to east, north, south, west. The bathroom is connected to the south. So maybe going south from the bathroom would take them back to the corridor? But the corridor's exit to the west was the previous path. Alternatively, maybe the bathroom is connected to another area. But the user hasn't found the kitchen yet.

The user needs to reach the kitchen to check the cookbook. So from the bathroom, the exit to the south might lead to another area. But the current room is the bathroom, and the exit is south. The user's next action should be to go south from the bathroom. But the user is asking if they're close. Since the bathroom is part of the house, maybe the kitchen is nearby. But the path isn't clear yet. The user has to proceed through the exits. The previous exits were west from bedroom, north from corridor, and south from bathroom. So maybe the next step is to go south from the bathroom, then check the corridor again, and look for other exits. Alternatively, maybe the kitchen is in a different direction. But based on the current information, the next action should be to go south from the bathroom. However, the user is asking if they're close. Since they've been moving through different rooms, maybe they're on the right track. The next step is to go south from the bathroom.

Well, here we are in the kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You make out a closed fridge. You see a closed oven, which looks conventional, nearby. You see a table. On the table you see a knife. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You see a counter. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a counter? On the counter you can see a raw purple potato, a green apple, a yellow apple and a cookbook. You make out a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is a closed plain door leading west. There is an exit to the east.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the kitchen, which is the target location since the goal is to cook a meal using the cookbook. They found the cookbook on the table, but it's closed. The user tried to open it, but it wasn't possible. Now they need to figure out how to proceed.

First, the cookbook is in the kitchen, so maybe the next step is to look for ingredients or tools to make a meal. The kitchen has a fridge, oven, stove, counter with potatoes, apples, and the cookbook. The user needs to find a way to use the cookbook. Since the cookbook is closed, perhaps they need to find a way to open it. But the user already tried opening it and it didn't work. Maybe the cookbook is a book that needs to be read, but in the game's context, maybe they need to find a way to access the recipe.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the ingredients on the counter. The raw potato and apples could be part of a recipe. The oven and stove are available for cooking. The user might need to use the oven or stove to cook the ingredients. But the cookbook is closed, so maybe the user needs to find a way to open it first. However, the game said it's not something you can open. So maybe the cookbook is already accessible, and the user needs to use it to find a recipe.

Wait, the user is supposed to cook a meal, so maybe the next step is to use the ingredients and the oven or stove. The cookbook might have the recipe, but since it's closed, perhaps the user needs to find a way to use it. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to look for a way to access the recipe without opening the book. But the game's previous response said it's not something you can open. So maybe the user needs to use the ingredients and the kitchen appliances to cook.

The user is in the kitchen, so the next logical step is to use the ingredients. The raw potato and apples are on the counter. The user could try to cook them using the stove or oven. The cookbook might have the recipe, but since it's closed, maybe the user needs to find the recipe through another means. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to find a way to open the cookbook. But the game said it's not something you can open. So perhaps the user needs to proceed with the ingredients.

The user's goal is to cook a meal, so the next action should be to use the ingredients. The user could take the potato and apple and use the stove or oven. The stove is empty, but maybe the user can cook something there. The oven is closed, so maybe the user needs to open it. But the user hasn't tried that yet. Alternatively, the user could try to use the ingredients directly.

But the user is stuck because the cookbook is closed. Maybe the user needs to find a way to open it. However, the game said it's not something you can open. So maybe the user needs to look for another way. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the ingredients and the kitchen appliances to cook, even without the cookbook. But the original instruction was to check the cookbook for the recipe. So perhaps the user needs to find a way to open the cookbook. But the game says it's not possible. Maybe the user needs to find a different approach.

Wait, the user is in the kitchen, and the cookbook is on the table. Maybe the user needs to read the cookbook, but it's closed. So perhaps the user needs to find a way to open it. But the game says it's not something you can open. So maybe the user needs to use the ingredients and the stove to cook. The user could take the potato and apple and start cooking. The next action would be to use the stove or oven. The user could try to cook the potato and apple. So the next step is to use the stove or oven. The user could try to cook the potato. The stove is empty, so maybe the user can put the potato on it. The next action would be to cook the potato.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the kitchen, trying to cook a meal. They found the cookbook, but it's closed. Then they tried to cook a potato but were asked what to cook it with. They tried using an apple, but the game said they can't see any such thing. So maybe the apple isn't available anymore or isn't usable here.

The user needs to figure out how to proceed. The original goal was to cook a delicious meal using the cookbook. Since the cookbook is closed, maybe they need to find a way to open it. But the game said it's not something you can open. Alternatively, maybe the ingredients on the counter are the key. There's a raw purple potato, green apple, yellow apple, and the cookbook. The user has the apples, but maybe they need to use them in a different way.

Wait, the user tried to cook the potato with an apple but it wasn't possible. Maybe the apples are already on the counter, so they can be used as ingredients. Perhaps the user needs to use the apples and potato together. But the game didn't allow using the apple as a cooking tool. Maybe the user needs to find another approach. The stove is there, so maybe they can cook the potato directly without using the apple. Or maybe the apple is a tool to use with the stove. But the game said they can't see any such thing.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to find the recipe in the cookbook even though it's closed. But the game said it's not something you can open. So perhaps the user needs to use the ingredients available. The potato and apples are there. The user could try to cook the potato and apple together. But the game didn't allow using the apple. Maybe the user needs to try another ingredient. The cookbook might have a recipe that uses the potato and apples, but the user needs to find a way to access it.

Since the user is stuck, maybe the next step is to look for another way to use the ingredients. The stove is empty, so maybe the user can put the potato on it. The next action would be to cook the potato. But the game asked what to cook it with, so maybe the user needs to use the apple as a tool. But the game said it's not possible. So perhaps the user needs to try another approach. Maybe the user needs to find a way to open the cookbook. But the game said it's not possible.

Okay, the user is trying to cook a meal in the kitchen. They've taken the purple potato and tried to cook it with the green apple, but the game says cooking requires a source of heat. The kitchen has a stove and an oven, which are sources of heat. The user needs to use one of these appliances.

The user probably needs to put the potato on the stove or oven. Since the stove is mentioned as conventional but empty, maybe they can use that. The next step is to use the stove to cook the potato. The command should be to cook the potato using the stove. But the game might expect a specific command format. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to open the oven first. But the oven is closed, so they might need to open it. However, the user hasn't tried that yet. The previous attempt was to cook with the apple, which didn't work.

Okay, the user is in the kitchen and has been trying to cook a meal. They previously tried to cook a potato but encountered issues. Now, they're trying to use the cookbook, but the game doesn't recognize "use" as a verb. The cookbook is on the counter, so maybe the correct action is to open it. But earlier, the user tried opening it and it wasn't possible. Wait, the game said "It isn't something you can open." So maybe the cookbook is already accessible, and the user needs to read it. But the command "read cookbook" might not be valid. Alternatively, the user might need to find a way to access the recipe without opening it. Since the user is close to the goal, the next step might be to use the ingredients available. The apples and the stove are there. The user could try to make a dish with the apples and the potato. But the game requires specific commands. The previous action was "use cookbook," which isn't valid. Maybe the correct command is "open cookbook," but the game said it's not possible. So the user might need to proceed without the cookbook, using the available ingredients. The next action could be to cook the apples on the stove. The user has the green and yellow apples. So the command would be "cook apple on stove." But the game might expect a different format. Alternatively, the user might need to take the apple first.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, the user has successfully fried the green apple on the stove. Now, they need to enjoy their meal. The original goal was to cook a delicious meal using the cookbook. Even though the cookbook was closed, the user managed to cook the apple using the available resources. The next step is to enjoy the meal, which is the final action. The game might expect the command "enjoy meal" or something similar. Since the user previously tried "enjoy meal" and it was rejected, maybe the correct command is "eat meal" or "consume meal". But the game's previous response didn't accept "enjoy", so the user needs to try another verb. The available options are limited, and the user has already cooked the apple. The next logical step is to eat the cooked apple as the meal. So the command would be "eat fried green apple" or similar. But the game might require a simpler command. Since the user is in the kitchen and has cooked the apple, the final action is to enjoy the meal. The correct command is likely "enjoy meal" even if it was rejected before, but the user has to try again.

Okay, the user has cooked the green apple on the stove and eaten it. The game's last response was "meal is ready," which isn't a verb. The user needs to confirm that the meal is prepared. Since the game accepts "enjoy meal" before but rejected it, maybe the correct command is "finish meal" or "consume meal." However, the user has already eaten the apple, so the next step is to acknowledge completion. The original goal was to cook a meal, which the user has done. The correct action is to say "meal is prepared" or "meal completed." But the game says "That's not a verb I recognise." So maybe the user needs to use a verb like "finish" or "end." The correct command would be "finish meal" or "end meal." But the game might expect "meal is ready" as the final step. However, the user has already eaten the meal. So the next action is to confirm completion, even if the game doesn't recognize it. The user has achieved the goal, so the answer is to say "meal is prepared" even if it's not a verb. The game might accept it as the final command.

Okay, the user has been trying to finish the meal in the game, but every time they try to use a command like "enjoy meal" or "eat meal", the game rejects it. The user has already cooked the green apple and eaten it, so the meal is done. The game's previous responses indicate that it's not accepting any of the expected verbs. Since the user is stuck, maybe the correct action is to just say "done" or "finish" even if it's not a verb. Alternatively, the user might need to exit the kitchen or go back to the previous room. But the goal was to cook the meal, which they have done. The game might be expecting a specific command that's not being recognized. Since all other options are exhausted, the user might have to proceed with the only remaining action, which is to exit the kitchen. The next step is to go west through the door leading back to the corridor. But the user's goal is to enjoy the meal, so maybe the correct command is to "enjoy" even if it's not recognized. However, the game says "That's not a verb I recognise." So the user has to find another way. The only remaining option is to exit the kitchen, so the command is "go west".

Okay, the user has been through the kitchen, pantry, and back to the kitchen. They've cooked the green apple and eaten it, but the game is still expecting them to reach the original goal of cooking a meal. The pantry was empty, but the kitchen has the cookbook and other ingredients. The user might need to use the cookbook again, but it's closed. Since they already cooked the apple, maybe the meal is considered done. The game might accept "meal is ready" as the final command, even if it's not a verb. Alternatively, the user needs to exit the kitchen again. But the goal was to cook, which they did. The correct action is to confirm the meal is prepared, so the command is "meal is ready".

You make out a closed fridge. You see a closed oven, which looks conventional, nearby. You see a table. On the table you see a knife. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You see a counter. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a counter? On the counter you can see a yellow apple and a cookbook. You make out a stove.

You are in a pantry. It seems to be pretty standard here.

You make out a shelf. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is an open plain door leading east.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

-= Kitchen =-
Well, here we are in the kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You make out a closed fridge. You see a closed oven, which looks conventional, nearby. You see a table. On the table you see a knife. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You see a counter. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a counter? On the counter you can see a yellow apple and a cookbook. You make out a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is an open plain door leading west. There is an exit to the east.
