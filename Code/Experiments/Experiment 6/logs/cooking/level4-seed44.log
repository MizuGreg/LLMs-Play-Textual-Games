You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Bedroom =-
You find yourself in a bedroom. An usual kind of place.

Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a bed. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well

You need an exit without a door? You should try going east.

-= Corridor =-
You're now in the corridor. You begin to take stock of what's here.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one. There is an exit to the west.

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.

You see a fridge. The fridge contains a yellow onion, a raw yellow potato, a red onion and a raw red tuna. Wow, check out the price tag that the fridge's owner still hasn't taken off! A hundred dollars! You can make out a closed oven close by. You can see a table. You shudder, but continue examining the table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You scan the room for a counter, and you find a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a red apple. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is an open frosted-glass door leading east. There is an exit to the south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

You are in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.

You see a fridge. The fridge contains a raw yellow potato and a raw red tuna. Wow, check out the price tag that the fridge's owner still hasn't taken off! A hundred dollars! You can make out a closed oven close by. You can see a table. You shudder, but continue examining the table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You scan the room for a counter, and you find a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a red apple. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is an open frosted-glass door leading east. There is an exit to the south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

There is a red onion on the floor.
