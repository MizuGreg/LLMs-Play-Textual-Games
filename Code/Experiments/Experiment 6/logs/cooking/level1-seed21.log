You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
Well, here we are in a kitchen.

Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a fridge. The fridge is empty! What a waste of a day! You can make out a closed conventional looking oven in the room. Were you looking for a table? Because look over there, it's a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You can see a counter. On the counter you can make out a green hot pepper, a green bell pepper, a red bell pepper, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a yellow apple and a knife. You make out a stove. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.
