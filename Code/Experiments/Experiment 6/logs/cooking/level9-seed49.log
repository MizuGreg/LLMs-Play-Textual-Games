You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Bedroom =-
You are in a bedroom. A normal one.

As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a bed. What a great pairing of adjectives and nouns! But there isn't a thing on it. Sometimes, just sometimes, TextWorld can just be the worst.

You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one. There is an exit to the south.

It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.
