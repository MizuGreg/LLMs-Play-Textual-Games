You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
Well, here we are in a kitchen.

You make out a fridge. The fridge contains a raw white tuna, a green bell pepper and a yellow onion. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's an oven. Now that's what I call TextWorld! What's that over there? It looks like it's a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. Hey, want to see a counter? Look over there, a counter! The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a green hot pepper and a cookbook. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe in the cookbook. The recipe says to slice the yellow potato, fry it, and then prepare the meal. So far, they've taken the cookbook, looked at the ingredients, and tried to slice the yellow potato. But they got stuck because they needed a knife.

Wait, the knife is on the table. The user hasn't picked it up yet. So the next logical step would be to take the knife first. Then, with the knife, they can slice the potato. Once sliced, they can fry it using the stove. Then follow the directions to prepare the meal. The user might not have realized they need to take the knife before slicing. So the correct action now is to take the knife from the table.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to slice the yellow potato but keeps getting errors. The previous attempt was to slice the potato with the knife, but the system said that's not a verb. Then they tried using the knife on the potato, which also didn't work. The error message says they need to take the yellow potato first.

Wait, maybe the user hasn't taken the potato yet. Let me check the inventory. The user has the cookbook and the knife. The potato is on the counter. So the first step is to take the yellow potato. Then, with the knife, they can slice it. So the correct action now is to take the yellow potato from the counter.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to fry the yellow potato using the stove. They've tried several commands like "fry yellow potato", "use stove on yellow potato", "use stove to fry yellow potato", but none worked. The error messages indicate that these aren't valid verbs.

Hmm, maybe the correct command is different. In many text games, you need to use specific verbs like "put" or "place" when using tools. Since the stove is needed to fry, perhaps the user needs to put the potato on the stove. Alternatively, maybe "cook" is the verb instead of "fry". But the recipe says "fry", so maybe the game expects a different phrasing.

Wait, the user has the knife and the potato. They sliced the potato. Now, to fry, they might need to place it on the stove. The stove is in the kitchen. So maybe the correct action is "put yellow potato on stove". Or maybe "place yellow potato on stove". Let me check previous steps. The user tried "use stove on yellow potato", which didn't work. Maybe "put" is the right verb here. Let me try that.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to fry the yellow potato. They've already sliced it and put it on the stove. The previous attempt to use "fry" didn't work. Maybe the correct verb is "cook" instead of "fry"? Or perhaps "heat"? But the recipe says "fry", so maybe the game expects a different command.

Wait, in some games, you need to use the stove's action. Like "use stove to fry". But the user tried that. Alternatively, maybe "cook" is the verb. Let me check the previous steps. The user tried "cook yellow potato on stove" but got an error. Maybe the correct command is "fry yellow potato with stove"? Or "fry the yellow potato". But the system says "That's not a verb I recognise."

Hmm, maybe the game expects "put" again. But the potato is already on the stove. Wait, maybe the user needs to use the stove's function. Like "stove fry". But that's not a standard command. Alternatively, maybe the correct action is "cook" without specifying the tool. Let me think. The user has the potato on the stove. The next step is to fry it. Since "fry" isn't working, maybe "cook" is the right verb here. Let's try that.
