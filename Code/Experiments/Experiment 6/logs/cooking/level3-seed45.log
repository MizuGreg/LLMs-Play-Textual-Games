You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You've entered a kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You can make out a fridge. The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a raw red tuna, a yellow onion, an orange bell pepper, a red bell pepper and a lettuce. You make out an oven. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You can make out a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. Look over there! a counter. You see a banana, a green apple and a raw purple potato on the counter. Wow! Just like in the movies! Were you looking for a stove? Because look over there, it's a stove. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.
