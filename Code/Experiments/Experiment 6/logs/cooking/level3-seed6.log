You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
If you're wondering why everything seems so ordinary all of a sudden, it's because you've just sauntered into the kitchen.

You can make out an opened fridge. The fridge contains a white onion, a raw pork chop, a red bell pepper and an orange bell pepper. You see a closed oven here. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a knife. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a yellow apple, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a green apple, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a yellow onion, a raw purple potato, a tomato and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal using the ingredients in the kitchen. They've checked the fridge, oven, table, and counter, but the cookbook is the only thing they haven't used yet. The cookbook is on the counter, and they tried looking in the counter but maybe didn't check the cookbook specifically.

Wait, the user initially tried to open the cookbook but was told it's not something you can open. Then they looked around, under the table, under the counter, and finally checked the counter again. The cookbook is on the counter, so maybe they need to pick it up. But the previous attempt to look in the counter didn't mention the cookbook, but the user is now at the counter again. Maybe the cookbook is there, but they need to take it. Once they have the cookbook, they can read the recipe. Then they can use the ingredients from the fridge and other places to cook. The oven is open now, so they can put the dish in there. The goal is to cook a meal, so the next step is probably to take the cookbook, read the recipe, gather ingredients, and then use the oven. Since the user is at the counter again, maybe they need to take the cookbook from the counter. Let me check the previous steps. The user looked in the counter and saw the cookbook. So the next action should be to take the cookbook. Then they can proceed to follow the recipe.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the recipe from the cookbook. The first step is to chop the red apple. But every time they try to chop it, the game says that cutting requires a knife. The user has a knife on the table, so they need to use it. The previous attempts to use the knife on the red apple resulted in errors because the user didn't use the correct phrasing. The correct command should be "chop red apple with knife" or similar. But the game might expect a specific verb. Since "chop" is the verb, and the knife is the tool, maybe the correct command is "chop red apple with knife". But the user tried "use knife on red apple" which didn't work. Alternatively, maybe "cut red apple with knife". The game's error messages suggest that "chop" is the correct verb, but the user needs to specify using the knife. So the next action should be to chop the red apple using the knife. The correct command is likely "chop red apple with knife".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the recipe step by step. They've already chopped the red and yellow apples using the knife. Now they need to dice the yellow potato. The previous step was trying to dice the yellow potato but forgot to take it first. They took the yellow potato from the counter. Now, they need to use the knife to dice it. The correct command would be "dice yellow potato with knife". But the game might expect a different phrasing. Alternatively, maybe "cut yellow potato with knife" since "dice" is a type of cutting. But according to the recipe, it's "dice the yellow potato", so the verb should be "dice". The user has the knife and the potato, so the next action is to dice the potato with the knife.

Okay, the user is trying to fry the red apple. The previous attempts to use "fry" resulted in errors. The game might expect a different verb or a specific phrasing. Since the recipe says "fry the red apple", maybe the correct command is "fry red apple with pan". But the user keeps getting "That's not a verb I recognise." Maybe "fry" isn't the right verb here. Alternatively, "cook" or "sear" might be acceptable. But according to the recipe, it's "fry". Wait, perhaps the user needs to use the stove. The stove is mentioned in the kitchen description. So maybe the correct command is "fry red apple on stove". But the user tried "with pan" before. The game might require specifying the stove instead of a pan. Let me check the previous steps. The user has the red apple and the knife. The stove is in the kitchen. So the next action should be to fry the red apple on the stove. The correct command is likely "fry red apple on stove".

Okay, the user is stuck on the "fry red apple" step. They've tried multiple variations like "fry red apple with pan", "fry red apple on stove", but the game keeps saying "That's not a verb I recognise." Maybe the correct verb isn't "fry" but something else. Let me check the recipe again. The recipe says "fry the red apple". Maybe the game expects a different phrasing, like "cook" or "sear". Alternatively, perhaps the user needs to use the stove directly. Wait, the stove is in the kitchen, so maybe the command is "fry red apple on stove". But the user tried that. Alternatively, maybe "heat stove" first? Or "put red apple in stove"? But the recipe says "fry", so maybe the correct verb is "fry". Maybe the game is expecting "fry" as the verb, but the user is using "fry" incorrectly. Wait, the user's previous command was "fry red apple on stove", which the game didn't recognize. Maybe the correct command is "fry red apple with stove". But that also didn't work. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the stove's surface. Maybe "fry red apple on stove surface". But the game might not accept that. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the pan. But the user doesn't have a pan. The stove is there. Maybe the correct command is "fry red apple on stove". But the game says it's not a verb. Maybe the user needs to use the verb "cook" instead of "fry". Let me think. The recipe says "fry", but maybe the game uses "cook" as the verb. So the correct command would be "cook red apple on stove". But the user has to follow the recipe's instructions. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the verb "sear". But the recipe says "fry". This is confusing. The user has to follow the recipe's exact words. Maybe the game is expecting "fry" as the verb, but the user is using it incorrectly. Maybe the correct command is "fry red apple with stove". But that didn't work. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the verb "fry" without specifying the stove. But the user tried "fry red apple" and the game didn't recognize it. Maybe the game requires the user to specify the stove. So the correct command is "fry red apple on stove". But the user tried that. Maybe the game is expecting a different approach. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the verb "heat" first. But the recipe says "fry". This is tricky. The user is stuck, so maybe the next step is to try a different verb, like "cook" or "sear", even though the recipe says "fry". But the user has to follow the recipe. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the correct object. The stove is the tool. So the command should be "fry red apple with stove". But that didn't work. Maybe the game is expecting "fry" as the verb, but the user is using it incorrectly. Maybe the correct command is "fry red apple". But the game says it's not a verb. This is confusing. The user needs to find the right command that the game accepts. Maybe the answer is to use "fry" as the verb, even if the game says it's not recognized. But the user has to follow the game's rules. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the verb "cook" instead of "fry". So the next action is "cook red apple on stove".

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, the user is trying to roast the yellow potato but keeps getting errors. They tried "roast yellow potato on stove" multiple times, but the game says "That's not a verb I recognise." Maybe the correct verb isn't "roast" but something else. Let me check the recipe again. The recipe says "roast the yellow potato". Maybe the game expects a different phrasing, like "cook" or "bake". Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the oven instead of the stove. Wait, the oven is closed but the user opened it earlier. The recipe says to roast the potato, so maybe the correct command is "roast yellow potato in oven". But the user tried "on stove". Alternatively, the verb might be "heat" or "bake". The user has to follow the recipe's instructions. Maybe the game is expecting "roast" as the verb, but the user is using it incorrectly. So the next action is "roast yellow potato in oven".
