You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
This kitchen you have just entered is definitely standard.

You make out an opened fridge. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper and a green hot pepper. You can see a closed oven. You can make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a green apple, a raw purple potato, a green bell pepper, a yellow apple and a raw red potato. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Sometimes, just sometimes, TextWorld can just be the worst.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the recipe from the cookbook. The recipe says to dice the green apple, roast it, slice and roast the orange bell pepper, and dice and fry the purple potato. But the user is having trouble with the actions.

First, they tried "dice the green apple," but the game said cutting requires a knife. Then they tried using the knife on the green apple, but the system said that's not a verb. Then they tried "dice green apple" again, which didn't work. The game is probably expecting a specific command format.

Looking at the previous interactions, when the user used "use knife on green apple," the system responded with an error. Maybe the correct command is "cut green apple with knife" or something similar. But the user is stuck because they can't get the right syntax.

The user is asking if they're on the right track. The recipe does require using the knife for dicing, so the issue is with the command structure. The correct action might be "cut green apple with knife" or "dice green apple with knife." Since the game doesn't accept "use knife on," maybe the correct verb is "cut" instead of "dice" or "use."

Alternatively, maybe the game expects "cut the green apple" with the knife. But the user has tried "dice the green apple" and "use knife on green apple," both of which failed. The next step is to try the correct command format, perhaps "cut green apple with knife" or "cut the green apple with knife." Since the user is stuck, they need to figure out the right syntax. The game might be expecting "cut green apple with knife" as the next action.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, the user is trying to follow a recipe in the kitchen game. They need to dice the green apple, but the game is having trouble understanding the command. The user has tried several variations like "dice the green apple," "use knife on green apple," and "cut green apple with knife," but the game keeps responding that it only understands the first part.

Hmm, maybe the game expects a specific syntax. Let me think about how these kinds of games usually work. Often, you have to use the correct verb and object structure. The user tried "cut green apple with knife," but the game didn't recognize it. Maybe the correct command is "cut the green apple with the knife." The inclusion of "the" and "with the" might be necessary.

Alternatively, maybe the game requires using the verb "dice" with the knife. Like "dice the green apple with the knife." But the user tried "dice green apple with knife" without "the," which might be the issue. The game might be strict about article usage.

Another possibility is that the knife isn't properly identified. The user has the knife on the table, so they need to pick it up first. Wait, in the initial description, the knife is on the table. So maybe the user needs to take the knife first before using it. But the user hasn't done that yet. However, the previous attempts didn't mention taking the knife, so maybe the game assumes the knife is already in hand.

Alternatively, the game might require the user to use the knife as a tool. So the correct command could be "cut green apple with knife" but with the right structure. Since the game keeps saying it only understands up to "cut the green apple," maybe the user needs to specify "the" before apple and "the" before knife. So "cut the green apple with the knife."

But the user has tried that and it didn't work. Maybe the game is expecting a different verb. The recipe says "dice," so maybe "dice the green apple with the knife." Let's try that. If that doesn't work, maybe the game is expecting a different approach, like "slice" instead of "dice," but the recipe specifies "dice." 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to first take the knife. Let me check the initial environment. The knife is on the table. So the user might need to "take knife" first. But the user hasn't done that yet. However, the previous attempts didn't include that step. Maybe the game assumes the knife is already in hand. 

Given that, the next step is to try "dice the green apple with the knife" or "cut the green apple with the knife." Since the game didn't accept "cut green apple with knife," adding "the" might be necessary. Let's try that.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the recipe step by step. They started by opening the cookbook and reading the recipe. The first step was to dice the green apple. They tried several commands, faced some errors, and eventually took the green apple and the knife, then successfully diced it. Now, the next step according to the recipe is to roast the green apple.

So, after dicing the apple, the next action should be roasting it. But in the game, the user needs to use the correct command. The previous successful action was "dice the green apple with the knife," so maybe the next step is to roast it. The game might expect a command like "roast green apple" or "roast the green apple." Since the user has the knife and the apple, they can proceed to roast it. The stove is in the kitchen, so they might need to use the stove. But the game might just require the verb "roast" followed by the object. Let me check the previous interactions. The user has the green apple diced, so the next step is roasting. The correct command would be "roast green apple" or "roast the green apple." The game might accept either, but since the user previously used "dice the green apple," maybe "roast the green apple" is the right syntax. So the next action should be roasting the green apple.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

<think>
Okay, the user is stuck again. They tried "roast green apple on stove" but it's not working. Let me think. The recipe says "roast the green apple." Maybe the correct command is just "roast green apple" without "the" or "on stove." But the game says it's not a verb. Wait, maybe the action is "put green apple on stove" or "place green apple on stove." Alternatively, maybe "roast" is the verb, but the game expects a different structure. The user has the green apple and the knife. Maybe they need to use the stove. The stove is in the kitchen, so perhaps the correct command is "roast green apple using stove" or "roast green apple on stove." But the game doesn't recognize "roast" as a verb here. Maybe the correct action is "put green apple on stove" followed by "roast." But the user is supposed to follow the recipe steps. The recipe says "roast the green apple," so maybe the correct command is "roast green apple" even though the game says it's not a verb. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the verb "roast" with the object. But the game is not accepting it. Maybe the user should try "roast the green apple" again. Wait, the user tried "roast the green apple" before and it didn't work. Maybe the game expects "roast" without "the." Let me check previous interactions. The user tried "roast green apple" and it didn't work. Maybe the correct command is "roast green apple" but the game is expecting a different action. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the stove first. The stove is in the kitchen, so maybe "put green apple on stove" is the correct step. Then, after putting it on the stove, the game might accept "roast." But the user is supposed to follow the recipe steps. The recipe says "roast the green apple," so maybe the correct command is "roast green apple" even if the game says it's not a verb. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the verb "roast" with the object. But the game is not recognizing it. Maybe the user should try "roast green apple" again. I think the correct answer is "roast green apple" even though the game says it's not a verb. The user is following the recipe, so that's the next step.

Okay, the user is really stuck here. They've tried multiple times to roast the green apple but keep getting errors. Let me think about the possible issues. The recipe says "roast the green apple," but the game isn't recognizing "roast" as a verb. Maybe the correct action is "put the green apple on the stove" instead of trying to roast it directly. Alternatively, maybe the game expects a different verb like "sear" or "bake," but the recipe specifically says "roast." Wait, the user has the knife and the apple. Maybe they need to first place the apple on the stove before roasting. The previous steps were dicing the apple, so now they need to roast it. The game might require using the stove as a tool. So the correct command could be "put green apple on stove" or "place green apple on stove." Let me check the previous interactions. The user tried "roast green apple on stove" but it didn't work. Maybe the correct command is "put green apple on stove" followed by "roast." But the user is supposed to follow the recipe steps. The recipe says "roast the green apple," so maybe the correct command is "roast green apple" even if the game says it's not a verb. Alternatively, maybe the game is expecting "roast" as a verb with the object. But the user has tried that. Maybe the user needs to use the stove first. So the next step is to put the apple on the stove. Let's try that.
