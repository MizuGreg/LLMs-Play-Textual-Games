You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You've entered a kitchen.

You can make out a closed fridge here. You can see a closed oven in the corner. Were you looking for a table? Because look over there, it's a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You can see a counter. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a counter? You see a raw red potato, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. Hmmm... what else, what else? You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What's the point of an empty stove?

There is a closed frosted-glass door leading north. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game where they need to cook a meal using the ingredients from the kitchen. The goal is to follow the recipe in the cookbook.

So far, the player has taken the red potato and is trying to get the other ingredients. The recipe requires an orange bell pepper, a red potato, and red tuna. They've got the red potato, but the other two are missing. The user tried to take the orange bell pepper but couldn't see it. Then they looked around again and still couldn't find it. The red tuna is also not present, which is confusing because it's listed as an ingredient.

Wait, the kitchen has a counter with a raw red potato, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a cookbook, and a knife. The user has already taken the red potato. The orange bell pepper isn't mentioned on the counter, so maybe it's somewhere else? But the description says the counter has those items. Maybe the orange bell pepper is in the fridge or oven? But the fridge is closed. The user hasn't checked the fridge yet. The oven is in the corner, but it's closed. Maybe the orange bell pepper is in the fridge? But the user hasn't opened it. Also, the red tuna isn't on the counter, so maybe it's in the fridge or another location.

The user's last action was looking at the orange bell pepper, but they couldn't see it. So maybe they need to check the fridge. The recipe says "orange bell pepper," which is a specific ingredient. The user might need to open the fridge to find it. Alternatively, maybe the red tuna is in the fridge. The user hasn't tried opening the fridge yet. The initial description mentions a closed fridge, so the next logical step would be to open it and check if the ingredients are inside.

So the next action should be to open the fridge. That makes sense because the user hasn't checked there yet. The fridge might contain the missing ingredients. Let's see: the user has the red potato, needs orange bell pepper and red tuna. If the fridge has those, then opening it would help. Alternatively, maybe the red tuna is in the oven, but that seems less likely. The stove is empty, so probably not. The fridge is the next place to check.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the recipe from the cookbook. They've gathered the ingredients: red potato, red bell pepper, and red tuna. The next step in the recipe is to dice the orange bell pepper, grill it, then dice the red potato, grill it, slice the red tuna, and fry it. Then prepare the meal.

Wait, the user took the red bell pepper from the fridge. The recipe says "dice the orange bell pepper." But the user has a red bell pepper. Maybe that's a typo in the recipe, or maybe they need to use the red one. But the recipe specifies orange. Hmm. But the user might not have an orange bell pepper. Wait, in the fridge, they found a red bell pepper. Maybe that's the one they need to use. Or maybe the recipe has a mistake. But the user has to follow the recipe as given.

So the next step is to dice the orange bell pepper. But the user only has a red bell pepper. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in taking the red bell pepper instead of the orange. But the recipe says orange. However, in the fridge, the user found a red bell pepper. Maybe the recipe's "orange" is a mistake, and they should use the red one. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to find an orange bell pepper somewhere else. But the kitchen counter only has a raw red potato, red apple, purple potato, cookbook, and knife. The fridge has red tuna, red bell pepper, and white tuna. So the user doesn't have an orange bell pepper. But the recipe says orange. This is a problem.

Wait, maybe the user is supposed to use the red bell pepper as the orange one. Maybe it's a typo in the recipe. Or maybe the user needs to proceed with the red bell pepper. The user has already taken the red bell pepper. So the next step is to dice it. But the user tried to use the knife on it, but the system didn't recognize the command. The user tried "dice red bell pepper" again, but the system asked what to dice it with. So the correct command would be to use the knife on the red bell pepper. But the user tried "use knife on red bell pepper" and it didn't work. Then the user tried "dice red bell pepper" again, and the system asked for the tool. So the correct action is to use the knife to dice the red bell pepper. But the user might need to first use the knife on the bell pepper. So the next step is to use the knife on the red bell pepper to dice it. Then proceed with the recipe steps.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the recipe steps. They have the red bell pepper diced. The next step in the recipe is to grill the orange bell pepper. But the user has a red bell pepper. Maybe there's a mistake in the recipe, but they have to proceed with what's available. The user tried to grill the red bell pepper but got errors. The possible tools are the stove, oven, or grill. The recipe says "grill," so maybe the user needs to use the grill. But the system isn't recognizing the command. Maybe the correct command is to use the grill on the red bell pepper. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the stove or oven. But the recipe specifies "grill," so the grill is the right tool. The user might need to specify "grill red bell pepper" again, but the system says it's not a verb. Maybe the correct command is "put red bell pepper on grill" or "grill with grill." But the user has to follow the exact command format. Since the previous attempts didn't work, maybe the correct action is to use the grill on the red bell pepper. The user should try "grill red bell pepper" again, even though it's not working. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the stove. But the recipe says grill. Hmm. The user might need to use the grill, so the next action is to grill the red bell pepper.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, the user is trying to follow the recipe steps but is stuck on the "grill" command. Let me check the previous steps. They have the red bell pepper diced and need to grill it. The recipe says "grill the orange bell pepper," but they have a red one. Maybe the game expects them to use the grill tool. The user tried "grill red bell pepper" multiple times, but the system says it's not a verb. Maybe the correct command is to use the grill on the red bell pepper. The possible tools are stove, oven, or grill. The recipe says "grill," so the grill is the right tool. The user might need to specify "grill red bell pepper" again, even though it's not working. Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "put red bell pepper on grill" or "grill with grill." But the system isn't recognizing it. Maybe the user needs to use the stove instead. The recipe might have a mistake, but the user has to proceed. The next action should be to grill the red bell pepper using the available tool.

Let me think about the possible commands again. The recipe says "grill the orange bell pepper," but the user has a red one. Maybe the game expects them to use the word "cook" instead of "grill." Alternatively, maybe the correct command is to use the stove's function. But the system isn't recognizing "grill." Maybe the user needs to use the word "put" to place the bell pepper on the stove. Or perhaps the correct action is to "heat" the stove. But the recipe specifies "grill." Hmm. The user has to follow the exact steps.

Okay, the user is really stuck here. They've tried multiple times to grill the red bell pepper with the stove, but the system keeps saying it's not a verb. Let me think about the possible commands again. The recipe says "grill the orange bell pepper," but the user has a red one. Maybe the game expects them to use the word "cook" instead of "grill." Alternatively, maybe the correct action is to use the stove's function. But the system isn't recognizing "grill." Maybe the user needs to use the word "heat" or "burn." Alternatively, maybe the correct command is to "put" the bell pepper on the stove and then "grill" it. But the system isn't recognizing "grill." Hmm. The user has to follow the exact steps. Since the system isn't recognizing "grill," maybe the correct action is to use the stove's function. Let me try that.
