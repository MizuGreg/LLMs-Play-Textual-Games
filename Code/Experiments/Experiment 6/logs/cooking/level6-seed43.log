-= Bedroom =-
You arrive in a bedroom. A typical one. You begin looking for stuff.

You scan the room for a bed, and you find a bed. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.

-= Livingroom =-
You find yourself in a livingroom. A standard one.



You need an exit without a door? You should try going east. There is an exit to the north.

-= Kitchen =-
You've just shown up in a kitchen. The room is well lit.

You can make out an opened fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop, a block of cheese, a lettuce, an orange bell pepper, a red onion, a red bell pepper, a raw white tuna, a white onion and a raw red tuna. You make out an oven. Now why would someone leave that there? What's that over there? It looks like it's a table. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a tomato and a red hot pepper. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is an open plain door leading east. You need an exit without a door? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.
