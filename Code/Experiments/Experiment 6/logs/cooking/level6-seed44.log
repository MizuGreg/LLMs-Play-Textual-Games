You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Bedroom =-
You're now in the bedroom.

You can make out a bed. The bed is large. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

-= Corridor =-
You arrive in a corridor. An ordinary kind of place.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door. There is an exit to the west.

-= Kitchen =-
Well, here we are in the kitchen.

You can see an opened fridge, which looks conventional, in the corner. The fridge contains a yellow onion, a green bell pepper, a green hot pepper, a red hot pepper, a yellow apple and a red onion. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see an oven. You scan the room for a table, and you find a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a raw yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper and a raw red potato. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.

There is an open frosted-glass door leading east. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.

-= Kitchen =-
Well, here we are in the kitchen.

You can see an opened fridge, which looks conventional, in the corner. The fridge contains a yellow onion, a green bell pepper, a green hot pepper, a red hot pepper, a yellow apple and a red onion. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see an oven. You scan the room for a table, and you find a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a raw yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper and a raw red potato. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.

There is an open frosted-glass door leading east. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.

Well, here we are in the kitchen.

You can see an opened fridge, which looks conventional, in the corner. The fridge contains a yellow onion, a green bell pepper, a green hot pepper, a red hot pepper, a yellow apple and a red onion. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see an oven. You scan the room for a table, and you find a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a raw yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper and a raw red potato. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.

There is an open frosted-glass door leading east. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.
