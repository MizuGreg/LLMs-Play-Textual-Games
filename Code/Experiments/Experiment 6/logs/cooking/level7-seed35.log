You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Bathroom =-
You find yourself in a bathroom. A normal kind of place.

You see a toilet! The toilet is white. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You think about smashing the toilet to bits, throwing the bits in the dump, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on.

There is an exit to the north.
