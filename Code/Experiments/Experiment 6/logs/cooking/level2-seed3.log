You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
Well, here we are in a kitchen. The room is well lit.

You make out an opened fridge nearby. The fridge contains a raw pork chop. You make out an oven. You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a knife. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You scan the room, seeing a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a kitchen, and the goal is to cook a meal. The first action was to take the cookbook from the table, but that wasn't possible. So maybe the cookbook isn't on the table anymore or isn't visible. The user needs to find the recipe.

Looking at the kitchen description again: on the table, there's a knife, a raw red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, and the cookbook. Wait, the user tried to take the cookbook but couldn't. Maybe the cookbook is in a different location? Or perhaps the user needs to check the fridge or counter?

Wait, the fridge has a raw pork chop. The counter has the potatoes and pepper. The oven is there. Maybe the recipe is in the cookbook, but the user needs to find it. Since the initial attempt to take the cookbook failed, maybe the user needs to look elsewhere. Alternatively, maybe the cookbook is on the counter instead of the table? Let me check the original description again.

Original description: "On the table you see a knife. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook." Oh, the cookbook is on the counter, not the table. The user tried to take it from the table, which was a mistake. So the correct location is the counter. So the next action should be to take the cookbook from the counter.

But the user's first action was to take it from the table, which wasn't possible. So the correct action is to take the cookbook from the counter. Then, after getting the recipe, the user can proceed to cook the pork chop with the potatoes and pepper. So the next step is to take the cookbook from the counter.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal in the kitchen. They found the cookbook on the counter, so that's a good step. Now, the next logical thing would be to check the recipe in the cookbook. But wait, the user has to interact with the cookbook somehow. Since they took it from the counter, maybe they need to open it. But the game's previous responses might have restrictions. The user can't just open it; maybe they need to read it or find the recipe. Alternatively, maybe they need to use the ingredients they have. The fridge has a pork chop, and on the table there's a knife, potatoes, and a pepper. The oven is there. So the next step is probably to look at the cookbook to find the recipe. But the user already took the cookbook, so maybe they need to read it. However, the game might require a specific command like "open cookbook" or "read recipe". But the user's previous action was taking the cookbook from the counter. Now, the next step would be to open it to find the recipe. But the system message says to only output the action. So the correct next step is to open the cookbook.

<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what to do next. The user is in a kitchen game where they need to cook a meal. So far, they've taken the cookbook from the counter, but it wasn't openable. The original goal is to cook a delicious meal, so maybe the next step is to find a recipe or ingredients.

Wait, the cookbook is probably the key here. Since it wasn't openable, maybe they need to look for a way to open it. But the user tried to open it and it didn't work. Maybe they need to check the fridge or other areas for ingredients. The fridge has a raw pork chop, and on the table there's a knife, potatoes, a pepper, etc. The cookbook might have a recipe that requires using those ingredients.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to find the right recipe in the cookbook. Since the cookbook is on the counter, maybe they need to look through it. But the game said they can't open it. Maybe the next step is to check the fridge for the pork chop and then use the ingredients to cook. The stove is there, so maybe they need to cook the pork chop with the potatoes and pepper. But how?

Wait, the user has the cookbook, but can't open it. Maybe the next step is to look for a recipe in the cookbook. But since it's not openable, perhaps they need to find a way to use it. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to find the right ingredients first. The cookbook might have a recipe that requires specific items. The user has the raw pork chop, potatoes, and a pepper. Maybe they need to cook the pork chop with those. But the stove is conventional, so maybe they need to put the pork chop on the stove and add the ingredients. But the user hasn't used the stove yet. So maybe the next step is to use the stove with the pork chop and other ingredients. But the user hasn't done that yet. Alternatively, maybe they need to look for the recipe in the cookbook, but since it's not openable, maybe they need to find another way. Hmm.

Wait, the user tried to take the cookbook from the counter, and then tried to open it. The game said it wasn't openable. Maybe the cookbook is in the fridge? No, the fridge has the pork chop. Maybe the user needs to check the stove again. Or maybe the user needs to use the knife to cut the ingredients. The knife is on the table. So maybe the next step is to take the knife and cut the potatoes or pepper. Then use the stove to cook them with the pork chop. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action might be to take the knife from the table. But the user hasn't taken it yet. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to look for the recipe in the cookbook, but since it's not openable, maybe they need to find another way. Wait, maybe the user needs to check the cookbook again. But the game said it's not openable. Maybe the user needs to look for a way to open it. Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to use the cookbook to find the recipe, but since it's not openable, perhaps the next step is to look for the recipe in another way. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Maybe the user needs to take the knife first. Let me check the items again. The table has a knife, so the next action could be to take the knife. Then use it to prepare the ingredients. Then cook them on the stove. So the next step is to take the knife from the table.

Okay, let's see. The player is trying to cook a meal. They started by taking the cookbook from the counter, then tried to open it but couldn't. Then they took the knife from the table. Now, they need to proceed.

The goal is to cook a delicious meal, so they need to follow a recipe. The cookbook was probably needed to get the recipe. Since they couldn't open it, maybe they need to find another way. But the user said to check the cookbook in the kitchen, so maybe the cookbook is part of the recipe.

Wait, the user mentioned the cookbook is on the counter. The player took it from the counter. But then the game said it isn't something you can open. Maybe the cookbook is a book that needs to be read, but in the game, maybe the player needs to use it to find the recipe. Alternatively, maybe the player needs to use the ingredients they have.

The player has a raw pork chop, potatoes, a pepper, and a knife. Maybe they need to cook the pork chop with the potatoes and pepper. But the oven is available. So the steps would be: prepare the ingredients, cook them in the oven.

But the player hasn't used the oven yet. Maybe they need to put the pork chop and vegetables in the oven. But they need to chop the vegetables first. They have a knife, so they can cut the potatoes and pepper. Then put them in the oven. But the stove is there too. Maybe they need to sauté the vegetables first.

Wait, the stove is conventional, but there's nothing on it. So maybe the player needs to use the oven. The oven is in the kitchen. So the next step would be to use the oven. But how? They need to put food in. They have the pork chop, potatoes, and pepper. Maybe they need to chop the potatoes and pepper with the knife, then put them in the oven with the pork chop.

But the player hasn't chopped anything yet. So the next action should be to chop the potatoes and pepper. But the player has the knife. So the next step is to chop the potatoes and pepper. But the game might require specific commands. The player has the knife, so they can cut the potatoes and pepper. Then put them in the oven. Then cook.

But the user's previous action was taking the knife. Now, the next step would be to use the knife to chop the potatoes and pepper. So the command would be to chop the potatoes with the knife. But the game might have specific verbs. Alternatively, the player might need to put the ingredients into the oven.

Alternatively, maybe the player needs to check the cookbook again. But the game said it can't be opened. Maybe the recipe is in the cookbook, but the player needs to read it. But since they can't open it, maybe they need to use the ingredients they have. The original goal is to cook a meal, so the player should proceed to cook the pork chop with the potatoes and pepper.

So the next action would be to put the pork chop, potatoes, and pepper into the oven. But the oven is in the kitchen. So the player needs to go to the oven and put the ingredients in. But the player is already in the kitchen. So the command would be to put the ingredients into the oven. But the player has to have the ingredients. They have the pork chop, and the potatoes and pepper are on the counter. So the player needs to take them.

Wait, the player has the knife. They took the knife from the table. The raw potatoes are on the counter. So the player needs to take the potatoes and pepper. Then chop them with the knife. Then put them in the oven. So the next steps would be to take the potatoes and pepper, chop them, then put them in the oven.

But the user's last action was taking the knife. So the next action should be to take the potatoes. But the player is in the kitchen. The table has the knife, but the potatoes are on the counter. So the player needs to take the potatoes from the counter. But the user's previous action was taking the knife from the table. So the next step is to take the potatoes. But the game might require specific commands.

Alternatively, the player might need to use the knife to chop the potatoes. So the command would be to chop the potato with the knife. But the game might require the player to take the potato first. So the next action is to take the potato from the counter. Then chop it. Then put it in the oven.

But the user's previous action was taking the knife. So the next action is to take the potato. But the counter has a raw red potato, yellow potato, and a red hot pepper. So the player needs to take one or both. Maybe take the red potato first. Then chop it. Then put it in the oven. Then do the same with the yellow potato and pepper.

But the game might require the player to use the oven. So the next action is to put the ingredients into the oven. But the player needs to have them. So the next step is to take the potatoes and pepper, chop them, then put them in the oven. Then cook.

So the next command should be to take the red potato from the counter. Then chop it. Then put it in the oven. But the user's last action was taking the knife. So the next action is to take the potato. But the game might have specific verbs. The player is in the kitchen, so the next action is to take the potato.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal in the kitchen. The goal is to follow the cookbook recipe. So far, they've taken the cookbook from the counter, but couldn't open it. Then they took the knife from the table, red potato from the counter. Now they have a score of 1/5.

Wait, the original goal was to cook a delicious meal by checking the cookbook. The user needs to find the recipe steps. The cookbook might be the key. But they couldn't open it earlier. Maybe they need to find another way to use it. Alternatively, maybe the recipe is in the cookbook, but they need to interact with it properly.

Wait, the user took the cookbook from the counter, but the system said "It isn't something you can open." So maybe the cookbook is not openable, but perhaps they need to read it somehow. Or maybe the steps are in the cookbook, but they need to find the right ingredients first.

The user has already taken the red potato, knife, and the cookbook. The fridge has a raw pork chop, and the counter has yellow potato, red hot pepper. So maybe the recipe requires those ingredients. The user needs to cook the pork chop with the potatoes and pepper. But how?

The next step might be to use the knife to prepare the ingredients. For example, chop the pork chop, slice the potatoes, and maybe the pepper. Then cook them in the oven or on the stove. But the stove is conventional and has nothing on it. The oven is there. So maybe the user needs to put the ingredients in the oven.

But the user hasn't used the knife on the pork chop yet. They have the knife, so maybe they need to cut the pork chop. Then, maybe cook it. But the user needs to follow the recipe steps from the cookbook. Since the cookbook wasn't openable, maybe they need to find another way. Or perhaps the recipe is in the cookbook, but the user needs to interact with it differently.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check the cookbook again. But the system said it can't be opened. Maybe the user needs to look at the cookbook's contents in another way. Or maybe the steps are in the environment. The user has to cook the pork chop with the potatoes and pepper. So the next action could be to use the knife on the pork chop. Let's see, the user has the knife. So maybe "cut pork chop with knife" or something like that. But the system might expect specific commands.

Alternatively, the user might need to put the ingredients into the oven. So the next step is to put the pork chop, potatoes, and pepper into the oven. But the user hasn't done that yet. So maybe the next action is to put the pork chop in the oven. But the user has to have the pork chop. Wait, the fridge has a raw pork chop. The user hasn't taken it yet. So maybe the next step is to take the pork chop from the fridge. Then, prepare it with the knife, then cook it in the oven.

So the user's current items are the cookbook, knife, red potato. They need to take the pork chop from the fridge. Then, maybe cut it, then cook. So the next action should be to take the pork chop from the fridge. Let me check the previous steps. The user hasn't taken the pork chop yet. So the next action is to take the pork chop from the fridge.

Okay, let's see. The player is trying to cook a meal in the kitchen. The goal is to follow the cookbook recipe. So far, they've taken the cookbook from the counter, but it wasn't openable. Then they took the knife from the table, a red potato from the counter, and the pork chop from the fridge. Each of these items seems like they'd be needed for cooking.

The next logical step would be to use the knife to prepare the pork chop. Since the cookbook was mentioned, maybe they need to check it again, but earlier it wasn't openable. Wait, maybe the cookbook is now accessible after taking it? Or perhaps they need to open it using the knife? Alternatively, maybe the recipe requires chopping the pork chop, so using the knife on it makes sense. The player has the knife now, so they could chop the pork chop. That would be a step towards cooking. Let me check the items again: they have the knife, pork chop, red potato, and maybe the red hot pepper and yellow potato are still on the counter. But the user hasn't taken those yet. However, the recipe might require specific ingredients. The original prompt mentioned a recipe in the cookbook, so maybe the steps involve preparing the pork chop and other vegetables. The next action should be to chop the pork chop with the knife. So the command would be "chop pork chop with knife" or something similar. But the game might expect a specific format. Since the user has the knife and the pork chop, the next action is to chop the pork chop. So the correct command is "chop pork chop with knife".
