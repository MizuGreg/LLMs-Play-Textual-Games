You arrive in a kitchen. An usual kind of place.

You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a fridge. You see a closed oven close by. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table! oh well. What's that over there? It looks like it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a red hot pepper, a yellow apple, a red onion, a green hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is a closed frosted-glass door leading south. You need an exit without a door? You should try going north.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe in the cookbook. The recipe requires chopping the orange bell pepper, roasting it, slicing the red hot pepper, frying it, slicing white tuna, grilling it, and then preparing the meal.

So far, the user tried to "chop the orange bell pepper," but the game responded that they can't see any such thing. That means the ingredient might not be available or maybe the action needs to be adjusted. Let me check the inventory or the current items in the kitchen again.

Looking back at the kitchen description, the counter has a red hot pepper, yellow apple, red onion, green hot pepper, cookbook, and a knife. Wait, the recipe calls for an orange bell pepper, but the available peppers are red hot and green hot. There's no orange bell pepper listed. That's a problem. The user might have misread the ingredient, thinking there's an orange bell pepper when there's actually a red hot pepper and a green hot pepper. Maybe the game expects the user to use the available ingredients even if they don't match the recipe exactly. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to find another way to get the orange bell pepper, but in the current setup, it's not present.

Since the user can't see the orange bell pepper, perhaps they need to look elsewhere. But the fridge is mentioned, but it's closed. Maybe they need to open the fridge to check if there's an orange bell pepper inside. Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to use the red hot pepper instead, even though the recipe says orange bell. But the game might be strict about the ingredients. 

The next step would be to check the fridge. The user hasn't opened it yet. The fridge is closed, so the next action should be to open it. If the fridge has the orange bell pepper, then proceed. If not, maybe the user needs to find another way. But according to the current items, the orange bell pepper isn't there. So maybe the user made a mistake in the recipe, but the game expects them to proceed with the available items. However, the game's response indicates that the action "chop the orange bell pepper" is invalid because it's not present. Therefore, the user needs to check the fridge first to see if the ingredient is there. 

So the correct next action would be to open the fridge. That's the logical step because the ingredient isn't on the counter, and the fridge is the next place to check. The user might have missed that the orange bell pepper is in the fridge. So the next command should be "open fridge".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the recipe from the cookbook. The first step was to chop the orange bell pepper. They tried that, but the game said they couldn't see any such thing. Then they checked the fridge, found the orange bell pepper, and tried chopping it again. The response was that cutting something requires a knife.

So, the user needs to use the knife. The knife is on the counter, as mentioned in the initial description. The user hasn't picked up the knife yet. So the next step should be to take the knife. Once they have the knife, they can chop the orange bell pepper. Let me check the previous actions. The user tried "chop orange bell pepper" after finding the pepper in the fridge. The game responded that a knife is needed. Therefore, the correct next action is to take the knife from the counter.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to chop the orange bell pepper, but the game keeps saying that a knife is needed. They already took the knife from the counter. Wait, maybe they didn't use the knife yet. The previous action was "chop orange bell pepper" again, but the game is reminding them they need a knife. But they already have the knife. Maybe the knife isn't in their inventory. Let me check the previous steps.

The user took the knife from the counter. So the knife should be available. Maybe the action is supposed to be "chop the orange bell pepper with the knife" or something similar. But the game's syntax might require just "chop orange bell pepper" if the knife is in hand. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the knife first. Wait, the user tried chopping again without using the knife. So the correct action is to chop the orange bell pepper, and the game should now accept it because the knife is taken. But the game is still saying "Cutting something requires a knife." Maybe the knife isn't being used properly. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the knife command. But the game's previous responses indicate that the knife is needed. Since the user already took the knife, the next step is to chop the pepper. The game might be stuck in a loop. But according to the rules, the user should proceed with the correct action. So the next command is "chop orange bell pepper".

Hmm, maybe the correct command is "roast the orange bell pepper" instead of just "roast orange bell pepper". The game might require the article "the" or the correct phrasing. Let me check previous interactions. The user used "chop the orange bell pepper" before, which worked. So maybe "roast the orange bell pepper" is the right command. Let me try that.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to roast the orange bell pepper but the game doesn't recognize "roast" as a verb. Maybe the correct command is "roast the orange bell pepper" with the article "the". But the user tried that and it still didn't work. Alternatively, maybe the action is supposed to be "put in oven" or "place in oven" since the oven is mentioned. The recipe says to roast the pepper, so perhaps the user needs to put it in the oven. But the oven is closed. So first, they need to open the oven, then put the pepper inside. Let me check the previous steps. The user has the orange bell pepper and the knife. The oven is closed. So the next steps would be to open the oven, then put the pepper in. But the user is stuck on the roast command. Maybe the correct action is "put orange bell pepper in oven" after opening it. But the game might require specific verbs. Alternatively, maybe "roast" is a valid verb here, but the user needs to use the correct syntax. Since the game didn't accept "roast orange bell pepper", maybe it's "roast the orange bell pepper". But the user tried that and it didn't work. Maybe the user needs to use "roast" as a verb with the object. Alternatively, maybe the game expects "roast" to be used with the oven. But the oven is closed. So perhaps the correct sequence is: open oven, then roast the pepper. But the user is stuck on the roast command. Maybe the answer is to try "roast the orange bell pepper" again, but the game is not recognizing it. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use "put in oven" after opening it. Let me think. The user has the orange bell pepper. The oven is closed. So first, open the oven. Then, put the pepper in. Then, roast it. But the recipe says to roast it. So maybe the correct action is "put orange bell pepper in oven" after opening. But the user is trying to roast it directly. Maybe the game requires the user to first put it in the oven, then roast. But the user is at the step where they have the pepper and the knife. So the next action should be to open the oven, then put the pepper in, then roast. But the user is stuck on the roast command.

Okay, the user is trying to follow the recipe steps. They've chopped the orange bell pepper, roasted it in the oven, sliced the red hot pepper. The next step is to fry the red hot pepper. But the game says "That's not a verb I recognise." Earlier, when they tried "roast orange bell pepper", it didn't work, but then they put it in the oven and it worked. Maybe the correct command is "fry the red hot pepper" with the article "the". Let me check previous interactions. The user used "chop the orange bell pepper" which worked. So maybe "fry the red hot pepper" is the correct command. Let me try that.

Okay, the user is stuck on the "fry red hot pepper" command. The game keeps saying it's not a recognized verb. Let me think about the possible correct commands. Earlier, "roast the orange bell pepper" worked when they put it in the oven. Maybe "fry" requires a different approach. Perhaps they need to use "put in pan" or "heat pan" first. But the user hasn't mentioned a pan. The stove is in the kitchen, but there's nothing on it. Maybe the correct step is to put the red hot pepper in the pan. But the user hasn't taken the pan. Alternatively, maybe the verb is "cook" instead of "fry". Or maybe "saute". But the recipe says "fry". Wait, the user has the red hot pepper and the knife. Maybe the correct action is to use the stove. Since the stove is there, maybe "put red hot pepper on stove" or "heat stove". But the game might require specific verbs. Alternatively, maybe "fry" is a valid verb here, but the user needs to use the correct syntax. Let me check previous steps. The user tried "fry the red hot pepper" and it didn't work. Maybe the game expects "fry" without the article, so "fry red hot pepper". But that didn't work either. Maybe the correct action is to use the stove. So the next step is to "put red hot pepper on stove" or "put in stove". But the user hasn't done that yet. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the oven again, but the oven is already open. Hmm. The recipe says to fry the red hot pepper, so perhaps the correct command is "fry red hot pepper" but the game is not recognizing it. Maybe the user needs to use the stove. So the next action is to "put red hot pepper on stove".

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the oven again, but that's for roasting. The recipe says to fry, so maybe the correct action is to use the stove. But the game isn't accepting "fry".

You arrive in a kitchen. An usual kind of place.

You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a fridge. The fridge contains a raw white tuna, a yellow bell pepper, a raw pork chop, a block of cheese, a carrot, a red bell pepper, a white onion, a raw red tuna and a lettuce. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You see an opened oven close by. The oven contains a chopped orange bell pepper. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table! oh well. What's that over there? It looks like it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a yellow apple, a red onion, a green hot pepper and a cookbook. You see a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is a closed frosted-glass door leading south. You need an exit without a door? You should try going north.

Okay, the user is stuck on the "fry red hot pepper" command. The game keeps saying it's not a recognized verb. Let me think about the possible correct commands. Earlier, when they roasted the orange bell pepper, they had to put it in the oven. Maybe for frying, they need to use the stove. The user tried "put red hot pepper on stove" but it didn't work. Maybe the correct action is to "heat the stove" or "turn on stove". But the game says "That's not a verb I recognise." Alternatively, maybe the verb is "cook" instead of "fry". Let me try "cook red hot pepper".

But the game isn't recognizing "fry" as a verb. Let me think about the possible correct commands. Earlier, when they tried "fry the red hot pepper", it didn't work. The user might need to use the stove. The stove is in the kitchen, but there's nothing on it. Maybe the correct action is to put the red hot pepper on the stove.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, the user is stuck on the "fry red hot pepper" command. The game keeps saying it's not a recognized verb. Let me think about the possible correct commands. Earlier, when they roasted the orange bell pepper, they had to put it in the oven. Maybe for frying, they need to use the stove. The user tried "put red hot pepper on stove" but it didn't work. Maybe the correct action is to "heat the stove" or "turn on stove". But the game says "That's not a verb I recognise." Alternatively, maybe the verb is "cook" instead of "fry". Let me try "cook red hot pepper".
