You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. A typical kind of place.

You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to a fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop, a red onion and a lettuce. A closed oven is in the room. You smell a sickening smell, and follow it to a table. On the table you make out a knife. You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a raw red potato, a yellow apple and a cookbook. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe in the cookbook. So far, they've taken the cookbook, tried to open it (but couldn't), then looked around, and finally looked at the cookbook. The recipe says to dice the pork chop, roast it, and prepare the meal.

The user currently has the knife. The next step after dicing the pork chop would be roasting it. But to roast, they need to put it in the oven. The recipe mentions a closed oven in the kitchen. So the next logical steps are to roast the pork chop in the oven. But wait, the user has the knife, so maybe they need to first dice the pork chop. Wait, the user just did "dice pork chop" and the system responded that cutting requires a knife. Then the user took the knife. Now, with the knife, they can dice the pork chop. So the next action should be to dice the pork chop again. But the user already tried that. Wait, the user's last action was taking the knife. Now, the next step is to use the knife to dice the pork chop. But the user might have already diced it. Let me check the history.

The user's actions: take cookbook, open cookbook (failed), look around, look at cookbook, then dice pork chop. The system responded that cutting requires a knife. Then the user took the knife. Now, with the knife, they can proceed to dice the pork chop. So the next action should be to dice the pork chop again. But maybe the user is supposed to roast it now. Wait, the recipe says "dice the pork chop, roast the pork chop, prepare meal." So after dicing, roast. So after getting the knife, the user should dice the pork chop again. But the user might have already done that. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to put the diced pork chop into the oven. But the oven is closed. So maybe the next step is to roast the pork chop. But the user needs to have the pork chop in the oven. So the steps are: dice pork chop with knife, then put it in the oven, then roast. But the user has the knife now. So the next action is to dice the pork chop again. Wait, the user just took the knife, so they can now dice the pork chop. So the next command should be "dice pork chop" again. But the user might have already done that. Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to roast it now. But the recipe says to roast after dicing. So the correct sequence is dice, then roast. So the user needs to first dice the pork chop with the knife, then roast it. Since the user has the knife, the next action is to dice the pork chop again. So the answer is "dice pork chop".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the recipe from the cookbook. The recipe says to dice the pork chop, roast it, and then prepare the meal. So far, the user has taken the cookbook, tried to open it (but couldn't), looked around, and then tried to dice the pork chop. They took the knife from the table. Now, they're at the step where they need to roast the pork chop.

But the system keeps saying "roast pork chop" is not a recognized verb. Hmm. Maybe the correct command is different. Let me check the previous interactions. The user tried "roast pork chop" and it didn't work. Maybe the actual command is "put pork chop in oven" or "place pork chop in oven"? Since the oven is closed, maybe they need to open it first. Wait, the oven is closed, so maybe the user needs to open it before putting the pork chop in. But the recipe says "roast the pork chop," which implies putting it in the oven. Alternatively, maybe the correct verb is "roast," but the system is expecting a different command. Or perhaps "roast" is a valid verb here, but the system is rejecting it. Maybe the user needs to use "roast" as a verb with the pork chop. But the system says it's not a recognized verb. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use "cook" instead of "roast." But the recipe specifically says "roast." 

Wait, the user has the knife and the pork chop. They diced the pork chop, but the system said cutting requires a knife, which they have. Now, after dicing, they need to roast it. Maybe the correct command is "roast pork chop" but the system is not recognizing it. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "put pork chop in oven." Let me think. The oven is closed, so maybe the user needs to open it first. But the recipe doesn't mention opening the oven. Alternatively, maybe the user can just roast it without opening. But the oven is closed. Maybe the correct action is to "roast pork chop" even if the system says it's not a verb. Or maybe the user needs to "place pork chop in oven." But the system might require the exact command. Since the user has tried "roast pork chop" multiple times and it's not working, maybe the correct command is "put pork chop in oven." Let me check the available actions. The user is in the kitchen with a closed oven. So the next step is to put the pork chop in the oven. So the correct command would be "put pork chop in oven." But the user might need to open the oven first. However, the recipe doesn't mention opening it. Maybe the oven is already open. Wait, the initial description says "a closed oven is in the room." So the oven is closed. Therefore, the user needs to open it first. But the recipe doesn't mention that. However, in reality, you need to open the oven before putting anything in. So maybe the user needs to open the oven first. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the steps would be: open oven, then put pork chop in, then roast. But the recipe says "roast the pork chop," which might imply that putting it in the oven is the action. So the user needs to "put pork chop in oven." But the system might not recognize that command. Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "roast pork chop," but the system is rejecting it. Since the user is stuck, maybe the correct next action is to "put pork chop in oven." Let me try that.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe. They've followed the steps: took the cookbook, diced the pork chop with the knife, put it in the oven after opening it. Now, the next step according to the recipe is to "prepare meal." But the user hasn't done that yet. The current state is that the pork chop is in the oven. So the next action should be to prepare the meal. But what does "prepare meal" mean in this context? Maybe it's just confirming that the meal is ready, or maybe there's another step. Since the recipe's directions are "dice the pork chop, roast the pork chop, prepare meal," the user has done the first two steps. The last step is "prepare meal," which might just be finishing the cooking process. So the next command should be "prepare meal." But I need to check if that's the correct action. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to take the cooked pork chop out of the oven and serve it. But the recipe doesn't mention that. The recipe's directions are pretty minimal. So the next step is to prepare the meal, which might just be the final action. So the answer is "prepare meal."

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal. They followed the recipe steps: diced the pork chop, roasted it in the oven, took it out. Now they need to serve it. The last attempt was "serve pork chop," which the system rejected.

Hmm, maybe the correct verb is "eat" instead of "serve"? Or perhaps "prepare meal" is the final step. Wait, the recipe says "prepare meal," but the user has already prepared the pork chop. Maybe the game expects a different command. Alternatively, since the user has the pork chop, they might need to "consume" it. But the system might not recognize "eat" or "consume." Alternatively, maybe "serve" is correct, but the system's response was wrong. Or maybe the user needs to "finish meal" or "complete meal." But the system says "serve" isn't a verb. Wait, maybe the correct action is "prepare meal" again. But the user already did that. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "put pork chop on plate" or something similar. But the system might not recognize that. Since the user is close, maybe the next step is to "eat pork chop" even if it's not a recognized verb. Or perhaps the game expects "serve" to be the correct command, and the system's response was an error. But the user has to follow the system's rules. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "finish" the meal. But the system says "serve" isn't a verb. Maybe the correct answer is "prepare meal" again. But the user already did that.

Okay, let's try to figure out what's going on here. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe in the cookbook. The recipe says to dice the pork chop, roast it, and prepare the meal. So far, the user has diced the pork chop with the knife, put it in the oven after opening it, took it out, and tried to serve it. But the system is rejecting some commands.

The last few attempts were trying to "roast pork chop" again, but the system says that's not a recognized verb. Maybe the correct command is different. Let me check the previous steps again. The user put the pork chop in the oven, so maybe the roasting is already done when it's in the oven. The recipe says "roast the pork chop," which might mean putting it in the oven. But the user already did that. So maybe the next step is to "prepare meal," but that was tried before. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "eat" the pork chop, but the system doesn't recognize "eat." Or perhaps the game expects a different verb like "cook" instead of "roast." But the recipe specifically says "roast."

Wait, the user has the pork chop in the oven, so maybe the roasting is already done. The next step is to prepare the meal, which might just be taking the cooked pork chop and serving it. But the system rejected "serve." Maybe the correct command is "eat pork chop," even if it's not a recognized verb. Alternatively, the game might require the user to "finish meal" or "complete meal." But the user is stuck here. Since the user is close to the goal, maybe the next action is to "eat pork chop" even if it's not recognized. Alternatively, the game might have a specific command like "serve" that's accepted. But the system says "serve" isn't a verb. Maybe the user needs to "prepare meal" again. But that was tried before. Hmm. The user is in the kitchen, has the pork chop, and the oven is open. The original goal was to enjoy the meal. Maybe the final step is to "eat" the pork chop. So the next command is "eat pork chop."

Okay, let's try to figure out what's going on here. The user is trying to cook a meal in the kitchen. They've followed the recipe steps: took the cookbook, diced the pork chop with the knife, put it in the oven, took it out, and tried to serve it. But the system is rejecting some commands.

The last few attempts were trying to "roast pork chop" again, but the system says that's not a recognized verb. Maybe the correct command is different. Let me check the previous steps again. The user put the pork chop in the oven, so maybe the roasting is already done when it's in the oven. The recipe says "roast the pork chop," which might mean putting it in the oven. But the user already did that. So maybe the next step is to "prepare meal," but that was tried before. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "eat" the pork chop, but the system doesn't recognize "eat." Or perhaps the game expects a different verb like "cook" instead of "roast." But the recipe specifically says "roast."

Wait, the user has the pork chop in the oven, so maybe the roasting is already done. The next step is to prepare the meal, which might just be taking the cooked pork chop and serving it. But the system rejected "serve." Maybe the correct command is "eat pork chop" even if it's not a recognized verb. Alternatively, the game might require the user to "finish meal" or "complete meal." But the user is stuck here. Since the user is close to the goal, maybe the next action is to "eat pork chop" even if it's not recognized. Alternatively, the game might have a specific command like "serve" that's accepted. But the system says "serve" isn't a verb. Maybe the user needs to "prepare meal" again. But that was tried before. Hmm. The user is in the kitchen, has the pork chop, and the oven is open. The original goal was to enjoy the meal. Maybe the final step is to "eat" the pork chop. So the next command is "eat pork chop."
