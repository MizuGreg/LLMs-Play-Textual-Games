You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. A normal one. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop and a red onion! You can see a closed oven, which looks conventional, right there by you. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a knife. Hey, want to see a counter? Look over there, a counter. You see a yellow apple, a red apple, a green apple and a cookbook on the counter. You can see a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is an open frosted-glass door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in a kitchen game where they need to cook a meal. The goal is to follow the recipe from the cookbook. So far, they've looked at the cookbook, which had a recipe that mentions a pork chop. The ingredients in the fridge are a raw pork chop and a red onion. The user tried looking at the pork chop and red onion but couldn't eat them, which might mean they need to process them.

The recipe directions say to "dice the pork chop" and "roast the pork chop". The user has the pork chop in the fridge. So the next logical step would be to take the pork chop. Then, after dicing it, they need to roast it. But the oven is closed. So maybe they need to open the oven first. Wait, the user hasn't opened the oven yet. The oven is described as closed. So the steps would be: take the pork chop, dice it, then roast it in the oven. But the user hasn't opened the oven, so maybe the next action is to open the oven. Alternatively, maybe they need to take the pork chop first. Let me check the previous actions.

The user tried opening the cookbook, but it wasn't possible. Then they looked around, but there was no cookbook. Then they looked at the cookbook, which was possible. Then they looked at the pork chop and red onion. The recipe requires dicing the pork chop and roasting it. So the next step is probably to take the pork chop from the fridge. Because the user hasn't taken it yet. So the action would be to take the pork chop. Then, after dicing, they can roast it. But the oven is closed, so maybe after roasting, they need to open the oven. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the immediate next step is to take the pork chop. Let me check the available actions. The user is in the kitchen, with the fridge, oven, table, stove, etc. The pork chop is in the fridge. So the correct action is to take the pork chop from the fridge. Then proceed with dicing and roasting. So the next command should be "take pork chop".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal in the kitchen game. They have the pork chop and a knife. The recipe says to dice the pork chop. The user tried using the knife on the pork chop, but the system said that's not a verb recognized. So maybe the correct action is to use the knife to dice the pork chop. But the previous attempt was "use knife on pork chop", which didn't work. Maybe the correct command is "dice pork chop with knife" or something similar. Alternatively, maybe the system expects a different phrasing. Since the user has the knife on the table, they need to use it on the pork chop. The next step should be to dice the pork chop using the knife. So the command would be "dice pork chop" or "use knife on pork chop". But since the last attempt failed, maybe the correct command is "dice pork chop".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to dice the pork chop using the knife. The previous attempts to use the knife on the pork chop resulted in errors. The system says "That's not a verb I recognise" when trying to use the knife. Maybe the correct command is to use the knife on the pork chop, but the system isn't recognizing it. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to first take the knife from the table. Wait, the user is in the kitchen, and the knife is on the table. So perhaps the user needs to take the knife first, then use it on the pork chop. But the user hasn't taken the knife yet. Let me check the previous steps.

The user looked at the knife, but it was described as "out of place here". Then they tried using the knife on the pork chop, which didn't work. Maybe the correct action is to take the knife first. So the next step should be to take the knife from the table. Then, after taking the knife, use it on the pork chop. But the user hasn't taken the knife yet. So the correct command would be "take knife" first. Then "use knife on pork chop". But the user is stuck in a loop here. The system might expect a different command. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the knife on the pork chop without specifying the knife, but that's unclear. Since the user has the knife on the table, taking it first is necessary. So the next action should be "take knife".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to use the knife on the pork chop. The previous attempt resulted in an error. The system says "That's not a verb I recognise." So maybe the correct command is different. Instead of "use knife on pork chop", maybe it's "dice pork chop with knife" or "cut pork chop with knife". Alternatively, the game might expect a specific verb like "slice" or "chop". Since the recipe says "dice the pork chop", perhaps the correct action is to "dice pork chop". But the user tried that before and got the same error. Wait, maybe the knife is already in hand, so the command is just "dice pork chop". Let me check the previous steps. The user took the knife, so now they can use it. The correct command might be "dice pork chop" without specifying the knife, but the system doesn't recognize it. Alternatively, maybe "cut pork chop with knife". But the system says "That's not a verb I recognise." So perhaps the correct verb is "chop". Let me try "chop pork chop".
