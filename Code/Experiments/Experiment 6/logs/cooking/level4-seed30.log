You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Pantry =-
Ah, the pantry. This is some kind of pantry, really great standard vibes in this place, a wonderful standard atmosphere.

You scan the room, seeing a shelf. The shelf is wooden. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is an open plain door leading west.

-= Kitchen =-
You're not going to believe this, but you've just entered a kitchen.

You can make out an opened fridge. The fridge contains a carrot and an orange bell pepper. You can make out an oven. You check the price tag that's still affixed to the oven. 15 bucks? What a deal! You'll have to ask where they got this! You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a table. The table is massive. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a red hot pepper, a raw red tuna, a yellow bell pepper, a cookbook and a knife. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is an open plain door leading east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door.
