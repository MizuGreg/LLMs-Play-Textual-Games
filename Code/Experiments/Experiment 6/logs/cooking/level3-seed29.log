You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen.

You make out an opened fridge right there by you. The fridge contains a white onion, a lettuce, a raw white tuna and a red onion. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You make out an oven. You can see a table. The table appears to be empty. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a green apple, a green hot pepper, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a stove, go to TextWorld. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.
