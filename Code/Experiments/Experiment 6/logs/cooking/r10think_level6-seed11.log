You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Bedroom =-
If you're wondering why everything seems so standard all of a sudden, it's because you've just sauntered into the bedroom. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

Look over there! a bed. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Hm. Oh well

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they've been moving through different rooms: bedroom, living room, corridor, bathroom, and back and forth. The original goal was to cook a meal by checking the cookbook in the kitchen. But so far, the user has been moving between rooms without finding the kitchen.

Looking at the current location, they're in the corridor again. The corridor has exits to north, south, and west. The previous attempts to go east from the bathroom led back to the corridor. The user might be stuck in a loop between the corridor, bathroom, and living room/bedroom.

The key is to find the kitchen. The cookbook is in the kitchen. So the user needs to find the kitchen door. But in the current corridor, the exits are north, south, west. The user has tried going west (to bathroom) and east (which is blocked by a door, so they go back to corridor). Maybe the kitchen is in the north direction? But the north exit from the corridor is just another corridor. Wait, the user hasn't checked the north exit yet. Maybe the kitchen is north of the corridor. Alternatively, maybe the kitchen is in the west, but the west exit from the corridor leads to the bathroom, which is already been checked.

Wait, the user's previous moves: they went east from the bathroom to corridor, then west to bathroom again. So maybe the kitchen is in the north direction. But the north exit from the corridor is just another corridor. The user needs to find a way to get to the kitchen. Maybe the kitchen is in the north, but the user hasn't explored that yet. Alternatively, maybe the kitchen is in the west, but the west exit leads to the bathroom. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to find the kitchen through the living room. The living room has an exit to the north and west. The bedroom has an exit to the east. But the user hasn't checked the north exit from the living room. Maybe the kitchen is north of the living room. But the user is currently in the corridor. So perhaps the correct path is to go north from the corridor, then proceed through the corridor to the kitchen.

But the user is currently in the corridor, and the north exit is available. The user should try going north from the corridor. But the previous steps showed that when in the corridor, the user is told to try south or west. But maybe the north exit is the correct one. The user might have been following the advice to go south or west, but that's leading them in circles. So the correct action here is to go north from the corridor to find the kitchen.

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a fridge. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a red bell pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, a green bell pepper, a lettuce and a carrot. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You scan the room for a table, and you find a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a yellow apple, a raw purple potato, a tomato, a red apple, a raw red potato, a raw yellow potato, a green apple, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife. Were you looking for a stove? Because look over there, it's a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is an open frosted-glass door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in a text adventure game where their goal is to cook a meal by finding the cookbook in the kitchen. They've been moving through various rooms: bedroom, living room, corridor, bathroom, and back and forth. The kitchen was found earlier, but after opening the frosted-glass door west, they went to the pantry, then back to the kitchen, and now they're stuck again in the corridor.

The user is currently in the corridor again, with the same options: north, south, west. The previous attempts to go west led back to the bathroom, which then loops back to the corridor. The kitchen was already visited, and the pantry was checked but didn't have the cookbook. The cookbook was in the kitchen, but maybe the user didn't check the right place.

Wait, in the kitchen, the user saw a cookbook on the counter. So the cookbook is already there. The original goal was to "check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe." So maybe the user needs to pick up the cookbook from the kitchen counter. But in the previous steps, when they were in the kitchen, they didn't take the cookbook. So the next action should be to take the cookbook from the kitchen counter.

But the user's last action was going west from the corridor, leading back to the bathroom. Now, in the corridor again, the user needs to go north to the kitchen again. Once in the kitchen, they can take the cookbook. So the correct next step is to go north from the corridor to the kitchen, then take the cookbook.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the recipe from the cookbook to cook a meal. The recipe says to dice the orange bell pepper, fry it, then do the same with the purple potato and yellow apple. The user has already taken the cookbook and is now trying to follow the steps.

The user tried "dice the orange bell pepper" but got an error saying that's not a verb. Then they tried "use knife on orange bell pepper" which also didn't work. The system responded with "Cutting something requires a knife." So maybe the correct command is to use the knife on the orange bell pepper to dice it. But the user tried that again and got the same error. Wait, maybe the correct command is "cut the orange bell pepper with knife" or something similar. But the system might expect a different phrasing. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to first pick up the knife, then use it on the pepper. But the user hasn't picked up the knife yet. Wait, in the kitchen, the counter has a knife. So the user needs to take the knife first, then use it on the pepper. But the user's previous actions were trying to dice the pepper without using the knife. So the correct steps would be: take the knife, then use it on the pepper. But the user is getting errors because they're not using the correct command structure. The system might expect "use knife on orange bell pepper" but the user is getting an error. Alternatively, maybe the command is "cut orange bell pepper with knife". But the user has to follow the exact command syntax. Since the system said "Cutting something requires a knife," maybe the correct command is "cut orange bell pepper with knife". But the user tried "use knife on orange bell pepper" and it didn't work. Maybe the correct command is "cut the orange bell pepper" but that's not possible without the knife. So the user needs to first take the knife, then use it. But the user hasn't taken the knife yet. So the next step should be to take the knife from the counter, then use it on the pepper. But the user is stuck in the loop of trying to dice the pepper. So the correct action now is to take the knife first.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop where they keep trying to cut the orange bell pepper with the knife, but the game doesn't recognize the command. The previous attempts have all failed, and the system keeps saying it only understood the part about cutting the pepper. The user needs to find the correct command structure to make the game recognize their action.

Looking at the recipe, the first step is to dice the orange bell pepper. The user has the knife from the counter. The correct command might be "cut the orange bell pepper with the knife" or "dice the orange bell pepper with the knife." But the game is not accepting "cut" or "dice" in that context. Maybe the game expects a different verb, like "slice" or "chop." Alternatively, the user might need to use the knife on the pepper directly without specifying the action.

Another possibility is that the game requires the user to first pick up the orange bell pepper, but it's already in hand. Alternatively, the command might be "use knife on orange bell pepper" but that didn't work before. Wait, the user tried "use knife on orange bell pepper" and it didn't work. Maybe the correct command is "cut orange bell pepper with knife" without the "the." Or maybe the game expects "cut the orange bell pepper with the knife."

But the user has tried multiple variations and keeps getting the same error. The game might be expecting a different phrasing. Since the user is in the kitchen and has the knife and the pepper, the next step is to use the knife on the pepper to dice it. The correct command is likely "cut orange bell pepper with knife," but the game isn't recognizing it. Maybe the game expects "cut the orange bell pepper with the knife," but the user has to try it again.

Okay, the user is trying to follow the recipe from the cookbook to cook a meal. The recipe requires dicing the orange bell pepper, frying it, then doing the same with the purple potato and yellow apple. The user has already taken the knife from the counter but is having trouble using it correctly.

The previous attempts to use the knife on the orange bell pepper have failed because the commands like "use knife on orange bell pepper" or "use knife to dice orange bell pepper" aren't recognized. The system might expect a different phrasing. Maybe the correct command is "cut the orange bell pepper with the knife" or "dice the orange bell pepper with the knife." However, the user has to follow the exact command structure expected by the game.

Since the user has the knife and the orange bell pepper, the next step is to use the knife on the pepper to dice it. The correct command might be "cut orange bell pepper with knife" or "dice orange bell pepper with knife." But the user has tried "use knife on orange bell pepper" and it didn't work. Maybe the game expects the verb "cut" instead of "dice" here. Alternatively, the user might need to first pick up the pepper, but it's already in hand. 

Given the previous errors, the user should try using the knife to cut the pepper. The correct command is likely "cut orange bell pepper with knife," but the user has to try it.
