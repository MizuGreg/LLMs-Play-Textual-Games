Okay, let's see. The user is in a garden and has been picking up bell peppers. The goal is to cook a meal using the ingredients found here. So far, they've picked up the orange and yellow bell peppers. The cookbook is in the kitchen, so maybe they need to go get the recipe.

Wait, the current location is the garden. The exit is to the south, but the kitchen isn't mentioned here. Maybe the kitchen is another room. The user needs to check the cookbook in the kitchen. So the next step might be to go to the kitchen. But the user is currently in the garden. The exit to the south might lead to the kitchen. Let me check the previous messages.

In the initial description, the garden has an exit to the south. The user hasn't moved yet. The next action should be to go south to the kitchen. But the user has been picking up ingredients. Maybe they need to collect all the necessary items first. However, the recipe might require specific ingredients. Let me think about the ingredients available.

The garden has orange bell pepper, yellow bell pepper, tomato, white onion, red apple, purple potato, red hot pepper, red potato, and green hot pepper. The user has picked up two peppers. The recipe might need a variety of vegetables and spices. The next step could be to collect more ingredients or go to the kitchen to check the recipe.

But the user's score increased each time they picked up an item. The goal is to cook a meal, so maybe after collecting all needed ingredients, they need to go to the kitchen, check the recipe, and then cook. However, the user hasn't moved yet. The exit to the south is the only direction mentioned. So perhaps the next step is to go south to the kitchen. But the user hasn't done that yet. The previous actions were picking up items, but maybe they need to go to the kitchen first to find the recipe. Alternatively, maybe the kitchen is in the garden, but that's not clear.

Wait, the initial description says "Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe." So the user needs to go to the kitchen. The garden has an exit to the south. So the next action should be to go south to the kitchen. Then, once there, check the cookbook. But the user hasn't moved yet. The previous actions were picking up items. So maybe the next step is to go to the kitchen. But the user is in the garden. So the correct next action is to go south. But the user might need to collect all ingredients first. However, the user's score is increasing, so maybe they need to collect more items. But the goal is to cook, so perhaps after collecting the necessary items, they need to go to the kitchen.

But the user hasn't gone to the kitchen yet. The initial instruction says to check the cookbook in the kitchen. So the user needs to go to the kitchen. Therefore, the next action should be to go south to the kitchen. But the user is in the garden, so the exit to the south is the way to go. Therefore, the next command should be "go south".

-= Backyard =-
You arrive in a backyard. An ordinary one.

Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a patio chair. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a patio chair? The patio chair is stylish. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? Hey, want to see a patio table? Look over there, a patio table. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You make out a closed BBQ close by.

There is a closed patio door leading south. There is a closed wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user has been picking up items in the garden. They started with the orange and yellow bell peppers, then moved to the backyard, went north back to the garden, and now picked up a tomato. The goal is to cook a meal using the ingredients from the cookbook in the kitchen.

So far, they've collected orange bell pepper, yellow bell pepper, tomato, white onion, red apple, purple potato, red hot pepper, red potato, and green hot pepper. Wait, but in the current garden state, some items are missing. The current items listed are tomato, white onion, red apple, raw purple potato, red hot pepper, raw red potato, and green hot pepper. The orange and yellow bell peppers were picked up earlier but maybe they're not here anymore. Wait, the user picked up the orange and yellow bell peppers first, then moved to the backyard and back. So maybe those items are still in the inventory, but the garden now has different items on the floor.

The user's score is 1/6, but the initial score was 0, then each pick up adds a point. So after picking up the tomato, it's 1/6. But the original goal is to cook a meal, which requires following the cookbook's recipe. The user needs to collect all necessary ingredients, then go to the kitchen to check the recipe, then cook.

But the user is in the garden again. The exit to the south is there. The kitchen might be in the backyard or another direction. The user previously went south to the backyard, then north back to the garden. The next step might be to collect more ingredients. The current items on the floor are tomato, white onion, red apple, purple potato, red hot pepper, red potato, green hot pepper. The user has already picked up the tomato. So maybe they need to pick up the white onion next. But the user's next action would be to pick up the white onion. Alternatively, they might need to go to the kitchen to check the recipe. But the kitchen isn't in the current location. The user needs to find the kitchen. The backyard has a closed patio door south and a closed wooden door west. Maybe the kitchen is through one of those doors. But the user hasn't opened them yet. However, the user's previous action was going north, so they're back in the garden. The exit to the south is still there. Maybe the kitchen is south, but the user needs to go through the patio door. But the patio door is closed. So maybe the user needs to open it. But the game might not allow opening doors unless specified. Alternatively, the user might need to collect all ingredients first. The recipe might require specific items. The user has picked up tomato, orange bell pepper, yellow bell pepper, and now tomato. So maybe they need to collect more. The white onion is on the floor, so pick that up next. Then maybe go to the kitchen. But the user is in the garden. The next action should be to pick up the white onion. So the next command is pick up white onion.

Okay, let's see. The user has been picking up various items in the garden. They started with the orange and yellow bell peppers, then moved to the backyard and back. Now they've picked up the tomato, white onion, red apple, and raw purple potato. The score is now 2/9. The goal is to cook a meal using the cookbook in the kitchen.

The current items on the floor in the garden are tomato, white onion, red apple, raw purple potato, red hot pepper, raw red potato, and green hot pepper. The user has picked up the tomato, white onion, red apple, and purple potato. So the next items to pick up might be the red hot pepper, raw red potato, and green hot pepper. But the user needs to check the cookbook in the kitchen first. However, the user is currently in the garden. The exit to the south is there, but the kitchen isn't mentioned here. The previous move to the backyard had a patio door south and a wooden door west. Maybe the kitchen is through one of those doors. But the doors are closed. The user might need to open them, but the game might not allow that unless specified. Alternatively, the user might need to collect all ingredients first. The recipe might require specific combinations. The user has picked up several items, but maybe they need to go to the kitchen to check the recipe. However, the user is in the garden. The next step could be to go south to the backyard again, check the doors, and maybe find the kitchen. But the user's last action was picking up the purple potato, and the score increased. The next action should be to pick up the next available item, like the red hot pepper. So the next command is pick up red hot pepper.

Okay, let's recap. The user has been collecting ingredients in the garden. They picked up several items like bell peppers, tomato, onion, apple, potatoes, and hot peppers. Now, they're back in the garden again, but the red hot pepper is already in their inventory. The next step is to check the cookbook in the kitchen to find the recipe. But the user is in the garden. The exit to the south leads back to the backyard, which has a closed patio door and a wooden door. Maybe the kitchen is through one of those doors. However, the doors are closed, so the user might need to open them. But the game might not allow opening doors unless there's a command for it. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to collect all the ingredients first. The current items picked up include the necessary vegetables and spices. The recipe might require all these items. So the next action should be to go to the kitchen, check the cookbook, and then cook the meal. Since the user is in the garden, the exit to the south is the way to go. The previous attempt to go south led to the backyard, but the doors are closed. Maybe the user needs to find another way. Alternatively, maybe the kitchen is in the garden, but the user hasn't found it yet. The next step is to check the closed doors in the backyard. But since the user can't open them, maybe they need to find another way. Alternatively, the user might have already collected all the needed ingredients and can now proceed to cook. But the game requires checking the cookbook first. So the correct next action is to go to the kitchen, which might be through the patio door south in the backyard. But the door is closed. The user might need to open it, but the game might not have that command. Alternatively, the user might need to go north again. But the user is already in the garden. Maybe the next step is to check the inventory and see if all ingredients are collected. If so, then the user can proceed to cook. But the game might require the user to check the cookbook first. So the next action is to go to the kitchen, which is probably in the backyard. So the user should go south again to the backyard and try to open the doors. But the doors are closed. The user might need to find a way to open them. However, the game might not allow that. Alternatively, the user might need to proceed to cook once all ingredients are collected. Since the user has collected all the necessary items, the next step is to cook the meal. But the game requires checking the cookbook first.

Okay, let's see. The user has been collecting ingredients in the garden and backyard. They've picked up various vegetables and peppers. Now, they're in the backyard again, trying to find the kitchen. The goal is to cook a meal using the cookbook in the kitchen.

The user has already collected all the necessary ingredients: orange bell pepper, yellow bell pepper, tomato, white onion, red apple, raw purple potato, red hot pepper, raw red potato, green hot pepper. So they have all the items needed for the recipe. The next step is to access the kitchen to check the cookbook and then cook the meal.

In the backyard, there's a closed patio door south and a closed wooden door west. The user has been trying to go north, but that's not helpful. The patio door south might lead to the kitchen. Since the doors are closed, the user might need to open them. But the game doesn't have a command for opening doors unless specified. However, the user is in the backyard, and the kitchen is likely through one of these doors. The user needs to find a way to open the door to access the kitchen.

Alternatively, maybe the user can cook the meal without opening the door, but the game requires checking the cookbook first. So the next action should be to try opening the patio door south. But since the user can't open it, maybe they need to find another way. However, the user is stuck in the backyard, so the next logical step is to try opening the doors. The wooden door west might lead to the kitchen. But the user hasn't tried that yet. So the next action should be to go west through the wooden door. But the door is closed. The user might need to find a way to open it. However, the game might not allow that. Alternatively, the user might need to proceed to cook once all ingredients are collected, even if the door is closed. But the game requires the cookbook. So the correct next action is to go west to check the wooden door, hoping to find the kitchen. But the door is closed. The user might need to find a way to open it. However, the game might not have that command. So the next action is to go west.

Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? Hey, want to see a patio table? Look over there, a patio table. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You make out a closed BBQ close by.

There is a closed patio door leading south. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

Okay, let's see. The user has been collecting ingredients in the garden and backyard. They found a shed, opened a wooden door, and went back to the backyard. Now, they're in the backyard again, with the patio door south closed and the wooden door west open. The goal is to cook a meal using the cookbook in the kitchen.

The user needs to access the kitchen to check the cookbook. The shed was a detour. The backyard has a closed patio door south, which might lead to the kitchen. The user tried going west again but ended up back in the backyard. The next step is to go south through the closed patio door. But the door is closed, so the user needs to open it. However, the game might not have a command for opening doors unless specified. Alternatively, maybe the user can proceed to cook once all ingredients are collected, but the game requires checking the cookbook first. So the correct next action is to go south to the patio door and try to open it. But since the user can't open it, maybe they need to find another way. However, the user has all the ingredients, so the next step is to check the cookbook in the kitchen. The patio door south is the likely path. So the next command is to go south.

Okay, let's see. The user has been navigating through the garden, backyard, shed, and now the pantry. The goal is to cook a meal using the cookbook in the kitchen. They've collected various ingredients like peppers, tomatoes, onions, potatoes, etc. Now they're in the pantry, which has a shelf that's empty except for the door leading east.

The user needs to find the cookbook to proceed. They previously saw the cookbook in the kitchen. The pantry's shelf is empty, so maybe the cookbook is in the kitchen. The next step is to go back to the kitchen through the frosted-glass door. But the user is in the pantry, so they need to go east through the door. However, the user already opened the frosted-glass door in the kitchen and went through it to the pantry. Now, they need to return to the kitchen. The pantry has an open door east, which leads back to the kitchen. So the next action is to go east back to the kitchen, then check the cookbook.

Okay, the user has the cookbook and read the recipe. The recipe requires orange bell pepper, purple potato, and yellow apple. The user has all these ingredients in their inventory. The next step is to follow the directions: dice, grill, chop, grill, chop, grill, then prepare the meal. Since the user is in the kitchen, they need to interact with the stove or grill. The recipe mentions grilling, so the user should use the stove. The next action is to grill the orange bell pepper. But the user needs to check if the stove is available.

The kitchen has a stove, so the user needs to interact with it. The recipe says to grill the pepper, so the action might be to put the pepper on the stove. The correct command might be "put orange bell pepper on stove" or "stove orange bell pepper". Since the game expects a verb, perhaps "stove" is the correct action. Let me check the previous commands.

Alternatively, the user might need to use the oven. The kitchen has an oven. Maybe the correct verb is "put" or "place". The user tried "put orange bell pepper on stove" earlier, which worked. Then they tried "grill" again. Since the game doesn't recognize "grill", maybe the next step is to use the oven. The correct command might be "put orange bell pepper in oven". Let me check the previous commands. The user put the pepper on the stove, then tried to grill. Now, maybe the correct action is to use the oven. So the next command is "put orange bell pepper in oven".

Okay, the user took the orange bell pepper from the stove. Now they need to grill it according to the recipe. The previous attempt to grill failed, but maybe now that the pepper is taken, the next step is to grill it. The correct command might be "grill orange bell pepper" even if it's not recognized. Alternatively, use the oven again. The recipe says to grill, so maybe the correct action is "grill". Let's try that.

Okay, the user opened the oven. Now they need to put the orange bell pepper inside. The previous attempt to put it in the oven failed because the oven was closed, but now it's open. The correct command should be "put orange bell pepper in oven". Let me check if that's the right verb. The game might expect "put" as the verb. So the next action is to put the pepper in the oven.
