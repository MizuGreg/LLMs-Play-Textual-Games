Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is in this text-based game where they've been moving around different rooms: shed, backyard, corridor, bedroom, living room, bathroom, and back to the corridor and bedroom again. The original goal was to cook a meal by checking the cookbook in the kitchen.

So far, the player has been moving through the house, but all the rooms they've checked so far don't mention a kitchen. The shed had a toolbox and workbench, the backyard had a patio table and chair, the corridor, bedroom, living room, and bathroom. But no kitchen yet. The user is now back in the bedroom again, and the question is whether they're on the right track and if they're close to the goal.

Wait, the initial instruction said to check the cookbook in the kitchen. So the player needs to find the kitchen. But in the rooms they've explored so far, there's no mention of a kitchen. The shed's north door led to the backyard, then through the sliding door to the corridor, then to the bedroom, living room, bathroom, and back. Maybe the kitchen is in one of the other directions they haven't checked yet.

Looking at the current room: the bedroom has an exit to the east (no door) and south. The previous corridor had exits to north, east, west (no door), and south. The living room had exits to south and west. The bathroom had an exit to east. The backyard had a sliding door to the north and a barn door to the south. The shed had a barn door to the north.

Wait, maybe the kitchen is in the corridor's other exits? The corridor has an exit to the north, east, west (no door), and south. The player was in the corridor (0/13), then went north to the bedroom (0/14), then east to the living room (0/15), then west back to the bedroom (0/16). So the corridor's exits: north (bedroom), east (no door), west (no door), south (backyard). So maybe the kitchen is in the east exit of the corridor? But the east exit is labeled as "no door," so maybe it's a door they haven't opened yet? Or perhaps the kitchen is in another part of the house.

Alternatively, maybe the kitchen is in the backyard. The backyard had a closed BBQ. Maybe the BBQ is part of the kitchen area? Or perhaps the sliding patio door leading south from the corridor is the one to the backyard, but the player has already been there.

Wait, the user is now in the bedroom again. The previous steps have the player moving in a loop between the bedroom, corridor, living room, bathroom, etc. Maybe they need to check other exits. Let me check the rooms again.

In the corridor (0/13), the exits are: north (bedroom), east (no door), west (no door), south (backyard). The player was in the corridor, went north to bedroom, then east to living room, west back to bedroom. So maybe the east exit of the corridor is a door they haven't opened yet. But the description says "Don't worry, there is no door." So maybe it's not a door but another exit. Alternatively, maybe the kitchen is in the east exit of the corridor, but the player hasn't checked there yet.

Alternatively, maybe the kitchen is in the backyard. The backyard has a closed BBQ. Maybe the player needs to open the BBQ or check there. But the initial goal was to check the cookbook in the kitchen. So the player needs to find the kitchen.

Alternatively, maybe the kitchen is in the bathroom? But the bathroom has a toilet and no mention of a kitchen. The living room has a sofa but no kitchen. The bedroom has a bed. The shed has a toolbox. The backyard has a patio table and chair.

Wait, maybe the player missed a room. Let me check the rooms again. The shed, backyard, corridor, bedroom, living room, bathroom. Are there any other rooms? The initial shed had a barn door leading north. The backyard had a sliding patio door leading north. The corridor has exits to north, east, west, south. The bedroom has exits to east and south. The living room has exits to south and west. The bathroom has exit to east.

So maybe the kitchen is in the east exit of the corridor? But the description says "Don't worry, there is no door." So maybe it's a door that's closed, and the player needs to open it. But the player hasn't tried that yet. Alternatively, maybe the player needs to check the backyard's BBQ for something related to the kitchen.

Alternatively, maybe the player is supposed to go back to the shed and check the toolbox for a recipe? But the initial instruction said to check the cookbook in the kitchen. So the player needs to find the kitchen first.

So, the player is currently in the bedroom (0/16). The exits are east and south. The east exit leads to the living room (0/15), and the south exit leads to the corridor (0/13). But the player has been going in circles. Maybe the player needs to go back to the corridor and check the east exit, even though it's labeled as "no door." Maybe that's where the kitchen is.

Alternatively, maybe the player needs to check the backyard's BBQ. The backyard has a closed BBQ. Maybe the player needs to open it. But the initial goal is to find the cookbook in the kitchen. So perhaps the player needs to find the kitchen first.

In the current position (bedroom), the player can go east to the living room or south to the corridor. The living room has an exit to the west (back to bedroom) and south (no door). The corridor has exits to north (bedroom), east (no door), west (no door), south (backyard). The backyard has a sliding patio door leading north (to corridor) and a barn door leading south (to shed). The shed has a toolbox and workbench.

So, perhaps the player needs to go back to the corridor, then check the east exit, even though it's labeled as "no door." Maybe that's where the kitchen is. Alternatively, maybe the player needs to check the backyard's BBQ for something related to the kitchen.

But the original goal is to check the cookbook in the kitchen. So the player needs to find the kitchen. The player hasn't found it yet. The player is in the bedroom, so maybe the next step is to go back to the corridor and check the east exit, even though it's labeled as "no door." Or maybe the player needs to go to the backyard and check the BBQ for a clue.

Alternatively, maybe the player is supposed to check the shed's toolbox for the cookbook. But the initial instruction said to check the cookbook in the kitchen. So that's not the case.

So, the player is in the bedroom (0/16). The exits are east and south. The east exit leads to the living room (0/15), and the south exit leads to the corridor (0/13). The player has been going back and forth between these rooms. The player needs to find the kitchen.

Maybe the kitchen is in the corridor's east exit. So the player should go back to the corridor, then go east. Even though the description says "Don't worry, there is no door," maybe that's a clue that the kitchen is there. So the next action would be to go east from the corridor.

-= Kitchen =-
Well, here we are in a kitchen. You can barely contain your excitement.

A closed conventional looking fridge is nearby. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You scan the room for a table, and you find a table. Now why would someone leave that there? The table is massive. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Sometimes, just sometimes, TextWorld can just be the worst. You see a counter! The counter is vast. On the counter you see a yellow apple, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife. Wow! Just like in the movies! You make out a stove. But the thing is empty.

There is a closed plain door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one. There is an exit to the west.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal as per the recipe in the cookbook they found in the kitchen. The recipe requires gathering three ingredients: green hot pepper, red onion, and white onion. But in the kitchen scene, the user saw a yellow apple, a red hot pepper, a cookbook, and a knife. The stove is empty.

Wait, the user might have misread the ingredients. The recipe says "green hot pepper," "red onion," and "white onion." But in the kitchen, there's a "red hot pepper" and maybe the user is confused between "red onion" and "red hot pepper." Also, the white onion might be present but not mentioned. The user tried to take the red hot pepper but couldn't because it's not there. The actual ingredients might be different.

The user is stuck because they can't find the required items. The recipe might have typos or the items might be named differently. The user needs to check the kitchen again for the correct ingredients. Maybe the red onion is actually the red hot pepper, or the green hot pepper is a different item. Alternatively, the user might need to use the knife to prepare the ingredients even if they can't take them. But according to the game's rules, the user has to take the items first. Since the user can't find the required items, they might need to look again or realize the ingredients are different. The next step should be to check the kitchen again for the correct items, perhaps using the knife to prepare them if they're present.

Okay, the user is trying to use the knife on the red hot pepper, but the game doesn't recognize that as a valid action. The previous attempts to take the red onion and white onion failed. The recipe requires green hot pepper, red onion, and white onion, but the kitchen only has a red hot pepper. Maybe the user needs to proceed with the available ingredient and assume the recipe's names are incorrect. Alternatively, the user might need to cook the red hot pepper as a substitute. Since the game doesn't allow using the knife on the pepper, the next step might be to try cooking the pepper directly. But the correct command might be "cook red hot pepper" instead of using the knife. However, the game's response indicates that "use knife on" is invalid. So, the user should try a different command related to cooking the available ingredient.

Okay, the user is trying to cook the red hot pepper but keeps getting errors. The game doesn't recognize "fry" as a verb here. Maybe the correct action is to use the stove. The recipe says to "fry the green hot pepper" and "fry the white onion," but the user has the red hot pepper. Since the stove is empty, maybe the user needs to put the pepper on the stove. The correct command might be "put red hot pepper on stove" or "fry red hot pepper on stove." But the game's previous response said "fry red hot pepper" isn't valid. Alternatively, the user might need to use the knife to cut the pepper first. But the knife wasn't used correctly before. Maybe the right command is "slice red hot pepper" to prepare it for frying. Let's try that.
