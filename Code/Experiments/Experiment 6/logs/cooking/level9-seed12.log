You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Backyard =-
Guess what, you are in a place we're calling a backyard. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a patio table. The patio table is stylish. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a patio chair. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make out a closed BBQ in the room.

There is a closed wooden door leading east. There is a closed screen door leading west. There is an exit to the north.

You make out a closed BBQ in the room.

There is an open wooden door leading east. There is a closed screen door leading west. There is an exit to the north.

You can make out a toolbox. You can see a workbench. But there isn't a thing on it. What's the point of an empty workbench?

There is an open wooden door leading west.

-= Backyard =-
Guess what, you are in a place we're calling a backyard. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a patio table. The patio table is stylish. On the patio table you can make out a lettuce and a tomato. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a patio chair. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make out a closed BBQ in the room.

There is an open wooden door leading east. There is a closed screen door leading west. There is an exit to the north.

You arrive in a garden. A normal one. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.



You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.
