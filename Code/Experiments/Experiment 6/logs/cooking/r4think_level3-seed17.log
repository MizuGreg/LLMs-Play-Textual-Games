You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. A normal one.

You see a fridge. The fridge contains a red onion, a raw pork chop, a raw white tuna, a red bell pepper, a yellow onion, a white onion and a raw red tuna. You can see a closed oven. You scan the room, seeing a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. You scan the room for a counter, and you find a counter. On the counter you can make out a raw yellow potato. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You smell an intriguing smell, and follow it to a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal in the kitchen. The goal is to find a recipe in the cookbook and then cook something. So far, they checked the cookbook but couldn't open it. Then they looked around, under the table, under the counter, in the fridge, and the oven. The fridge has some ingredients, but the oven is closed.

The user is asking if they're making the right actions and if they're close to the goal. Let me think. The cookbook is on the table, but it wasn't openable. Maybe the user needs to find a way to open it. Alternatively, maybe they can use the ingredients from the fridge and the stove to cook something. The stove is empty, but maybe they can use the ingredients to make a dish. The cookbook might have the recipe, but since it's closed, maybe they need to find a way to open it. Alternatively, maybe the user can use the ingredients to make a meal without the cookbook? But the initial instruction says to check the cookbook for the recipe. So the key is to open the cookbook. But the user tried looking around and didn't find it. Wait, the cookbook is on the table. The user first tried to open it but couldn't. Maybe the cookbook is a book that needs to be opened, like a regular book. So maybe the next step is to try opening it again, or perhaps there's a way to use the ingredients to cook something. But the user needs to follow the recipe from the cookbook. So maybe the user needs to find a way to open the cookbook first. Alternatively, maybe the user can use the ingredients to make a meal, but the recipe is in the cookbook. So the next step is to try opening the cookbook again. But the user already tried that. Wait, the user's last action was looking in the oven, which was closed. So maybe the next step is to open the oven? But the user's goal is to cook, so maybe they need to use the stove. The stove is empty, so maybe they can put ingredients into it. But the user needs the recipe. So perhaps the next action is to try opening the cookbook again, or maybe look for another way to get the recipe. Alternatively, maybe the user can use the ingredients from the fridge to make a dish, but the recipe is in the cookbook. So the user needs to open the cookbook to get the recipe. Therefore, the next action should be to try opening the cookbook again. But the user already tried that. Wait, the user's first action was to open the cookbook, but it wasn't possible. Then they looked around, under the table, under the counter, in the fridge, and the oven. Now, maybe the user needs to check the table again where the cookbook is. Maybe the cookbook is on the table, and the user needs to pick it up and open it. So the next action would be to pick up the cookbook, then open it. But the user hasn't picked it up yet. So the next step is to take the cookbook from the table. Then open it. So the next action is to take the cookbook.

Okay, let's see. The user has the cookbook open now, and the recipe is for a meal that requires pork chop, red onion, and white tuna. The directions say to dice the pork chop, fry it, then do the same with the red onion and white tuna. So the next step is to gather those ingredients. The user already has the ingredients in the fridge. The ingredients are pork chop, red onion, and white tuna. So the user needs to take those ingredients from the fridge. The next action should be to take the pork chop from the fridge. Then take the red onion and white tuna. But the user can only take one item at a time. So first, take the pork chop.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to dice the pork chop but can't find the knife. Wait, the knife is on the table. They might have missed it earlier. So the next step is to take the knife from the table. Then use it to dice the pork chop. But the user tried to use the knife and got an error. Maybe the knife is not picked up yet. So first, take the knife, then dice the pork chop.

Wait, the user's last action was "use knife", but they can't see the knife. So maybe the knife is on the table. The user needs to take the knife first. So the correct sequence is: take knife, then use it to dice the pork chop. But the user hasn't taken the knife yet. So the next action should be to take the knife from the table.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook the meal according to the recipe. They have the ingredients: pork chop, red onion, and white tuna. They have the knife. The recipe says to dice the pork chop, fry it, then do the same with the red onion and white tuna. The user tried to use the knife on the pork chop but got an error. The last action was "dice pork chop", which didn't work.

Maybe the correct command is to "cut" the pork chop with the knife. Alternatively, "dice" might require the knife to be used properly. Since the user has the knife, they need to use it to dice the pork chop. The error might be because the command is not recognized. Maybe the correct verb is "cut" instead of "dice". Let me try "cut pork chop with knife" but the game might expect a different format. Alternatively, "dice" is the correct verb, but the user needs to specify using the knife. So the next action should be "dice pork chop" again, but maybe the game expects the knife to be used. Wait, the user already took the knife. So the correct action is to dice the pork chop with the knife. The previous attempt was "dice pork chop", which didn't work. Maybe the correct command is "cut pork chop with knife". But the game might not recognize that. Alternatively, the user needs to use the knife on the pork chop. So the next action is "use knife on pork chop". But the user tried that before and got an error. Hmm. Maybe the correct action is "dice pork chop" again, but the game is expecting a different input. Alternatively, the user needs to "cut" the pork chop. Let me try "cut pork chop".

Okay, the user is trying to fry the pork chop but keeps getting errors. Let me check the available commands. The user has the pork chop and the knife. The recipe says to fry the pork chop after dicing. The stove is in the kitchen. The correct command should be to use the stove to fry the pork chop. But the available commands don't have a direct "fry" action. Maybe the user needs to use the stove's function. The command might be "use stove on pork chop" or "fry pork chop with stove".

You are in a kitchen. A normal one.

You see a fridge. The fridge contains a red bell pepper, a yellow onion, a white onion and a raw red tuna. You can see a closed oven. You scan the room, seeing a table. But the thing is empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You scan the room for a counter, and you find a counter. On the counter you can make out a raw yellow potato. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You smell an intriguing smell, and follow it to a stove. On the stove you can see a diced raw pork chop. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing.

Okay, the user has put the pork chop on the stove. The next step according to the recipe is to fry it. But the available commands don't have a "fry" action. The user might need to use the stove's function. Since the stove is there, maybe the correct command is to "use stove on pork chop" or "fry pork chop with stove". But the game's commands don't recognize "fry". Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "cook" the pork chop. But "cook" isn't a valid command either. The available commands include "use" but the user can't see any objects to use. Wait, the stove is on the counter. Maybe the user needs to "use stove" to start cooking. But the recipe says to fry the pork chop. Since the user has the pork chop on the stove, maybe the next step is to "cook" it. But the command isn't recognized. Alternatively, the user might need to "turn on" the stove. But the game's commands don't have that. The correct action might be to "use stove" to cook the pork chop. Let me try that.

Okay, the user has taken the pork chop from the stove. Now, according to the recipe, they need to fry it. But the previous attempts to use the stove didn't work. The user might need to use the correct command structure. The available commands include "use" but the user needs to specify the object and the action. Maybe the correct command is "fry pork chop with stove" but the game doesn't recognize it. Alternatively, the user needs to "cook" the pork chop. Since the user has the pork chop, maybe the next step is to "cook" it. But the command isn't recognized. The user might need to use the stove's function again. Let me try "use stove to cook pork chop".

Okay, the user successfully fried the pork chop. Now, according to the recipe, the next step is to chop the red onion. The user has the red onion in their inventory. So the next action should be to chop the red onion using the knife. The command would be "dice red onion" or "chop red onion". Since the user already used the knife to dice the pork chop, they can use it again for the onion. Let's try "dice red onion".
