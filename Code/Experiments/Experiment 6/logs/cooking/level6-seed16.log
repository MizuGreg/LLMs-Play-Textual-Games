You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Pantry =-
Ah, the pantry. This is some kind of pantry, really great normal vibes in this place, a wonderful normal atmosphere. You can barely contain your excitement.

You can make out a shelf. The shelf is wooden. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm. Oh well

There is an open frosted-glass door leading west.

-= Kitchen =-
You've seen better kitchens, but at least this one seems pretty usual.

You can see an opened fridge in the room. The fridge contains a raw red tuna, an orange bell pepper, a red hot pepper, a red apple and a raw white tuna. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out an oven. You can see a table. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. You see a raw red potato, a red bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a tomato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty. Hm. Oh well

There is an open frosted-glass door leading east. There is an exit to the north.
