You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
Ah, the kitchen. This is some kind of kitchen, really great usual vibes in this place, a wonderful usual atmosphere.

You scan the room, seeing a fridge. The fridge contains a red onion, a white onion, a carrot, a raw red potato, a raw white tuna, a raw pork chop, a block of cheese and a yellow onion. What's that over there? It looks like it's an oven. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You can see a table. But there isn't a thing on it. You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper, a tomato, a red apple, a red bell pepper, a cookbook and a knife. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!
