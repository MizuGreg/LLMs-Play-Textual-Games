You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Bathroom =-
You've just sauntered into a bathroom.

If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a toilet. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door.

>                                                                                                                                -= Bathroom =-0/1

-= Corridor =-
You arrive in a corridor. A standard one. Let's see what's in here.



You need an exit without a door? You should try going east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.

-= Livingroom =-
Well, here we are in the livingroom.

You can make out a sofa. You shudder, but continue examining the sofa. The sofa is comfy. But the thing is empty.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.



>                                                                                                                                -= Livingroom =-0/3

-= Kitchen =-
You've just shown up in a kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.

Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a fridge! The fridge contains a raw pork chop and a lettuce! You see an oven. You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a knife. You can see a counter. On the counter you see a cookbook. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it. You swear loudly.

There is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an exit to the west.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is in a text-based game where they need to cook a meal by checking the cookbook in the kitchen. The previous interactions show that the user has been moving through different rooms: bathroom, corridor, living room, and now the kitchen. In the kitchen, there's a fridge with raw pork chop and lettuce, an oven, a table with a knife, a counter with a cookbook, and a stove. The user tried to open a frosted-glass door north but the system kept repeating the same response, indicating that the door might not be openable that way.

Wait, the user's last action was "open frosted-glass door north," but the system kept saying it only understood up to that point. Maybe the door isn't actually there, or the correct action is different. Let me check the kitchen description again. The kitchen has an open frosted-glass door leading north. So maybe the user is supposed to open that door, but the system is confused because the door is already open? Or perhaps the door is a window or something else.

The original goal is to cook a meal by checking the cookbook. The user is in the kitchen, which has the cookbook on the counter. So maybe the next step is to take the cookbook, then go to the oven or stove to cook the pork chop and lettuce. But the user is stuck trying to open the door. Maybe the door is a red herring, and the user should just take the cookbook and proceed to cook.

Alternatively, maybe the door is leading to another room where the cookbook is, but the user already has the cookbook in the kitchen. The user needs to use the ingredients from the fridge and the knife to prepare the meal. So the correct action would be to take the cookbook, then use the ingredients to cook. But the user is focused on opening the door, which might not be necessary. The system might be testing if the user can proceed without unnecessary actions.

So the next action should be to take the cookbook from the counter, then proceed to cook the meal using the ingredients. But the user's previous actions were all about opening the door, which might not be the right path. The user needs to realize that the cookbook is already in the kitchen and move on to cooking.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal in a text-based game. They've been moving through different rooms, finally reaching the kitchen where they found a cookbook, a fridge with ingredients, and a stove. The goal is to use the cookbook to cook the pork chop and lettuce.

The user tried to open a door multiple times, but that wasn't necessary since the cookbook was already in the kitchen. Then they took the pork chop from the fridge. The next step was trying to cook it, but the system kept rejecting the commands. The user tried various phrases like "cook pork chop with cookbook" and "use stove to cook," but the system didn't recognize them.

Now, the user is stuck again, trying to get the command right. The correct action should be to use the stove and the cookbook to cook the pork chop. The previous attempts used "cook" with "on stove using cookbook," but the system didn't accept it. Maybe the correct syntax is "cook pork chop on stove with cookbook" or similar. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to first use the cookbook to prepare the recipe, then use the stove to cook it.

Since the system is strict with verbs, the correct command might be "cook pork chop on stove" after using the cookbook. But the user needs to make sure the objects are in the right order. The last attempt was "cook pork chop on stove using cookbook," which the system didn't recognize. Maybe the correct command is "use cookbook to cook pork chop on stove." But the user has to use the right verbs. The correct action is probably "cook pork chop on stove" after taking the cookbook and pork chop. But the system is rejecting it. Maybe the user needs to use "use" instead of "cook" with the stove. Alternatively, the correct command is "cook pork chop with stove and cookbook." But the system might require a specific phrase. The user needs to try "cook pork chop on stove" without the cookbook part, but that's not correct. Alternatively, "use stove to cook pork chop with cookbook." But the system says that's not a verb. Hmm. The correct action is likely "cook pork chop on stove" but the system is not accepting it. Maybe the user should try "use stove to cook pork chop" after using the cookbook. But the user has to follow the correct syntax. The correct command is probably "cook pork chop on stove" but the system is not recognizing it. The user needs to try again with the correct verb.
