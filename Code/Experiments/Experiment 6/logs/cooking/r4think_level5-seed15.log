You are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You can make out an opened fridge, which looks conventional, nearby. The fridge contains a raw white tuna, a white onion, a raw pork chop and a yellow onion! You see an oven. You see a table. You wonder idly who left that here. The table is massive. But the thing is empty. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. There's something about an object in a room that's just so... TextWorld. You see a red hot pepper, a raw red tuna, a red bell pepper, a green hot pepper, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is an open frosted-glass door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they need to cook a meal using the ingredients from the cookbook. So far, they've checked the kitchen and found the cookbook. The recipe mentioned requires a red hot pepper and white tuna. The directions say to slice the red hot pepper, fry it, then slice and roast the white tuna. 

The user's current location is the kitchen, and they just looked at the cookbook. The next step would be to gather the ingredients. They need to find the red hot pepper and white tuna. Let me check the kitchen description again. The counter has a red hot pepper, a raw white tuna, and other items. So the user should pick up the red hot pepper first.

Wait, the user hasn't picked up any ingredients yet. The recipe starts with gathering the ingredients. So the next action should be to take the red hot pepper. Then maybe take the white tuna. But the user has to follow the steps in order. The directions say to slice the red hot pepper first. So maybe after taking it, they need to slice it. But in the game, the actions are limited to moving and interacting with objects. So the user needs to take the red hot pepper first. Then, perhaps, slice it. But the game might require specific commands like "slice red hot pepper" once it's in hand.

But the user's last action was looking at the cookbook. Now, they need to take the red hot pepper from the counter. So the next command should be "take red hot pepper". Then, after taking it, they can slice it. But the user has to do each step one by one. So the immediate next action is to take the red hot pepper.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to slice the red hot pepper, but they need a tool to do it. The available items in the kitchen are a knife on the counter. Wait, the user already took the red hot pepper, but maybe the knife is still there. The previous action was "slice red hot pepper", and the game asked for the tool. The user tried "use knife", but it didn't work. Maybe the knife isn't in the right place or not picked up yet. Let me check the kitchen description again. The counter has a knife. So the user needs to take the knife first. Then, use it to slice the pepper. So the next step is to take the knife from the counter.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to use the knife on the red hot pepper. The game said that's not a recognized verb. So maybe the correct command is to slice the red hot pepper with the knife. But earlier, when they tried "slice red hot pepper", they were asked to use a tool. Now, after taking the knife, they need to use it. The correct command might be "slice red hot pepper with knife" or "use knife on red hot pepper". But the game might expect a specific syntax. Alternatively, maybe "cut red hot pepper with knife". Let me think about the possible commands. The user has the knife and the pepper. The previous error was when they tried "use knife on red hot pepper", which didn't work. Maybe the correct command is "slice red hot pepper" again, and the game will now recognize that the knife is available. Or perhaps "cut red hot pepper with knife". But the user needs to follow the game's expected commands. Since the user previously tried "slice" and then "use knife", maybe the next step is to try "cut" instead of "slice". Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "slice red hot pepper" again, assuming the knife is now in hand. Let me check the previous steps. The user took the knife, so maybe the correct action is to slice the pepper with the knife. The game might accept "slice red hot pepper" again. Alternatively, "cut red hot pepper with knife". But the user has to input the correct command. Since the game said "use knife on red hot pepper" wasn't valid, maybe the correct command is "slice red hot pepper" again. Let me go with that.

Okay, the user is trying to fry the red hot pepper. The game keeps saying that's not a recognized verb. Let me think about the possible commands. The user has the knife and the red hot pepper. The previous steps were slicing the pepper. Now, they need to fry it. Maybe the correct command is "put red hot pepper on stove" or "place red hot pepper on stove". Alternatively, "fry red hot pepper" might require using the stove. But the game might expect a specific action. Since the user tried "fry red hot pepper with stove" and it didn't work, maybe the correct command is "put red hot pepper on stove". Let me check the kitchen description again. The stove is present but empty. So the user needs to place the pepper on the stove. The next action should be putting the pepper on the stove. Then, maybe the game will recognize that as frying.

Okay, the user is trying to cook the white tuna. They put it in the oven, but then had to take it out again. Now they need to wait for the oven to heat up. The previous steps show that the user has the white tuna. The next logical step is to wait for the oven to roast the tuna. The correct command would be "wait for oven to roast white tuna" or something similar. But the game might expect a specific phrase. Since the user tried "wait for oven to heat up" and it didn't work, maybe the correct command is "wait for oven to roast white tuna". Alternatively, "roast white tuna in oven". Let me check the previous interactions. The user has the white tuna, so the next step is to roast it. The correct command is likely "roast white tuna in oven".

Okay, the user is stuck again. They tried to roast the white tuna but the game says "roast" isn't a recognized verb. Let me think about the possible commands. The recipe says to "roast the white tuna". Maybe the correct command is "put white tuna in oven" again, but the user already did that. Wait, the oven is open, and the white tuna is inside. Maybe the next step is to wait for it to roast. The game might expect "wait for oven to roast white tuna" or "wait". But the user tried "wait for oven to heat up" before. Maybe the correct command is just "wait". Let me check the previous steps. The user put the tuna in the oven, opened it, took it out, and now needs to wait. The correct action is probably "wait" without any additional text. So the next command should be "wait".

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, the user is trying to cook the meal according to the recipe. They've followed the steps: sliced the red hot pepper, fried it, sliced the white tuna, and put it in the oven. Now, after waiting, they need to prepare the meal. The next step would be to combine the cooked ingredients. Since the recipe says "prepare meal", maybe the correct command is to eat the prepared dishes. The user has the red hot pepper and white tuna, which are now cooked. So the next action is to eat them. The command would be "eat red hot pepper" and "eat white tuna". But the game might require eating both together. Alternatively, the recipe might require combining them. But the user needs to follow the steps. The correct command is likely "eat red hot pepper" and "eat white tuna" separately. However, the game might have a specific command. Let me check the available commands. The user can eat edible food, so "eat red hot pepper" and "eat white tuna" are options. Since the user is close to the goal, the next step is to eat the cooked items.
