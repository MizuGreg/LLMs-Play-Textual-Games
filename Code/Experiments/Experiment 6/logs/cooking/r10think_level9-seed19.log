You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Corridor =-
You arrive in a corridor. A normal kind of place. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.



There is an exit to the east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me think through this. The user is in a text-based game where they need to cook a meal using the cookbook found in the kitchen. So far, they've navigated through the corridor, bathroom, and back to the kitchen where they took the cookbook. Now they're back in the corridor again, having gone north to the bathroom and then south back to the corridor.

The main goal is to cook a delicious meal, which requires accessing the cookbook's recipe. The user has the cookbook, so the next step is to use it. But in the current location (corridor), they can't directly access the kitchen again. Wait, the kitchen has a closed sliding patio door south and a closed plain door west. But the user is in the corridor, which is connected to the kitchen via the south direction (since the kitchen's south door is closed, but the corridor's south exit is open? Wait, the previous steps: when in the kitchen, the user went east, then north to bathroom, then south back to corridor. So the corridor's south exit leads back to the kitchen? Or is the kitchen's south door the patio door?

Wait, in the kitchen description, there's a closed sliding patio door leading south. So the kitchen is connected to the corridor via that door. But the user is currently in the corridor. To get back to the kitchen, they need to go south. But the kitchen's south door is closed. However, the user might have already been there. Wait, the user took the cookbook in the kitchen, then went east, north, south back to corridor. Now, they are in the corridor again. To get back to the kitchen, they need to go south, but the door is closed. But maybe the user can open it? Or perhaps there's another way.

But the user's current location is the corridor. The previous action was going north to the bathroom, then south back to corridor. Now, they need to get back to the kitchen to use the cookbook. But the kitchen's south door is closed. However, the user might have already been there. Wait, the user took the cookbook in the kitchen, so they must have been in the kitchen. Then they went east, north, south back to corridor. So now, to get back to the kitchen, they need to go south again, but the door is closed. But maybe the user can open it? Or maybe there's another way.

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to use the cookbook in the kitchen. But the user is in the corridor now. So the next step is to go back to the kitchen, open the door, and then use the cookbook. But the user hasn't used the cookbook yet. The previous action was taking the cookbook from the table in the kitchen. So the user has the cookbook, but needs to use it. However, the user is in the corridor now. So the next step is to go back to the kitchen, open the door, and then proceed to cook.

But the user is in the corridor, and the kitchen's south door is closed. So the user needs to go south to the kitchen, but the door is closed. However, the user might have already been there. Wait, the user is in the corridor, and the kitchen is connected via the south door. So the user needs to go south to enter the kitchen again. But the door is closed. So the user needs to open it. But how? The user hasn't interacted with the door yet. So maybe the next step is to go south to the kitchen, then open the door. But the user is in the corridor, so the next action is to go south to the kitchen, then open the door. But the user is in the corridor, so the next command is "go south" to enter the kitchen again. However, the door is closed, so they need to open it. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the user needs to go south, then open the door. But the user is in the corridor, so the next step is to go south to the kitchen. Then, once in the kitchen, open the door (but the door is already closed, but maybe the user can open it). Wait, the kitchen's south door is closed, but the user is in the corridor. So to get into the kitchen, they need to go south, but the door is closed. So the user needs to open it. But how? The user might need to open the door to enter the kitchen. However, the user is in the corridor, so the next action is to go south, but the door is closed. So the user needs to open it. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the user should go south to the kitchen, then open the door. But the user is in the corridor, so the next step is to go south. Then, once in the kitchen, open the door (but the door is already closed, so maybe the user can open it). But the user is in the kitchen, so maybe they can use the cookbook now. Wait, the user already took the cookbook from the kitchen. So maybe the user is in the corridor, and needs to go back to the kitchen to use the cookbook. But the user has the cookbook, so perhaps the next step is to go back to the kitchen, then use the cookbook. But the user is in the corridor, so the next action is to go south to the kitchen. Then, once in the kitchen, the user can use the cookbook. But the user is in the corridor, so the next command is "go south" to enter the kitchen again. Then, once in the kitchen, the user can proceed to cook. So the next action is "go south".

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is in a text-based game where the goal is to cook a meal using a cookbook found in the kitchen. So far, they've navigated through several rooms: corridor, bathroom, kitchen, backyard, and garden. In the garden, they've picked up a green bell pepper, a raw purple potato, and a green apple. They've also taken the cookbook from the kitchen earlier.

The next step would be to use the ingredients collected in the garden to cook a meal. The cookbook likely has a recipe that uses these items. Since the user has the cookbook, they might need to refer to it to find the correct recipe. But in the current location (garden), they need to get back to the kitchen to use the stove or oven mentioned earlier.

Wait, the user is in the garden. The kitchen is connected via the patio door (south from the kitchen). But the user is in the garden, which is connected to the backyard via the west direction. The backyard has a patio door leading north back to the kitchen. So the user needs to go back to the kitchen to cook.

But the user has already taken the cookbook, so maybe they need to go back to the kitchen, then use the ingredients from the garden to cook. The next action should be to go back to the kitchen. However, the user is in the garden, so the command would be "go north" to reach the backyard, then "go north" again to the kitchen. Alternatively, maybe there's a direct path.

Looking at the current location: Garden. The exit is east, but the user is in the garden. The previous location was the backyard, which has an exit to the east (garden) and a closed door south. So from the garden, going east would take them back to the backyard, but they need to get to the kitchen. Wait, the backyard has a patio door leading north to the kitchen. So from the garden, the user would need to go west to the backyard, then north to the kitchen.

But the user is in the garden. The current description says there's an exit to the east. So maybe the user needs to go west to the backyard, then north to the kitchen. But the user's last action was taking the green apple in the garden. Now, they need to get back to the kitchen to cook. So the next step is to go west to the backyard, then north to the kitchen. But the user is in the garden, so the first command would be "go west" to the backyard. Then, from the backyard, "go north" to the kitchen.

But the user is in the garden, and the current prompt shows the garden's description. The user needs to move to the backyard first. So the next action is "go west" to the backyard. Then, from the backyard, go north to the kitchen. Once in the kitchen, they can use the stove or oven and the ingredients to cook the meal. The cookbook would be in the kitchen, so they can refer to it for the recipe.

Alternatively, maybe the user can cook in the garden, but the kitchen is where the cooking equipment is. So the correct path is to go back to the kitchen. Therefore, the next command is "go west" to the backyard, then "go north" to the kitchen. But the user is in the garden, so the first step is "go west".

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user has the green bell pepper, raw purple potato, and green apple from the garden. But the cookbook recipe requires a block of cheese, green bell pepper, and red tuna. The user has the green bell pepper but needs the other two ingredients. They have a potato and an apple, which aren't in the recipe. So they need to find block of cheese and red tuna.

Looking around the kitchen, there's a fridge. Maybe the block of cheese is in the fridge. The user should check the fridge. Also, the recipe mentions red tuna, which might be in the fridge or another location. The user needs to open the fridge to look inside. So the next step is to open the fridge to find the required ingredients.

You open the fridge, revealing a block of cheese, a raw red tuna, a yellow onion, a red apple and a raw white tuna.
