You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.

You see an opened fridge, which looks conventional, nearby. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper. You make out a closed oven right there by you. Look over there! a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Look over there! a counter. You see a raw yellow potato, a yellow apple, a raw red potato, a banana, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty. You move on, clearly depressed by your TextWorld experience.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal in the kitchen. They found the cookbook, put it in the oven, but the oven isn't heating. The previous attempts to heat the oven didn't work. The user is asking if they're on the right track and what the next step should be.

First, I need to recall the game's environment. The kitchen has a fridge with a bell pepper, a closed oven, a table (but it's empty), a counter with ingredients like potatoes, apples, a banana, and a knife. There's also a stove, but it's empty. The user has the cookbook, which is essential for the recipe.

The user tried to heat the oven but got errors. The correct command might be "preheat oven" but that wasn't recognized. Maybe the correct verb is "heat oven" but the system didn't accept it. Alternatively, maybe the oven needs to be opened first? Wait, the user already opened the oven earlier. Or perhaps the oven is already preheated? But the user needs to follow the recipe steps.

The recipe would likely require preheating the oven to a certain temperature. Since the user has the cookbook, they need to check the recipe's instructions. The cookbook is in the oven, so maybe they need to take it out and follow the steps. But the user is stuck on heating the oven.

Alternatively, maybe the stove is the right place to heat something. The stove is empty, so maybe they need to use the stove instead of the oven. But the recipe might require the oven. The user might need to check the cookbook's recipe to see if it's for the oven or stove.

Wait, the user's goal is to cook a meal. The cookbook is in the oven, but the oven isn't working. Maybe the next step is to check the recipe in the cookbook to see what's needed. But the user has the cookbook in the oven. So they need to take it out. But the oven is closed. Wait, the user opened the oven earlier. So maybe they need to take the cookbook out of the oven, then check the recipe. But the user's last action was putting the cookbook in the oven. So maybe the next step is to take it out.

Alternatively, maybe the oven needs to be preheated. The user tried "heat oven" and "preheat oven", but the system didn't recognize them. Maybe the correct command is "preheat oven to 180 degrees" or something similar. But the game might have specific verbs. Since the user is stuck, maybe the next step is to check the recipe steps. But the cookbook is in the oven. So the user needs to take it out first.

Wait, the user is in the kitchen, and the oven is open. The cookbook is inside. So the user needs to take the cookbook out of the oven. But the user's last action was putting the cookbook in the oven. So the next step should be to take it out. But the user might not have realized that. So the correct action is "take cookbook from oven".

But the user's previous action was putting the cookbook in the oven. So maybe the user needs to take it out first to read the recipe. Then, follow the steps. So the next action should be "take cookbook from oven".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a recipe from the cookbook. The recipe says to dice the yellow potato. But when they tried to use the knife on the potato, it didn't work. The error message says "That's not a verb I recognise." So maybe the correct action is to cut the potato with the knife.

Wait, the user has the knife and the yellow potato. The previous attempt was "use knife on yellow potato", which didn't work. But the recipe says "dice the yellow potato", which might require the knife. Maybe the correct command is "cut yellow potato with knife" or "dice yellow potato". But the system didn't accept "dice" before. Alternatively, maybe "cut" is the correct verb here. Let me check the previous interactions.

Earlier, when the user tried "dice yellow potato", the system responded that cutting requires a knife. Then the user tried "use knife on yellow potato", which was rejected. So perhaps the correct action is to use the knife on the potato to dice it. But the system might expect a specific command. Maybe "cut yellow potato with knife" or "cut the yellow potato with the knife". But the user can only input the command, not the full sentence. The previous correct action was "use knife on yellow potato", but that didn't work. Wait, maybe the correct verb is "cut" instead of "dice". The recipe says "dice the yellow potato", but maybe the game expects "cut" as the verb. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "slice" or "chop". But the recipe says "dice", so perhaps the correct action is "dice yellow potato", but the system didn't accept it. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to first use the knife on the potato to cut it. The error message says that cutting requires a knife, so maybe the correct action is "cut yellow potato with knife". But the system might not recognize that. Alternatively, the user might need to "cut the yellow potato" without specifying the knife, but the system requires using the knife. Since the user has the knife, maybe the correct command is "cut yellow potato with knife". But the system might not accept that. Alternatively, maybe the correct action is "cut yellow potato", and the system just didn't recognize it before. Maybe the user should try "cut yellow potato" again. But in the previous attempt, the system said that cutting requires a knife. So maybe the user needs to use the knife first. Wait, the user has the knife and the potato. So the correct action is to use the knife on the potato to cut it. But the system rejected "use knife on yellow potato". Maybe the correct command is "cut yellow potato with knife". But the system might not recognize that. Alternatively, maybe the correct verb is "dice", but the system didn't accept it. The user is stuck here. The next step is to try "cut yellow potato with knife" or "cut the yellow potato with the knife". But the system might only accept "cut yellow potato". Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "slice" the potato. But the recipe says "dice". This is confusing. The user needs to follow the recipe steps, so the correct action is to dice the potato. But the system is not recognizing the command. Maybe the correct action is "cut yellow potato".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the recipe to dice the yellow potato. They've tried several commands, but the system isn't recognizing them. The last attempt was "cut yellow potato with knife", but the system only understood up to "cut the yellow potato". Maybe the correct command is simply "cut yellow potato" without specifying the knife, but the system says cutting requires a knife. Wait, the user has the knife in their inventory. Maybe the correct action is to use the knife on the potato. But earlier, "use knife on yellow potato" was rejected. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the system expects the command "dice yellow potato" but the user tried "cut". The recipe says "dice", so perhaps that's the correct verb. But the system said "cutting requires a knife" when the user tried "dice". Wait, no, the user tried "dice yellow potato" and the system responded that cutting requires a knife. So maybe the correct action is to first use the knife on the potato to cut it. But the system isn't accepting "use knife on yellow potato". Maybe the correct command is "cut yellow potato with knife". But the system says it only understood up to "cut the yellow potato". Maybe the user needs to just say "cut yellow potato" and the system will accept it, even though the knife is needed. Alternatively, maybe the knife is already in use. This is confusing. The user needs to proceed with the correct command, so perhaps "cut yellow potato" is the right choice despite the previous error.

Okay, the user is trying to cut the yellow potato, but the system isn't recognizing the commands. They've tried "cut yellow potato with knife" multiple times, but the system only understands up to "cut the yellow potato". The recipe says to dice it, but the system might not accept "dice". The user has the knife, so maybe the correct action is to use the knife on the potato. But previous attempts to use the knife were rejected. Maybe the system expects a different verb, like "slice" or "chop". Alternatively, the user might need to just say "cut yellow potato" without specifying the knife. Since the system says cutting requires a knife, but the user has it, maybe the correct command is "cut yellow potato with knife" again. But the system is not accepting it. The user is stuck, so they need to try a different approach. Maybe the next step is to "chop yellow potato" or "slice yellow potato" as alternatives. But the recipe says "dice", so perhaps that's the correct verb. The user needs to proceed with the command that the system might accept, even if it's not perfect.

Okay, the user is stuck on cutting the yellow potato. They've tried multiple commands, but the system isn't recognizing them. The recipe says to dice it, but the system requires a specific verb. The user has the knife, so maybe the correct action is to use the knife on the potato. But previous attempts to use the knife were rejected. The system might expect "cut" as the verb, but the user needs to specify "slice", "dice", or "chop". Since the recipe says "dice", maybe that's the right command. The user should try "dice yellow potato" again, even though the system says cutting requires a knife. Alternatively, the user might need to use the knife first. But the system isn't accepting "use knife on yellow potato". The user is close, but needs to find the right command. The next step is to try "dice yellow potato" again.

Okay, the user is trying to use the knife on the yellow potato, but the system keeps rejecting the command. They've tried "use knife on yellow potato" multiple times, but it's not working. The available commands include "cut", "dice", "slice", "chop", but the user hasn't tried those. The recipe says to dice the potato, so maybe the correct verb is "dice". The user needs to try "dice yellow potato" again. The system might not recognize "dice" but accepts "cut". The user is close, so they should try "dice yellow potato" one more time.
