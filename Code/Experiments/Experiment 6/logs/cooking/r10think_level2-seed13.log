You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You've entered a kitchen.

You make out an opened conventional looking fridge in the corner. The fridge contains a yellow onion, a yellow apple, a red onion, a raw pork chop, a white onion and an orange bell pepper. You make out an oven. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. Look over there! a table. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a raw yellow potato, a green hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Silly stove, silly, empty, good for nothing stove.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is in a kitchen game where they need to cook a meal using the ingredients from the cookbook. So far, they've taken the cookbook, tried to open it, but it wasn't possible. Then they looked at the cookbook and found a recipe. The recipe says to slice the yellow onion and roast it, along with dicing and roasting the yellow potato.

The user tried to slice the yellow onion but got a message saying cutting requires a knife. They took the knife from the counter, but when they tried to slice the onion again, they got the same message. Then they tried using the knife on the onion, but the system said that's not a recognized verb.

Hmm, maybe the correct action is to use the knife to slice the onion. The previous attempt to "use knife on yellow onion" was rejected, but maybe the correct command is "slice yellow onion with knife" or something similar. Alternatively, maybe the knife is already in hand, so the command is just "slice yellow onion".

Wait, in the game's context, after taking the knife, the user needs to use it to slice the onion. The error message says "Cutting something requires a knife," which implies that the knife is needed. But the user already has the knife. So perhaps the correct action is "slice yellow onion" again, but the system is expecting a different command. Alternatively, maybe "cut yellow onion with knife".

But the user tried "use knife on yellow onion" and got an error. Maybe the correct verb is "slice" instead of "use". Let me check the previous steps. The user had the knife, so maybe the correct command is "slice yellow onion" again. The system might have rejected "use knife on yellow onion" because the correct verb is "slice" with the knife being the tool. So the next action should be "slice yellow onion".

Okay, the user is trying to follow a recipe to cook a meal in a text-based game. They've already sliced the yellow onion and have the knife. The next step in the recipe is to roast the yellow onion. The user has tried several variations of "roast yellow onion" with different prepositions and verbs but keeps getting errors.

The problem might be that the game expects a specific command structure. Since the user has the knife and the onion, maybe the correct action is to use the oven. The recipe says "roast the yellow onion," so perhaps the correct command is "roast yellow onion in oven" or "put yellow onion in oven." But the user has tried "roast yellow onion with oven" and "roast yellow onion in oven," both of which didn't work.

Alternatively, maybe the game uses "put" instead of "roast." The user might need to place the onion in the oven. The previous step was slicing the onion, so now they need to put it in the oven to roast it. The correct command could be "put yellow onion in oven." Let me check the possible commands again. The user has the knife and the onion, so the next logical step is to put the onion in the oven to roast it. The game might require the exact phrase "put yellow onion in oven" or "roast yellow onion in oven." Since "roast" isn't working, maybe "put" is the right verb here. The user should try "put yellow onion in oven."

Okay, the user is trying to roast the yellow onion in the oven. They've already put it in the oven, but when they try to roast it, the game says "That's not a verb I recognise." So, maybe the correct command isn't "roast" but something else. Let me think about the possible commands.

In previous steps, the user tried "roast yellow onion in oven" and it didn't work. Maybe the game expects a different verb, like "heat" or "cook." Alternatively, maybe they need to use the oven's function. Since the oven is already open and the onion is inside, perhaps the next step is to close the oven and wait for it to roast. But the recipe says to roast it, so maybe the correct action is to "close the oven" to start the roasting process. Alternatively, the game might require the user to "put the onion in the oven" and then "close the oven," but the user already put it in. Wait, the user opened the oven, put the onion in, and now needs to close it. But the recipe says to roast, so maybe closing the oven is part of the process. Let me check the previous steps again.

The user has the onion in the oven. The next step in the recipe is to roast it. Since "roast" isn't working, maybe the correct action is to "close the oven" to start the roasting. Alternatively, the game might use "heat" as the verb. But the user has already put the onion in. Maybe the correct command is "close oven" to let it roast. Let me try that.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

<think>
Okay, the user is stuck trying to roast the yellow onion in the oven. They've tried "roast", "heat", and "thouse" (probably a typo for "house" or "roast"), but the game isn't recognizing those as valid verbs. Let me think about the possible correct commands.

In the game's context, after putting the onion in the oven and closing it, the next step might be to "wait" for it to roast, but that's not a verb the game expects. Alternatively, maybe the correct action is to "close" the oven again, but the user already did that. Wait, the recipe says "roast the yellow onion", so maybe the game expects the user to use the oven's function. Since the oven is closed, perhaps the correct command is to "heat" the onion in the oven, but "heat" isn't working. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "cook" the onion, but that's not a recognized verb either.

Wait, maybe the game uses "roast" as a verb but requires the user to specify the oven. So "roast yellow onion with oven" or "roast yellow onion in oven". But the user tried "roast yellow onion in oven" and it didn't work. Maybe the correct command is "roast yellow onion". The game might be expecting just "roast yellow onion" without specifying the oven since it's already in the oven. Let me check the previous steps again. The user put the onion in the oven and closed it. So the next step is to roast it, which might just be "roast yellow onion". The game might have a typo or the user is missing a step. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "turn on" the oven, but that's not in the recipe. The recipe says to roast, so the correct command is likely "roast yellow onion".

Okay, the user is having trouble with the game's response when trying to roast the yellow onion. They've tried multiple commands like "roast yellow onion in oven" and "roast yellow onion with oven", but the game keeps saying it's not a recognized verb. Let me think about possible solutions.

First, maybe the correct command is simpler. The recipe says "roast the yellow onion", so perhaps the game expects just "roast yellow onion" without specifying the oven. But the user has the onion in the oven, so maybe the oven is already in use. Alternatively, maybe the game uses a different verb like "heat" or "cook".

Another angle: the user previously tried "put yellow onion in oven" and it worked. Maybe the next step is to "close the oven" to start the roasting process. But the user already closed the oven. Wait, the user opened the oven, put the onion in, then closed it. Maybe the game expects them to "heat" the oven or "start" the roasting. But the recipe says "roast", so perhaps the correct verb is "roast".

Alternatively, maybe the game requires the user to use the oven's function. Since the oven is closed, maybe the correct command is "roast yellow onion in oven" but the game doesn't recognize it. Maybe the user needs to "heat" the onion in the oven. But "heat" isn't working either.

Wait, the user has the knife and the onion. Maybe the next step is to "dice the yellow potato" as per the recipe. The user hasn't done that yet. The recipe says to dice the yellow potato and roast it. So maybe the user should first dice the potato, then roast it. But the user is focused on the onion. However, the recipe's directions are to slice the onion, roast the onion, dice the potato, roast the potato. So maybe the user needs to do both. But the user is stuck on the onion. Maybe the game is expecting the user to complete both steps. But the user is only on the onion part.

Alternatively, maybe the game is expecting the user to "roast" the onion without specifying the oven, but the game doesn't recognize it. Maybe the correct command is "roast yellow onion" and the game is just having a typo. Let me try that again.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

<think>
Okay, the user is stuck again. They've tried multiple commands like "roast yellow onion in oven" and "roast yellow onion with oven", but the game keeps saying it's not a recognized verb. Let me think about possible correct commands.

Maybe the game expects a different verb. The recipe says "roast the yellow onion", so perhaps the correct command is just "roast yellow onion" without specifying the oven. But the user has the onion in the oven, so maybe the oven is already in use. Alternatively, maybe the game uses "heat" or "cook" as the verb. Let me try "heat yellow onion in oven".

Wait, the user previously tried "roast" and it didn't work. Maybe the correct verb is "roast" but the game is case-sensitive. Let me check the previous steps. The user wrote "roast yellow onion in oven" and it didn't work. Maybe the correct command is "roast yellow onion" without the "in oven" part. Let me try that.

Okay, the user is really stuck here. They've tried every variation of "roast yellow onion in oven" and it's not working. Let me think about the possible correct command. Maybe the game expects a different verb like "heat" or "cook". Alternatively, maybe the correct action is to "close" the oven again, but the user already did that. Wait, the recipe says "roast the yellow onion", so maybe the correct command is just "roast yellow onion" without specifying the oven.
