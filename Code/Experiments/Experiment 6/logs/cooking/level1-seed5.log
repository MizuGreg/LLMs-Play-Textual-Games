You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

You're now in the kitchen.

You make out a fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop, a white onion, a red bell pepper and a carrot. You see an oven. You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can make out a counter. You see a banana on the counter. You make out a stove. But the thing is empty.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a kitchen game where they need to cook a meal. The cookbook has a recipe that's confusing because the ingredients listed are just banana. The directions say to dice the banana, roast it, and prepare the meal. But the fridge has raw pork chop, onion, bell pepper, and carrot. The table has a cookbook, knife, and there's a banana on the counter. The stove is empty.

The user has already tried opening the cookbook, but it wasn't possible at first. Then they looked around and at the cookbook, which led them to the recipe. Now they're asking if they're on the right track and what the next step should be.

Hmm, the recipe seems incomplete or maybe a trick. The ingredients listed are only banana, but the fridge has other items. Maybe the recipe is a red herring, or maybe the user is supposed to use the banana as the main ingredient. But the user has a knife and the stove. The directions say to dice the banana and roast it. So maybe the next step is to take the banana from the counter, dice it, then roast it in the oven or on the stove. But the stove is empty. Wait, the oven is in the kitchen. So maybe the user needs to put the diced banana in the oven. But the recipe says "roast the banana," which could be done on the stove. But the stove is empty. Maybe the user needs to use the stove. Alternatively, maybe the recipe is incorrect, but the user has to follow it anyway.

The user's next action should be to take the banana, dice it, then roast it. But the user has to interact with the objects. So the next step would be to take the banana from the counter. Then dice it. Then roast it. But the user has to use the knife. So the steps are: take banana, dice with knife, then roast in oven or stove. But the stove is empty. Maybe the user needs to put the diced banana into the oven. But the oven's state isn't specified. The user has to follow the recipe's directions. So the next action would be to take the banana from the counter. Let me check the available objects again. The counter has a banana. So the user should take the banana. Then dice it. Then roast it. But the user has to use the knife. So the next action is to take the banana. Then dice it. Then roast. But the user's current location is the kitchen. So the next command should be to take the banana from the counter. Then proceed with dicing and roasting. But the user's last action was looking at the cookbook, so the next step is to take the banana. So the answer is "take banana".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the recipe from the cookbook. The recipe says to dice the banana and then roast it. They took the banana from the counter, but now they need to dice it. The problem is that the game doesn't recognize "use knife" as a valid command. Maybe the correct command is to use the knife on the banana. But the user tried "use knife on banana" and got an error. Wait, maybe the game expects a different phrasing. Maybe "cut banana with knife" or "dice banana with knife"? Alternatively, maybe the knife is already in hand, so the command is just "dice banana". But the user tried "dice banana" and got an error. Hmm. The game might require a specific verb. The previous attempt was "use knife on banana", which didn't work. Maybe the correct command is "cut banana with knife" or "slice banana with knife". Alternatively, maybe the game expects "dice banana" without specifying the tool, assuming the knife is available. But the user has a knife on the table. Wait, the table has a knife. So maybe the user needs to pick up the knife first. Wait, the user is already in the kitchen, and the knife is on the table. So maybe the correct sequence is: take knife, then dice banana. But the user hasn't picked up the knife yet. So the next step should be to take the knife, then use it to dice the banana. But the user's last action was "use knife on banana", which didn't work. Maybe the correct command is "cut banana with knife". Alternatively, maybe the game expects "dice banana" without the knife, but that's not possible. The user has to use the knife. So the next action should be to take the knife, then dice the banana. But the user hasn't taken the knife yet. So the correct next step is to take the knife first. But the user's previous action was trying to use the knife on the banana.

The user took the banana from the counter but now needs to dice it. The game keeps asking to use the knife on the banana, but the user hasn't picked up the knife yet. The previous attempt to use the knife directly failed because the knife wasn't taken. So the correct step is to take the knife first. The user is at the kitchen, and the knife is on the table.
