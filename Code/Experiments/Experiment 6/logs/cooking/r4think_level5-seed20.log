You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. An usual one.

You can make out a fridge! The fridge contains a raw pork chop, a raw white tuna, a white onion and a raw red tuna. You make out a closed oven. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a knife. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a cookbook. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.

There is an open frosted-glass door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game where they need to cook a meal. The goal is to find the recipe in the kitchen, cook the meal, and then enjoy it. So far, the player has moved from the kitchen through the living room, corridor, and back to the living room. The kitchen was the starting point where they found the ingredients and the cookbook. But in the current location, the living room, there's no cookbook mentioned. The previous steps involved moving east, south, north, which brought them back to the living room.

The user is now asking if they're making the right actions and if they're close to the goal. The key here is to check if they've completed the cooking part. In the kitchen, they had the ingredients: raw pork chop, white tuna, red tuna, onion, and a knife. The cookbook was on the counter. The player needs to use those items to cook a meal. But in the current location, the living room, there's no indication of the cookbook or the ingredients. So maybe the player hasn't used the kitchen items yet.

The next step should be to go back to the kitchen. The living room has an exit to the west, which would lead back to the kitchen. The player needs to retrieve the cookbook, follow the recipe, and cook the meal. Since the previous movements looped back to the living room, the correct next action is to go west to return to the kitchen and continue cooking. The user might have been moving around without revisiting the kitchen, which is essential for the goal. So the next command should be "go west" to get back to the kitchen and proceed with cooking.

<think>
Okay, let's break this down. The user is in a text-based game where the goal is to cook a meal using ingredients found in the kitchen. The user has been moving between rooms, mostly looping between the kitchen, living room, and corridor. The key items needed are the cookbook, the ingredients from the fridge, and the knife on the table.

So far, the user has returned to the kitchen, which is where everything starts. The fridge has the raw ingredients, the cookbook is on the counter, and there's a knife. The oven is closed, so maybe the next step is to use the cookbook to find a recipe and then cook the meal. The user hasn't actually used any of the ingredients yet, so the next logical step would be to check the cookbook for a recipe. But the game's structure might require interacting with the items. Since the user is in the kitchen again, the next action should be to open the cookbook to get the recipe. Then, using the ingredients and knife to prepare the meal. The user might need to follow the recipe steps, maybe cook the ingredients in the oven. But the current prompt says to only output the command, so the next step is to check the cookbook.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal in this text game. They started in the kitchen, found the ingredients and the cookbook, but now they're back in the living room. The problem is that they can't find the cookbook again. Wait, earlier when they were in the kitchen, the cookbook was on the counter. Maybe they didn't pick it up yet. But now they're in the living room, so maybe they left it in the kitchen. The user needs to go back to the kitchen to get the cookbook. The previous attempts to "open cookbook" and "look at cookbook" didn't work because they weren't in the kitchen. So the correct next step is to go back to the kitchen, retrieve the cookbook, and then follow the recipe. The user has been moving between rooms, but hasn't revisited the kitchen since the start. So the next action should be to go west to return to the kitchen.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the kitchen and just looked at the cookbook. The recipe says to gather pork chop and white tuna, then slice and roast them. The user has the ingredients in the fridge. Next step is to take the pork chop and white tuna. But the fridge is closed. So first, they need to open the fridge. Then take the ingredients. Then slice them using the knife on the table. Then roast in the oven. But the oven is closed. So maybe open the oven first. But the recipe says to slice the pork chop and roast it. So maybe the user needs to take the pork chop from the fridge, slice it, then roast it. But the oven needs to be opened. Wait, the user is supposed to follow the directions. The directions are: slice the pork chop, roast the pork chop, slice the white tuna, roast the white tuna, prepare meal. So the user needs to perform each step. But in the game, they have to interact with the items. So first, take the pork chop from the fridge. Then slice it. Then roast it. Then do the same for the white tuna. Then prepare the meal. But the user is currently in the kitchen, looking at the cookbook. The next action should be to take the pork chop from the fridge. But the fridge is closed. So first, open the fridge. Then take the pork chop. Then slice it. Then roast it. But the oven is closed. So maybe open the oven first. But the recipe says to roast the pork chop, so maybe the user needs to put it in the oven. But the oven is closed. So the steps are: open the fridge, take pork chop, slice it, open oven, roast it. Then do the same for the white tuna. Then prepare the meal. But the user is at the cookbook. So the next action should be to open the fridge to get the ingredients. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the correct next step is to open the fridge.

GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. An usual one.

You can make out a fridge! The fridge contains a raw white tuna, a white onion and a raw red tuna. You make out a closed oven. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a table. The table is massive. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a cookbook. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.

There is an open frosted-glass door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal in this game. They've already taken the pork chop from the fridge, sliced it, and now they're in the kitchen again. The recipe says to roast the pork chop. But the oven is closed. So the next step should be to open the oven. The user needs to open the oven to roast the pork chop. The available commands include 'open', so the correct action is to open the oven.

Wait, but in the current room description, the oven is closed. So the user needs to open it. The command would be 'open oven'. Let me check the previous steps. The user had the pork chop and knife. They sliced the pork chop, so now they need to put it in the oven. But first, the oven must be open. So the next action is to open the oven.

Okay, the user has put the pork chop into the oven. The next step according to the recipe is to roast the pork chop. But how do you roast it in the game? Maybe the oven needs to be turned on or set to a temperature. However, the available commands don't include adjusting the oven. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to wait for it to roast. But the recipe says "roast the pork chop," so perhaps the oven is already set to roast mode. Since the user opened the oven and put the pork chop in, the next step is to close the oven and let it roast. The command would be "close oven". Then, after roasting, take it out and proceed with the rest of the recipe. But the user has to follow each step. So after putting the pork chop in, close the oven. Then, maybe check the oven later. But the current step is to roast, so closing the oven might be the next action.

Okay, the user is trying to roast the pork chop. The previous attempts to use "roast" as a command didn't work. The available commands include "open", "close", "put", "take", etc. Maybe the correct action is to leave the pork chop in the oven and wait for it to roast. But the game might require a specific command. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the oven's function. Since the oven was closed, perhaps the next step is to open it again, but it's already open. Wait, the user closed the oven after putting the pork chop in. Maybe the oven needs to be opened again to roast it. But that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the "roast" command with the oven. But the available commands don't include that. The correct action might be to leave the pork chop in the oven and proceed to the next step in the recipe, which is to slice the white tuna. So the user should take the white tuna from the fridge, slice it, and roast it. But the user is currently in the kitchen. The next step is to take the white tuna from the fridge. The fridge is open, so the command would be "take white tuna from fridge".

Okay, the user is trying to eat the pork chop and white tuna but keeps getting told they can't see any such thing. Let me think about the game's state. The user has followed the recipe steps: taken the ingredients, sliced them, put them in the oven, closed it, and now they're trying to eat them. But the game might require the user to actually take the cooked items out of the oven first. The oven is closed, so they need to open it again to retrieve the pork chop and white tuna. Then, once they're out of the oven, they can eat them. The previous steps had the user close the oven after putting the white tuna in, so opening it again would allow access to the cooked items. The correct next action should be to open the oven to get the meal.
