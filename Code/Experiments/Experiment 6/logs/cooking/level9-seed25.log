You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one. There is an exit to the west.

Ah, the bedroom. This is some kind of bedroom, really great normal vibes in this place, a wonderful normal atmosphere. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You can make out a bed. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one. There is an exit to the west.

-= Bedroom =-
Ah, the bedroom. This is some kind of bedroom, really great normal vibes in this place, a wonderful normal atmosphere. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You can make out a bed. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one. There is an exit to the west.

-= Livingroom =-
You arrive in a livingroom. A standard kind of place.

You can see a sofa. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The sofa is comfy. But there isn't a thing on it.

There is an exit to the east. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.
