You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You're now in the kitchen. You begin looking for stuff.

You can make out a fridge. The fridge contains a red onion, a red bell pepper, a yellow onion, a raw white tuna and a white onion. You can see an oven. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.
