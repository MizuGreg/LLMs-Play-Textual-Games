You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

You arrive in a pantry. An ordinary one.

You can see a shelf. The shelf is wooden. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Hm. Oh well

There is an open plain door leading north.

-= Kitchen =-
You've entered a kitchen.

Hey, want to see a fridge? Look over there, a fridge. The fridge contains a yellow onion, a yellow bell pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, a red onion, a carrot and a raw white tuna. A closed oven is close by. You can see a table. The table is massive. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh, great. Here's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a raw yellow potato, a yellow apple, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. Oh, great. Here's a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.

There is an open plain door leading south. There is an exit to the west.

<think>
Okay, let me think through this. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the cookbook in the kitchen. So far, they've gone from the pantry to the kitchen, taken the cookbook from the counter, opened the oven, put the cookbook inside, and then closed the oven again.

The original goal was to cook a delicious meal by checking the cookbook and then enjoying the meal. The user is asking if they're on the right track and if they're close to achieving the goal. 

Looking at the steps taken: the cookbook was placed in the oven. But wait, the cookbook is probably just a reference, not an ingredient. The user needs to use the ingredients from the fridge and cook something. But the user hasn't actually started cooking yet. They just put the cookbook in the oven, which might not be necessary. Maybe the next step is to use the ingredients from the fridge to prepare a dish. 

The user might have misunderstood the recipe. The cookbook is there, but they need to follow the steps in it. However, the current actions don't involve using the ingredients. The oven is closed, but maybe they need to heat something up. Alternatively, maybe the cookbook is part of the recipe, and the user needs to use the ingredients to make a meal. 

But the user hasn't actually started cooking yet. The next logical step would be to take an ingredient from the fridge, maybe the yellow onion, yellow bell pepper, etc., and start preparing a dish. Alternatively, maybe the oven needs to be used to bake something. But since the oven is closed, they might need to open it again. However, the user already closed it after putting the cookbook in. 

Wait, the user's last action was closing the oven after putting the cookbook in. That might not be the right approach. Maybe the cookbook is supposed to be used to find the recipe, not put in the oven. So perhaps the user needs to read the cookbook, then use the ingredients to cook. But the user hasn't used any ingredients yet. 

So the next action should be to take an ingredient from the fridge, like the yellow onion, and start preparing a dish. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to open the oven again to use it for cooking. But the user might need to first check the cookbook's recipe. However, the user already took the cookbook. 

Wait, the user is in the kitchen, and the cookbook is on the counter. They put it in the oven, which seems odd. Maybe that's a mistake. The correct approach is to use the ingredients from the fridge and the stove to cook. So the next step should be to take an ingredient, like the yellow onion, and start cooking. 

But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action should be to take an ingredient from the fridge, like the yellow onion, and then use the stove to cook it. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to open the oven again to use it. But the user might need to first read the recipe in the cookbook. 

But since the user is following the steps, maybe the next step is to take an ingredient from the fridge. Let's say the user takes the yellow onion and starts cooking. So the next action would be to take the yellow onion from the fridge.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal in this text-based game. They've gone through the pantry, entered the kitchen, taken the cookbook, put it in the oven, and then closed the oven. Then they tried to take a yellow onion from the fridge, which worked. Now they're trying to "use onion on stove," but the system says that's not a recognized verb.

Hmm, so maybe the correct command isn't "use onion on stove." In many text games, you might need to use a different phrasing. Like "cook the onion on the stove" or "put the onion on the stove." Alternatively, maybe the action is "stir fry" or "boil," but that depends on the game's specific commands.

Wait, the user previously put the cookbook in the oven. Maybe the oven is supposed to be used for baking, but the user might need to open it again. But the user already closed it. Alternatively, maybe the correct action is to "heat the stove" or "light the stove." But the user has the onion, so perhaps they need to cook it.

Another thought: the game might expect the user to use the stove's functions. Since the stove is conventional, maybe the user needs to "turn on the stove" or "light the stove." But the user has the onion, so maybe the next step is to place it on the stove. However, the system didn't accept "use onion on stove."

Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "put onion on stove." Let me check the previous interactions. The user tried "use onion on stove," which was rejected. Maybe the game expects "put onion on stove" or "place onion on stove." Or perhaps "cook onion with stove."

But the user needs to follow the game's accepted commands. Since "use onion on stove" didn't work, maybe the correct action is "put onion on stove." Let me try that.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal in this game. They've taken the yellow onion from the fridge and put it on the stove. But when they tried to "cook onion," the system asked which onion they meant, and then said they need to take the yellow onion first.

Wait, maybe the user didn't actually take the onion from the stove yet. The previous action was "put yellow onion on stove," which worked, but maybe the next step is to take it off the stove to cook it? Or maybe the command is different. The system might expect "cook the yellow onion" instead of "cook onion."

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the stove's function. Since the stove is conventional, perhaps the correct action is "heat the stove" or "light the stove" before cooking. But the user already put the onion on the stove. Hmm.

The system said "You need to take the yellow onion first," which suggests that the onion is still on the stove, and the user needs to take it off to cook it. So maybe the next step is to take the onion from the stove, then cook it. But the user might need to use the correct command for that. The previous command was "cook onion," which was rejected, so maybe "cook yellow onion" is the correct command. But the system said they need to take it first.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal in this text game. They've gone through several steps: taking the cookbook, putting it in the oven, taking an onion from the fridge, putting it on the stove, taking it off, and now trying to cut the onion with a knife.

The system has been responding to their commands, but there's some confusion. The user tried "use knife on yellow onion" and "cut yellow onion with knife," but the system didn't recognize those. The last response was "I only understood you as far as wanting to cut the yellow onion." So the user needs to find the correct command to cut the onion.

In many text games, the correct syntax might be "cut the yellow onion" or "cut onion with knife." Since the user has the knife on the counter, maybe the correct command is "cut onion with knife." But the system didn't accept that. Alternatively, maybe "cut yellow onion" without specifying the knife. Let me try "cut yellow onion" again. If that doesn't work, maybe "cut onion with knife" is the right command. The user needs to use the correct phrasing that the game expects. Since the previous attempt with "cut yellow onion with knife" didn't work, perhaps just "cut yellow onion" is the right command. Let's try that.

Okay, the user is trying to cut the yellow onion in the kitchen game. They've tried "cut yellow onion" but the system says they need to specify how to cut it—slice, dice, or chop. The user then tried "thouse yellow onion," which is probably a typo for "chop" or "dice." The system still doesn't recognize it.

So, the correct commands should be "slice yellow onion," "dice yellow onion," or "chop yellow onion." Since the user previously tried "cut" and it didn't work, they need to use one of the specified methods. The next step is to choose one of those verbs. Let's go with "dice" since it's a common way to cut onions. The command should be "dice yellow onion."

Okay, the user is stuck in the kitchen game. They've tried several commands to cut the onion but keep getting errors. Let me recap the steps so far. They took the cookbook, put it in the oven, took an onion from the fridge, put it on the stove, took it off, and now trying to cut it. The system is having trouble with commands like "cut" and "dice."

Maybe the correct command is simply "cut onion" without specifying the method. The system might expect "cut onion" as the verb. Alternatively, "slice onion" or "chop onion." Since the user has the knife, perhaps the command is "cut onion with knife," but the system didn't recognize that. Maybe the knife is already in hand, so just "cut onion." Let's try "cut onion" as the next command.

Okay, the user is trying to cut the onion with the knife in the kitchen game. They've taken the knife from the counter but keep getting errors. The system says "That's not a verb I recognise" when they try "cut onion with knife." Maybe the correct command is just "cut onion" without specifying the knife, since the knife is already in hand. Alternatively, the game might expect a different phrasing like "slice onion" or "dice onion." Let's try "cut onion" again.

Okay, the user is trying to dice the onion but the system isn't recognizing the command. They've tried "dice onion" and got a response asking for clarification. Maybe the correct command is "cut onion" or "slice onion" instead. Since the user has the knife, perhaps "cut onion with knife" is the right phrase, but the system didn't accept it. Alternatively, the game might expect a different verb. Let's try "cut onion" again.

Okay, the user is trying to cook the sliced onion. They used "use oil on onion," but the system says "You can't see any such thing." So maybe the oil isn't available. Let me check the inventory. The user has the knife, onion, and maybe other ingredients. Wait, in the kitchen, the fridge has ingredients like onion, bell pepper, cheese, etc. But the user already took the onion. Maybe they need to use the stove's function. The stove is conventional, so perhaps the correct command is "put onion on stove" or "heat stove." But the user already put the onion on the stove earlier. Maybe they need to "cook onion" without specifying. Alternatively, "fry onion" or "saute onion." Let's try "fry onion."
