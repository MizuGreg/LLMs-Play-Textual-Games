You find yourself in a kitchen. A typical kind of place.

You see a fridge. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a closed oven, which looks conventional, close by. You see a table. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You scan the room for a counter, and you find a counter. You see a red hot pepper, a raw red potato, a tomato, a raw yellow potato, a yellow apple, a red onion, a green hot pepper, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well

There is a closed frosted-glass door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they need to cook a meal. They started in the living room, moved through the corridor, and ended up in the kitchen. The kitchen has various ingredients and a cookbook. The user tried to open the cookbook but was told it wasn't something that could be opened. Then they took the cookbook instead.

Now, the user is asking if they've been making the right moves and if they're close to the goal. The next step would be to use the cookbook to find a recipe. Since the cookbook is in hand, the next logical action is to check the recipes inside. But since the game's previous response said the cookbook can't be opened, maybe the user needs to look at it instead. However, in text adventures, often you can look at items to see their contents. So maybe the correct action here is to look at the cookbook to find the recipe. But the user already took it, so perhaps they need to read it. But the game's previous response said "It isn't something you can open," so maybe the user needs to look at it. Alternatively, maybe the cookbook is a book that can be read, so the next step is to read it. But the user's last action was taking the cookbook, so the next step would be to look at it to find the recipe. However, the game's previous response might have restrictions. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the cookbook to find a recipe and then cook the ingredients. So the next action would be to look at the cookbook to find the recipe. But the user has to follow the game's possible commands. Since the user is in the kitchen, and the cookbook is taken, the next step is to check the recipes in the cookbook. So the correct command would be "look at cookbook" or "read cookbook". But in some games, you can only interact with items in certain ways. Since the user previously tried to open it and it wasn't possible, maybe the correct action is to look at it. However, the user's last action was taking the cookbook, so the next step is to use it. The game's previous response said that the user can't open it, but they can take it. So the next step is to look at the cookbook to find the recipe. Therefore, the next command should be "look at cookbook".

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, the user is trying to follow a recipe from the cookbook. The recipe says to "slice the orange bell pepper," but when they try to do that, the game responds that they can't see any such thing. Hmm, maybe the orange bell pepper isn't in the kitchen yet. Let me check the items available.

Looking back at the kitchen description, the user found a red hot pepper, a raw red potato, a tomato, a raw yellow potato, a yellow apple, a red onion, a green hot pepper, a raw purple potato, the cookbook, and a knife. Wait, the recipe calls for an orange bell pepper, but the available vegetables are red, yellow, and green peppers, potatoes, onions, and a tomato. There's no mention of an orange bell pepper. Maybe that's a mistake in the recipe, or maybe the user needs to find another way to get the required ingredient.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to look for the orange bell pepper in the kitchen. But according to the previous description, the counter has the red hot pepper, raw red potato, tomato, etc. No orange bell pepper listed. So perhaps the recipe has an error, or maybe the user needs to use a different approach. Since the game doesn't allow seeing the pepper, maybe the user needs to take the available ingredients and proceed with what's there. But the recipe specifically mentions an orange bell pepper. Maybe the user should check if there's another way to obtain it, like looking in the fridge or oven. But the fridge is closed, and the oven is closed. Alternatively, maybe the user can use the knife to cut the available peppers, even if they're not the exact type. But the game is strict about the ingredients. 

Since the user can't find the orange bell pepper, maybe they need to try a different recipe or find another way. But the user is stuck on this recipe. The next step might be to check if there's another recipe in the cookbook, but the user only saw Recipe #1. Alternatively, maybe the user should try to take the available ingredients and proceed, even if they don't match the recipe. But the game requires following the recipe's steps. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to look for the orange bell pepper in another location, like the fridge. The user hasn't checked the fridge yet. The fridge is closed, so they might need to open it. Let me check the previous interactions. The user hasn't opened the fridge. So maybe the next step is to open the fridge to see if the orange bell pepper is inside. But the recipe says to gather the ingredients, so maybe the user needs to find the orange bell pepper in the fridge. 

Wait, the user is in the kitchen, and the fridge is a closed frosted-glass door leading west. The user hasn't tried opening the fridge yet. So the next action should be to open the fridge to check if the orange bell pepper is there. If not, maybe the recipe is incorrect, but the user has to proceed with what's available. Alternatively, maybe the user can use the knife to cut the available peppers, even if they're not the exact type. But the game's response says "You can't see any such thing," implying that the ingredient isn't present. 

So the correct next step is to open the fridge to check for the orange bell pepper. The user hasn't done that yet. So the next command should be to open the fridge.

Okay, the user is trying to follow the recipe step by step. They've successfully sliced the orange bell pepper using the knife. The next step in the recipe is to "roast the orange bell pepper." But the user hasn't mentioned roasting yet. Wait, the directions say "slice the orange bell pepper, roast the orange bell pepper," so after slicing, they need to roast it.

But the user's last action was slicing the orange bell pepper. Now, the next logical step would be to roast it. However, the user might not have the necessary tool or knowledge on how to roast. In the kitchen, there's a stove, so maybe they need to use the stove to roast the pepper. But the stove is conventional and might require putting the pepper on it. Alternatively, the oven is closed, but the recipe says to roast, which is usually done on the stove. 

The user has the knife, the orange bell pepper sliced, and the stove is available. So the next action should be to roast the sliced pepper on the stove. But the game might require specific commands. The user might need to put the pepper on the stove or use the stove to roast it. Since the stove is conventional, maybe the command is "roast the orange bell pepper" or "put the orange bell pepper on the stove." But the game's previous responses might have specific verbs. The user has already sliced the pepper, so the next step is to roast it. The correct command would be "roast the orange bell pepper." However, the user might need to use the stove. So the next action is to roast the pepper using the stove. The game might accept "roast the orange bell pepper" as the command.

Okay, the user is trying to roast the orange bell pepper but keeps getting "That's not a verb I recognise." error. Let me think about possible commands. The user has the pepper on the stove. Maybe the correct verb is "heat" or "cook". Alternatively, maybe "roast" is the correct verb but needs to be combined with the object and the stove. Previous attempts used "roast the orange bell pepper on stove", but the game didn't accept it. Maybe the correct command is "roast the orange bell pepper" without specifying the stove, assuming the stove is the current location. Alternatively, the user might need to use "cook" instead of "roast". Let me check the recipe again. The recipe says "roast the orange bell pepper", so the verb should be "roast". Maybe the game expects "roast" without the object, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, the user might need to use "put" to place it on the stove and then "roast". But the user already put it on the stove. Maybe the correct command is "roast" followed by the object. Wait, the user tried "roast the orange bell pepper" and it didn't work. Maybe the game expects "roast" as a verb without the object, but that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use "heat" the pepper. Or perhaps the correct command is "cook the orange bell pepper". Let me try "cook the orange bell pepper" as the next action.

Okay, the user is stuck again. They tried roasting the orange bell pepper on the stove but keep getting errors. Let me think. The previous steps: they took the orange bell pepper, put it on the stove, but maybe the correct action is to use the stove's heat. Maybe the verb is "heat" instead of "roast". Or perhaps the game expects "cook" as the verb. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the oven instead of the stove. But the recipe says to roast, which is usually done on the stove. Wait, the oven is closed. The user hasn't opened it. Maybe they need to open the oven first. But the recipe says to roast, not bake. Hmm. Alternatively, the user might need to use the word "roast" without specifying the stove, assuming it's the current location. But the game doesn't recognize it. Maybe the correct command is "roast" followed by the object. But the user tried that. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the verb "put" to place the pepper on the stove and then "roast". But the user already put it on the stove. Maybe the game expects "heat" the pepper. Let me try "heat the orange bell pepper" as the next action.
