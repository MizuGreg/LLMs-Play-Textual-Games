You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You've just shown up in a kitchen.

As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a fridge. The fridge contains a raw red tuna, an orange bell pepper, a red hot pepper, a red apple and a raw white tuna. You can see a closed oven in the room. You can make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You see a counter. You see a raw red potato, a red bell pepper, a raw yellow potato and a tomato on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. But the thing is empty.

-= Kitchen =-
You've just shown up in a kitchen.

As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a fridge. The fridge contains a raw red tuna, an orange bell pepper, a red hot pepper, a red apple and a raw white tuna. You can see a closed oven in the room. You can make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You see a counter. You see a raw red potato, a red bell pepper, a raw yellow potato and a tomato on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. But the thing is empty.
