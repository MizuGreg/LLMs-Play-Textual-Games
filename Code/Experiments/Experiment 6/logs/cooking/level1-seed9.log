You've just sauntered into a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

You see a fridge. What a letdown! The fridge is empty! Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's an oven. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. You can see a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a green apple, a green bell pepper and a yellow apple. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You see a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the recipe from the cookbook. The recipe says to chop the green apple, but the game is saying that chopping requires a knife. The user has already tried using the knife on the green apple, but the system didn't recognize it. Wait, maybe the correct action is to chop the apple with the knife. Let me check the previous interactions.

The user first tried "chop green apple", which was rejected. Then they tried "use knife on green apple", which also didn't work. The system says "That's not a verb I recognise." So maybe the correct command is to use the knife on the apple, but the game expects a different phrasing. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to chop the apple first, and then roast it. But the problem is that the game isn't accepting the "chop" command. Maybe the correct action is to "cut" the apple with the knife. Wait, the recipe says "chop the green apple", but the game requires a specific verb. Let me think about the possible commands. The user has a knife and an apple. The correct action might be "cut green apple with knife" or "cut the green apple with the knife". But the game might expect "chop" as the verb. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to first use the knife on the apple to chop it. But the previous attempt to "use knife on green apple" was rejected. Maybe the correct command is "chop green apple with knife"? Or perhaps the game expects "cut" instead of "chop". Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "chop" the apple, and the game is not recognizing "chop" as a valid verb. Wait, the user tried "chop green apple" and the game said "Cutting something requires a knife." So maybe the correct action is to use the knife on the apple first. But the user tried "use knife on green apple" and got an error. Maybe the correct command is "cut green apple with knife". Alternatively, maybe the game expects "chop" followed by the object and the tool. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. The user is stuck because the game isn't recognizing the commands. The next step would be to try a different phrasing, like "cut green apple with knife" or "chop green apple with knife". Alternatively, maybe the game is expecting "use knife to chop green apple". But the user has to follow the game's accepted verbs. Since the previous attempts didn't work, maybe the correct action is to "cut" the apple with the knife. Let me try that.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to roast the green apple. The previous attempts to use "roast" as a verb didn't work. The game might expect a different phrasing. Maybe "put in oven" or "place in oven"? Since the oven is in the kitchen, perhaps the correct action is to put the apple in the oven. The recipe says "roast the green apple," so maybe the user needs to first put it in the oven. Let me check the available actions. The user has the apple and the knife. They already chopped the apple. Now, they need to roast it. The correct command might be "put green apple in oven" or "roast green apple in oven." But the game didn't recognize "roast" before. Maybe the verb is "put" instead.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to roast the green apple. They've already chopped it and put it in the oven. The game is saying "That's not a verb I recognise" when they try to roast it. Maybe the correct action is to use the oven's function. Since the oven is open and the apple is inside, perhaps the next step is to "roast" the apple using the oven. But the game didn't accept "roast" before. Maybe the verb is "heat" or "cook". Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "turn on" the oven. Wait, the recipe says "roast the green apple", so maybe the correct command is "roast green apple with oven". But the game didn't recognize that. Alternatively, since the apple is in the oven, maybe the action is just "roast" without specifying the oven. But the user tried that and it didn't work. Maybe the game expects "cook" instead of "roast". Let me think. The user has the apple in the oven. The next step is to roast it. The correct command might be "roast green apple" again, but the game says it's not a verb. Maybe the user needs to "heat" the apple. Alternatively, maybe the oven has a specific action. Since the oven is open, perhaps the user needs to "roast" it. But the game is not accepting it. Maybe the answer is to just say "roast green apple" again, even though it's not recognized. Or maybe the game expects "cook" as the verb. Let me check previous interactions. The user tried "roast green apple with oven" and it didn't work.
