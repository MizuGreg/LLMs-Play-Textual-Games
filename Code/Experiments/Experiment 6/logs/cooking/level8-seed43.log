-= Kitchen =-
You've just shown up in a kitchen. The room is well lit.

You can make out a closed fridge. You make out an oven. Now why would someone leave that there? What's that over there? It looks like it's a table. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a tomato and a red hot pepper. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is a closed plain door leading east. You need an exit without a door? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.
