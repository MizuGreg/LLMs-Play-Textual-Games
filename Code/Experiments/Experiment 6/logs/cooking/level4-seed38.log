You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Pantry =-
You are in a pantry. A typical kind of place. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

You can see a shelf. The shelf is wooden. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

There is an open plain door leading west.

AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go west
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. A typical one.

You see a fridge. The fridge contains a white onion, a raw white tuna and a yellow onion. You make out an oven. You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. The counter is vast. But there isn't a thing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You can make out a stove. The stove appears to be empty.

There is an open plain door leading east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.
