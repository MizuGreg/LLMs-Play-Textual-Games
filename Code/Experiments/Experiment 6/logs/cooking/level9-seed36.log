You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Pantry =-
You find yourself in a pantry. A typical kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You scan the room for a shelf, and you find a shelf. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The shelf is wooden. However, the shelf, like an empty shelf, has nothing on it.

There is a closed frosted-glass door leading south.

-= Kitchen =-
I just think it's great that you've just entered a kitchen.

You can make out a fridge. You can see an oven. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a table. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. Huh, weird. You smell a lovely smell, and follow it to a counter. The counter is vast. But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

There is a closed sliding patio door leading east. There is an open frosted-glass door leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.
