You are in a bedroom. A normal one.

You can see a bed. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is in a text-based game where they need to cook a meal by finding a recipe in the kitchen. The current location is the Bedroom, and the previous movements have been alternating between the Bedroom and Livingroom. The user has been going east and west, which seems to be moving between these two rooms.

The goal is to find the cookbook in the kitchen to get the recipe. But so far, the user hasn't mentioned being in the kitchen. The Bedroom and Livingroom are the only rooms explored. The exit to the north in the Bedroom is mentioned, but the user hasn't tried that yet. Maybe the kitchen is north of the Bedroom? Or perhaps the Livingroom is connected to the kitchen somehow.

The user's next action should be to check the exit to the north in the Bedroom, as that's the only other direction mentioned. The previous movements have been back and forth between the two rooms, so maybe the kitchen is accessible from the north. Alternatively, maybe the Livingroom has a door to the kitchen. But the Livingroom's exit is only to the west, which leads back to the Bedroom. 

Since the user is in the Bedroom, the next logical step would be to go north, as that's the exit mentioned there. The cookbook is in the kitchen, so navigating to the kitchen through the north exit might be the way to go. The user hasn't checked that direction yet, so going north would be the next step to find the cookbook and complete the game.

You scan the room for a stove, and you find a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty. Sometimes, just sometimes, TextWorld can just be the worst.

There is a closed patio door leading east. There is a closed plain door leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is in a text-based game where they need to cook a meal by finding a recipe in the kitchen. So far, they've navigated through the Bedroom, Livingroom, Corridor, Bathroom, and finally reached the Kitchen. In the Kitchen, they found the cookbook, took it, and then went back through the corridors and bathroom.

The current location is the Bathroom again, with an exit to the west. The user is asking if they're making the right actions and if they're close to the goal. The original goal was to cook a meal by checking the cookbook in the kitchen. They already found the cookbook and took it, so the next step would be to use it to cook. But since they're back in the Bathroom, they need to get back to the Kitchen.

The exit to the west from the Bathroom leads back to the Corridor. So the next logical step is to go west again to return to the Corridor, then find the way back to the Kitchen. Since the user has the cookbook, they can use it in the Kitchen to cook. But they need to be in the Kitchen again. So the correct action here is to go west to the Corridor and then proceed back to the Kitchen. But the user is at the Bathroom, so the immediate next step is to go west.

You've entered a kitchen.

You see a fridge. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an oven. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a table. You see a knife on the table. You see a counter. You see a green apple, a raw purple potato, a green bell pepper, a yellow apple and a raw red potato on the counter. You scan the room for a stove, and you find a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty. Sometimes, just sometimes, TextWorld can just be the worst.

There is a closed patio door leading east. There is a closed plain door leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal in this text game. They found the cookbook in the kitchen, took it, but now they're stuck trying to use it. The problem is that the game's response says "That's not a verb I recognise" when they try to use the cookbook. So, maybe the correct action isn't "use cookbook" but something else.

Wait, the original goal was to check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. The user already took the cookbook, so maybe they need to look at it to find the recipe. But the game doesn't have a "read" command. Alternatively, maybe they need to cook the meal using the ingredients from the counter. The user has the cookbook, which probably has the recipe. But the game might require them to use the cookbook to prepare the meal by selecting ingredients.

But in the previous steps, the user tried "use cookbook" and "cook meal", which didn't work. Maybe the correct action is to "read cookbook" or "check cookbook". However, the game's responses don't recognize "read". Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the ingredients on the counter with the cookbook. For example, using the cookbook to cook the meal by selecting the ingredients like the apples, potatoes, and peppers.

But the user is at the Kitchen again, and the stove is there. Maybe the correct step is to use the cookbook to cook the meal by putting the ingredients on the stove. However, the game might require the user to "cook" the meal using the ingredients from the counter. Since the user has the cookbook, maybe they need to "cook meal" again, but the game says they can't see any such thing. Alternatively, maybe they need to use the stove and the ingredients from the counter.

Wait, the user has the cookbook, which is on the table. The ingredients are on the counter. So maybe the correct action is to "use cookbook" to find the recipe, then "put ingredients on stove" or something similar. But the game's responses don't recognize those commands. Maybe the user needs to "cook" the meal by using the ingredients and the cookbook. But the game is not allowing that.

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to just look at the cookbook to find the recipe, but the game doesn't have a "read" command. The user might need to "look at cookbook" instead. But the game's previous response said "It isn't something you can open" when they tried to open it. So maybe the cookbook is already read, and the user needs to use it to cook the meal. But the game doesn't have a "cook" command that works with the cookbook.

Hmm, maybe the user is supposed to "cook" the meal using the ingredients from the counter. The user has the cookbook, which has the recipe. So the correct action would be to use the cookbook to cook the meal by selecting the ingredients. But the game's responses don't recognize that. The user tried "cook meal" but it didn't work. Maybe the correct action is to "use cookbook" again, but the game says that's not a verb. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "cook" the meal with the ingredients on the stove.

But the game's response says "You can't see any such thing" when trying to cook. Maybe the user needs to put the ingredients on the stove first. For example, take the apple, potato, and pepper, then cook them. But the user hasn't taken any ingredients yet. So the next step might be to take an ingredient, like the apple, then use the cookbook to cook it. But the game doesn't have a "take" command for the ingredients, or maybe it's already on the counter.

Wait, the user is in the kitchen, and the counter has the ingredients. The user can take them. So maybe the correct action is to "take apple" or "take potato", then use the cookbook to cook. But the user hasn't done that yet. The previous steps didn't involve taking ingredients. So maybe the user needs to take an ingredient, then use the cookbook to cook it. But the game's commands might not allow that.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "cook" the meal using the cookbook and the ingredients. But the game doesn't recognize the "cook" command. The user is stuck here. The correct action might be to "use cookbook" again, but the game says it's not a verb. Maybe the user needs to "look at cookbook" to find the recipe, but the game doesn't have that command. The user is in a loop here, trying to use the cookbook but getting errors.

The original goal was to check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. The user already did that by taking the cookbook. So maybe the game is expecting them to "cook" the meal using the ingredients and the recipe from the cookbook. But the game's commands don't allow that. The user might need to "cook meal" again, but it's not working. The user is stuck, so the next action should be to try something else, like taking an ingredient or using the stove.

Okay, the user is stuck in the kitchen trying to use the cookbook to cook a meal. They've tried "use cookbook" and "cook meal" multiple times, but the game isn't recognizing the commands. The original goal was to check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. The user already took the cookbook, so maybe they need to look at it to find the recipe. But the game doesn't have a "read" command. Alternatively, maybe they need to use the ingredients on the counter with the cookbook. The user hasn't taken any ingredients yet, so perhaps the next step is to take an ingredient, like an apple or potato, and then use the cookbook to cook it. But the game's commands might not allow that. The user is in a loop, so the correct action might be to try something else, like looking around again or checking the stove. But the user has already looked around. Maybe the answer is to use the cookbook in a different way, but the game doesn't recognize it. The user needs to find the right command, but it's not working. The next action should be to try "cook meal" again, but it's not working. Maybe the game expects a different command, like "prepare meal" or "make meal", but the user has to guess. Since the user is stuck, the correct action might be to try "cook meal" once more, even though it's not working.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal in the kitchen. They found the cookbook and took it, but they're stuck on using it. The game's available commands include 'use', but the user tried 'use cookbook' and it didn't work. The error says "That's not a verb I recognise." So maybe 'use' isn't the right command here.

Looking at the available commands, there's 'examine' which could be used to look at the cookbook more closely. The user might need to examine the cookbook to find the recipe. Alternatively, since the cookbook is on the table, maybe they need to take it again or check their inventory. Wait, the user already took the cookbook, so it's in their inventory. But the game might require them to examine it to read the recipe.

Another possibility is that the user needs to use the ingredients on the counter. The cookbook might have a recipe that uses the ingredients like apples, potatoes, etc. So maybe the next step is to take an ingredient, like an apple, and then use the cookbook to cook it. But the commands don't have a 'cook' action, so maybe 'use' with the ingredient and the cookbook?

Alternatively, the user might need to look at the stove and use the cookbook to prepare the meal. But the game's commands don't have a direct way to do that. The correct action here is probably to examine the cookbook to find the recipe, which would then allow them to cook the meal using the ingredients. So the next command should be 'examine cookbook' to check the recipe.

Okay, the user is in the kitchen and has the cookbook. They followed the recipe which requires green apple, orange bell pepper, and purple potato. They took the green apple and purple potato, but the orange bell pepper isn't available. The user tried to take it again but couldn't. The next step is to find the orange bell pepper. Maybe it's on the counter but not visible. The user needs to check the counter again or look around. The correct action would be to take the orange bell pepper from the counter. But the game says it's not there. Wait, maybe the user needs to examine the counter or the ingredients again. Alternatively, maybe the orange bell pepper is already in the inventory, but the user didn't realize. But the user has the green apple and purple potato. The recipe requires all three. So the missing item is the orange bell pepper. The user needs to take it. The command should be 'take orange bell pepper' again. Even though the game says it's not there, maybe the user needs to try again. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to look at the counter again. But the user has to use the correct command. So the next action is to take the orange bell pepper.

Okay, the user is trying to cook a meal using the recipe from the cookbook. They have the green apple and purple potato, but need the orange bell pepper. However, the game's inventory is full, so they can't take more items. The recipe requires all three ingredients: green apple, orange bell pepper, and purple potato. The user has the green apple and purple potato, but the orange bell pepper isn't available. Wait, in the current room description, the user sees a green bell pepper on the counter. Maybe the user confused "orange bell pepper" with "green bell pepper". The recipe says "orange bell pepper", but the game has a "green bell pepper". Maybe that's a mistake in the game's setup. The user needs to take the green bell pepper instead. But the user is already carrying the green apple and purple potato, which is two items. The game allows carrying three items, so maybe the user can take the green bell pepper. But the user tried taking it and got "You're carrying too many things already." So maybe the user needs to drop one of the existing items to take the pepper. The correct action would be to drop the green apple or purple potato to make space. But the user hasn't done that yet. The next step is to drop one of the items to take the pepper. However, the user is stuck because they can't carry more. So the correct action is to drop an item to free up space.

Okay, the user has the green bell pepper now, along with the purple potato. They need to use the cookbook to cook the meal. The previous attempt to use the cookbook failed because "use" isn't a valid command. The available commands include "examine", "take", "drop", "look", etc. Maybe the correct action is to examine the cookbook again to find the recipe steps. Alternatively, since the user has all the ingredients, they might need to cook the meal by following the directions. The recipe says to slice, fry, chop, grill, slice, roast, and prepare the meal. The user might need to use the stove and the ingredients. But the game's commands don't have a "cook" action. The next step is to follow the recipe steps using the available commands. The user should probably use the stove and the ingredients to prepare the meal. The correct command might be "cook" but it's not recognized. Alternatively, the user needs to use the stove and the ingredients. The answer is to use the stove and the ingredients as per the recipe.

Okay, the user is stuck again. They have the ingredients and the cookbook but can't proceed. The previous attempts to use the cookbook or cook the meal failed. The available commands include 'examine', 'look', 'take', 'drop', 'use', 'open', etc. The user needs to follow the recipe steps from the cookbook. The recipe says to slice the green apple, fry it, chop the orange bell pepper, grill it, slice the purple potato, roast it, and prepare the meal. The user has the green bell pepper (maybe they confused orange with green), purple potato, and the green apple. They need to use the stove and the ingredients. The correct action might be to use the stove to cook the ingredients. But the game doesn't recognize 'use stove'. Alternatively, they might need to examine the stove or the ingredients again. The next step is to examine the stove to find out how to use it. So the command should be 'examine stove'.

The recipe says to slice, fry, chop, grill, etc. The user tried "cook green apple" but it didn't work. The available commands include 'use', 'examine', 'take', 'drop', 'look'. Maybe the correct action is to use the stove to fry the green apple. The previous attempt to "use stove" failed, but maybe "fry" is a verb here.
