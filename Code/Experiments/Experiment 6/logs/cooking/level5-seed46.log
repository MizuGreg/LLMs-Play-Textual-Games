You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Bathroom =-
You're now in a bathroom.

You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a toilet. The toilet is white. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door.

GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Corridor =-
You are in a corridor. It seems to be pretty usual here. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?



There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door. There is an exit to the south.



>                                                                                                                                -= Corridor =-0/2

GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Bedroom =-
You are in a bedroom. A typical kind of place.

You can make out a bed. The bed is large. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Hm. Oh well

You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one. There is an exit to the west.



>                                                                                                                                -= Bedroom =-0/3

GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Livingroom =-
You've entered an ordinary room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be ordinary. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the livingroom. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You can make out a sofa. But there isn't a thing on it. Sometimes, just sometimes, TextWorld can just be the worst.

There is an exit to the east. There is an exit to the north.

GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. A normal one. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

You see a fridge. The fridge contains a raw red tuna, a raw red potato, a raw white tuna, a yellow bell pepper, a lettuce and a yellow onion. Oh, great. Here's an oven. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? Were you looking for a table? Because look over there, it's a table. The table is massive. But the thing is empty. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. You see a green apple, a tomato, a green hot pepper, a yellow apple, a raw yellow potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You scan the room, seeing a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.

There is an open plain door leading north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door.
