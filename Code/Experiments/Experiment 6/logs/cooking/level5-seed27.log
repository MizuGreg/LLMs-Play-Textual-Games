You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Livingroom =-
I am required to announce that you are now in the livingroom. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You can make out a sofa. The sofa is comfy. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

You need an exit without a door? You should try going south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.
