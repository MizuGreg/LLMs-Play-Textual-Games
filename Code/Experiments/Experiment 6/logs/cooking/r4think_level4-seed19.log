You've just shown up in a bedroom. The room is well lit.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a bed. The bed is large. The bed appears to be empty.

There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.

You arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a green bell pepper, a green hot pepper, a red bell pepper and a yellow onion. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a tomato and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open plain door leading west. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal using the cookbook in the kitchen. So far, they've gone through the bedroom, corridor, bathroom, and now the kitchen. In the kitchen, they found the ingredients and the cookbook. The recipe says to chop the green bell pepper, roast it, and prepare the meal.

The user just tried to "chop the green bell pepper," but the game responded that cutting something requires a knife. They have a knife on the table, so maybe they need to pick it up first. The next step would be to take the knife, then use it to chop the pepper. After chopping, they need to roast it according to the recipe. Then, once all steps are done, they can enjoy the meal. The user is close to the goal, but they need to make sure they have the knife to proceed. The next action should be to pick up the knife.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to roast the green bell pepper. The previous attempt was to use the knife, but the game didn't recognize "roast" as a verb. Maybe the correct action is to use the knife to chop the pepper first, then roast it. But the user already chopped it. Wait, the recipe says chop, roast, and prepare. Maybe after chopping, the next step is to roast it. But how? The user has the knife, so maybe they need to use the knife to roast it, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the game expects a different command. Since "roast" isn't a verb, perhaps the correct action is to put the pepper in the oven. But the oven is mentioned in the kitchen. Wait, the user has the knife, so maybe they need to use the oven. But the recipe says to roast the pepper, so maybe the next step is to put it in the oven. But the user hasn't interacted with the oven yet. Let me check the previous steps. The user has the knife, chopped the pepper, and now needs to roast it. The oven is in the kitchen. So maybe the correct action is to put the chopped pepper in the oven. But the game might require a specific command. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the knife to roast it, but that's not standard. The game might expect "roast" as a verb, but it's not recognized. Maybe the correct action is to use the oven. So the next step is to put the pepper in the oven. But how? The user needs to interact with the oven. So the next action should be to put the green bell pepper in the oven. But the user has to first have the pepper. Since they chopped it, they should have it. So the command would be "put the green bell pepper in the oven". But the game might not recognize that. Alternatively, maybe the correct verb is "roast" with the oven. But the user hasn't used the oven yet. So the next step is to use the oven to roast the pepper. The correct command might be "roast the green bell pepper in the oven". But the game might not accept that. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to open the oven. Wait, the oven is mentioned as being conventional but someone took everything off it. So maybe the oven is already open. The user needs to put the pepper inside. So the next action is to put the pepper in the oven. The correct command would be "put the green bell pepper in the oven". But the user has to make sure they have the pepper. Since they chopped it, they should have it. So the next action is to put it in the oven.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to roast the green bell pepper. They took the pepper from the fridge, but the game didn't recognize "roast" as a verb. The previous attempt was to use "roast the green bell pepper in the oven," which didn't work. Maybe the correct action is to use the oven's function. Since the oven is in the kitchen, perhaps the user needs to interact with it directly. The recipe says to roast the pepper, so maybe the next step is to put the pepper in the oven and then wait for it to roast. But the game might require a specific command. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the knife to roast it, but that's not standard. The correct command might be "put the green bell pepper in the oven" without the roast part. Or maybe "roast the green bell pepper" is not the right verb, and "cook" is the correct verb. But the game didn't recognize "cook" either. Wait, the user has the knife, so maybe they need to use the knife to chop it again, but they already chopped it. Hmm. The user needs to follow the recipe steps: chop, roast, prepare. Since they've chopped, the next step is roast. The game might expect the user to use the oven. So the correct command is to put the pepper in the oven. Let me check the previous steps. The user took the pepper, so now they need to put it in the oven. The command should be "put the green bell pepper in the oven". But the game might not accept that. Alternatively, maybe "roast the green bell pepper" is the correct verb, but the game doesn't recognize it. Maybe the user needs to use the oven's action. So the next action is to put the pepper in the oven.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe. They've gone through the kitchen, found the ingredients, chopped the green bell pepper, and now they've put it in the oven. The next step in the recipe is to "prepare the meal." So after roasting the pepper, they need to prepare it. But how? Maybe they need to take the roasted pepper out of the oven and serve it. The command would be something like "take the roasted green bell pepper from the oven" or "prepare the meal with the green bell pepper." Since the game expects a specific command, "prepare the meal" might be the correct next step. Let me check the previous steps. The recipe says after chopping and roasting, prepare the meal. So the next action is to prepare it. The user has the pepper in the oven, so maybe they need to take it out and prepare it. But the game might recognize "prepare the meal" as the command.

Okay, the user is trying to prepare a meal according to the recipe. They've chopped the green bell pepper, roasted it in the oven, and now they've taken it out. The next step is to "prepare the meal," but the game didn't recognize "prepare" as a verb. The user tried "serve the green bell pepper," but that's not a valid command either.

Looking back at the recipe, the directions are: chop, roast, prepare. Since the user has already done the first two steps, the next logical step is to prepare the meal. But the game might expect a different phrasing. Maybe "eat the green bell pepper" or "finish the meal" could work. Alternatively, since the user is in the kitchen, maybe they need to put the prepared pepper on the table or serve it. However, the game's response indicates that "prepare" isn't recognized. The user might need to use a different verb, like "cook" or "serve." But "serve" was already tried. Maybe the correct command is "finish the meal" or "complete the meal." Alternatively, since the recipe is from "Cooking: A Modern Approach," perhaps the correct action is to "prepare the meal" with the ingredients they have. But the game doesn't recognize it. The user might need to use a different approach, like "put the green bell pepper on the table" or "eat the green bell pepper." However, the goal is to enjoy the meal, so the final action might be to eat it. But the game might require the exact command. Since "prepare" isn't working, maybe the user needs to "serve" it again or use another verb. Alternatively, the game might consider "prepare the meal" as the correct command even if it's not recognized. But the user has to follow the game's rules. The next possible action is to "eat the green bell pepper" or "finish the meal." But the user has to choose the correct command. Given the previous steps, the next action should be to "prepare the meal" even if it's not recognized, or maybe "serve the green bell pepper" again. However, the user has to make a choice based on the available options. The correct answer is likely "prepare the meal" even if the game doesn't recognize it, or maybe "eat the green bell pepper." But the user has to pick the best possible command.
