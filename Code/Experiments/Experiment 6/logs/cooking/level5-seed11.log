You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Bedroom =-
You arrive in a bedroom. A typical one.

You make out a bed. The bed is large. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door.

-= Livingroom =-
This might come as a shock to you, but you've just walked into a livingroom.

Were you looking for a sofa? Because look over there, it's a sofa. The sofa is comfy. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door. There is an exit to the west.

You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one. There is an exit to the south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

-= Bathroom =-
You've stumbled into an ordinary room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be ordinary. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the bathroom.

You see a toilet. The toilet is white. The toilet appears to be empty.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

-= Kitchen =-
You've just walked into a kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You can see a fridge. Now that's what I call TextWorld! The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a green bell pepper and a carrot. Now why would someone leave that there? You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see an oven. You scan the room for a table, and you find a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You scan the room for a counter, and you find a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a yellow apple, a yellow onion, a green apple, a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? The stove appears to be empty. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is an open frosted-glass door leading west. There is an exit to the south.
