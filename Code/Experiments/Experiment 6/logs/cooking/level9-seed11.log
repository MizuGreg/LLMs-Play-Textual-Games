You arrive in a backyard. An ordinary one.

Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a patio chair. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a patio chair? The patio chair is stylish. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? Hey, want to see a patio table? Look over there, a patio table. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You make out a closed BBQ close by.

There is a closed patio door leading south. There is a closed wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

You arrive in a backyard. An ordinary one.

Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a patio chair. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a patio chair? The patio chair is stylish. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? Hey, want to see a patio table? Look over there, a patio table. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You make out a closed BBQ close by.

There is a closed patio door leading south. There is a closed wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

-= Backyard =-
You arrive in a backyard. An ordinary one.

Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a patio chair. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a patio chair? The patio chair is stylish. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? Hey, want to see a patio table? Look over there, a patio table. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You make out a closed BBQ close by.

There is a closed patio door leading south. There is a closed wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.
