-= Bathroom =-
Ah, the bathroom. This is some kind of bathroom, really great usual vibes in this place, a wonderful usual atmosphere. And now, well, you're in it. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

You make out a toilet. You shudder, but continue examining the toilet. The toilet is white. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Sometimes, just sometimes, TextWorld can just be the worst.

You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.
