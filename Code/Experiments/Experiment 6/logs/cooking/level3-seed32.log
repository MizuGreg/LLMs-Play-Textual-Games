You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You've entered a kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge. The fridge contains a red bell pepper, a block of cheese, a raw red tuna and a green bell pepper. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. You can see an oven. What's that over there? It looks like it's a table. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a yellow apple, a raw yellow potato, a red apple and a knife. Hey, want to see a stove? Look over there, a stove. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.
