Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the bathroom and corridor. Every time they go west, they end up back in the bathroom, and east takes them back to the corridor. The original goal was to find the cookbook in the kitchen to cook a meal. So far, the user hasn't found the kitchen yet.

The bathroom and corridor seem to be part of a larger structure. Maybe the kitchen is somewhere else. The user needs to find the kitchen to access the cookbook. But the current path is just moving between two rooms. Maybe there's another direction they haven't tried, like north. The corridor mentions an exit to the north. The user hasn't tried going north yet. 

Wait, in the corridor description, it says there's an exit to the north. The user has been going east and west, but never north. Maybe the north exit leads to the kitchen. The user should try going north to reach the kitchen and find the cookbook. That would make sense as the next step instead of continuing the loop between bathroom and corridor.

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. A standard one. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

Hey, want to see a fridge? Look over there, a fridge. You look around you, at all the containers and supporters, doors and objects, and you think to yourself. Why? Why Textworld? The fridge contains a white onion, a raw pork chop, a red bell pepper and an orange bell pepper. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You can see a closed oven in the corner. Were you looking for a table? Because look over there, it's a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a knife. You make out a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? You see a yellow apple, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a green apple, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a yellow onion, a raw purple potato, a tomato and a cookbook on the counter. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm. Oh well

There is an open frosted-glass door leading east. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user started in a bathroom, kept going back and forth between the bathroom and corridor by moving west and east. Then they finally found the kitchen, took the cookbook, put it in the oven, and closed it. Then they went east to the pantry, came back to the kitchen, and started looping again between the corridor and bathroom.

The original goal was to cook a meal using the cookbook. The user has the cookbook now, so the next step would be to use it. But in the current setup, after closing the oven, they went south to the corridor, then east to the bathroom, and back. They might not have realized that the oven is closed and needs to be opened again to cook. Alternatively, maybe they need to use the cookbook to find a recipe and then follow the steps to cook.

But in the game's current state, after putting the cookbook in the oven and closing it, the user is back in the loop. The oven was closed, so maybe they need to open it again to cook. However, the user hasn't opened it since putting the cookbook in. The last action was closing the oven. So the next logical step would be to open the oven again to use the cookbook inside. But the user is currently in the corridor, so they need to go back to the kitchen to open the oven.

Wait, the user is in the corridor again. The previous steps were going east to the bathroom, then west back to the corridor. So the user needs to go back to the kitchen. From the corridor, the exit to the north is mentioned, but the user has been going west and east. Wait, in the corridor description, there's an exit to the north. So maybe the user should go north from the corridor to get back to the kitchen. But the user has been stuck in the loop between bathroom and corridor. So the correct path would be from the corridor, go north to the kitchen, then open the oven again.

But the user's last action was going west from the corridor, leading back to the bathroom. So the user needs to find the way back to the kitchen. The corridor has an exit to the north, so going north from the corridor would lead to the kitchen. Therefore, the next action should be to go north from the corridor to reach the kitchen again, then open the oven to cook using the cookbook.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in the kitchen, trying to follow the recipe from the cookbook. They've already chopped the red apple and the yellow apple, and they just chopped the yellow apple. The next step in the recipe is to fry both apples. So after chopping, they need to fry them. But to fry, they probably need oil and a pan. Wait, the recipe doesn't mention oil, but in the kitchen, there's a stove. The user has the knife and the apples. They need to fry the apples. So the next action should be to take the apples and fry them. But the user has the yellow apple in hand after chopping. Wait, the last action was chopping the yellow apple. Now, they need to fry it. But the stove is conventional, so maybe they need to put the apples in a pan on the stove. But the user hasn't taken the pan yet. Alternatively, maybe they can just fry the apples directly. The recipe says "fry the red apple" and "fry the yellow apple". So after chopping, the next step is to fry them. The user has the knife, the red apple, and the yellow apple. They need to fry both. So the next command should be to fry the red apple and then the yellow apple. But the user is holding the yellow apple after chopping. Wait, the user took the yellow apple, chopped it, and now it's in their inventory. So maybe they need to fry the yellow apple next. But the recipe says "fry the red apple" first. Wait, the recipe's directions are:

chop the red apple
  fry the red apple
  chop the yellow apple
  fry the yellow apple
  dice the yellow potato
  roast the yellow potato
  prepare meal

So after chopping the red apple, they need to fry it. Then chop the yellow apple and fry it. The user has already chopped the red apple and the yellow apple. So next is to fry the red apple. But the user might have the red apple in their inventory. Wait, after chopping, the apple is in their inventory. So the next step is to fry the red apple. But the user is currently holding the yellow apple. Wait, no. Let me check the history.

The user took the red apple, chopped it. Then took the yellow apple, chopped it. So after chopping the yellow apple, the user is holding the yellow apple. But the recipe says after chopping the yellow apple, they need to fry it. So the next action should be to fry the yellow apple. But the recipe says "fry the red apple" after chopping it. Wait, the recipe's directions are in order. So after chopping the red apple, fry it. Then chop the yellow apple, then fry it. So the user has already chopped the red apple and the yellow apple. So the next step is to fry the red apple. But the user might have the red apple in their inventory. Wait, after chopping, the apple is in the inventory. So the user needs to fry the red apple. But the user is currently holding the yellow apple. So maybe they need to take the red apple from the inventory and fry it. Alternatively, maybe the user is holding the yellow apple after chopping, so they need to put it down and take the red apple. But the user's last action was chopping the yellow apple. So the next step is to fry the red apple. But the user might not have the red apple in hand. Wait, the user took the red apple, chopped it, so it's in their inventory. Then they took the yellow apple, chopped it. So now, the user is holding the yellow apple. So they need to fry the red apple first. So the user should put the yellow apple down and take the red apple from the inventory to fry it. But the user can't pick up the red apple if it's already in the inventory. Wait, maybe the user can just fry the red apple while holding the yellow apple. But the recipe says to fry the red apple first. So the correct next step is to fry the red apple. The user needs to use the stove. So the command would be to fry the red apple. But the user is holding the yellow apple. So maybe they need to put the yellow apple down and take the red apple. But the user can't do that. Alternatively, maybe the user can fry the red apple while holding the yellow apple. But the game might require the user to have the apple in hand. So the next action is to fry the red apple. The user has the red apple in their inventory, so they can fry it. So the next command is "fry red apple".

Okay, the user is trying to fry the red apple but keeps getting errors. Let me check the previous steps. The user has the red apple in their inventory after chopping it. The recipe says to fry the red apple after chopping. The problem is that the command "fry red apple" isn't recognized. Maybe the correct verb is "cook" or "heat". Alternatively, the user might need to use the stove. The stove is in the kitchen, so perhaps the command is "put red apple on stove" or "heat red apple on stove". Since the recipe says "fry", maybe the correct action is to use the stove and apply heat. The user might need to say "heat red apple on stove" or "cook red apple on stove". The game might expect the verb "heat" instead of "fry". Let me try that.

Okay, the user is stuck again. They tried to fry the red apple but the game doesn't recognize the command. Let me think about the possible correct actions. The recipe says to "fry the red apple," but maybe the game expects a different verb. Earlier, the user tried "heat" but that didn't work. Maybe the correct action is to "put the red apple on the stove" or "cook the red apple." Alternatively, since the stove is conventional, maybe "heat" is the right verb, but the game is strict. Wait, in the kitchen description, there's a stove. The user has the red apple. The correct command might be "put red apple on stove" or "cook red apple on stove." Let me check the previous steps. The user had to chop the apple first, then fry it. The game might require the exact phrase "fry" but with the correct object. Maybe "fry red apple" is correct, but the user is getting an error. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the stove first. Wait, the stove is empty. So perhaps the user needs to put the apple on the stove and then heat it. But the game might not accept "heat." Maybe the correct action is "cook red apple on stove." Let me try that.

Okay, the user is trying to fry the yellow apple but keeps getting errors. Let me check the previous steps. They successfully fried the red apple using "cook red apple on stove." Now, for the yellow apple, maybe the correct command is "cook yellow apple on stove." The game might require the verb "cook" instead of "fry" or "heat." Alternatively, since the recipe says "fry," maybe the correct action is "fry yellow apple on stove." But the user tried "fry yellow apple" and got an error. Maybe the game expects "cook" as the verb. Let me try "cook yellow apple on stove."

Okay, the user has fried both the red and yellow apples. The next step in the recipe is to dice the yellow potato and roast it. So after frying the apples, they need to handle the potato. The user has the yellow potato on the counter. The next action should be to take the yellow potato, dice it, then roast it. Let me check the previous steps. The user has the knife from the table. So first, take the yellow potato, then dice it. Then roast it. The recipe says "dice the yellow potato" and "roast the yellow potato". So the next command is to dice the yellow potato.

Okay, the user has taken the yellow potato. The next step is to dice it. They have the knife, so they can use that. The command should be "dice yellow potato with knife". Let me check if that's the correct format. The previous actions used "chop" and "fry", so "dice" might be the right verb here. Alternatively, maybe "cut" instead of "dice", but the recipe says "dice". So the next action is to dice the potato.

Okay, the user is trying to roast the yellow potato but keeps getting errors. Let me check the previous steps. They diced the potato, and the recipe says to roast it. The correct verb might be "roast" but the game doesn't recognize it. Maybe the user needs to use the stove again. The stove is in the kitchen, so perhaps the command is "put yellow potato on stove" or "heat yellow potato on stove". Alternatively, since the user previously used "cook" for frying, maybe "cook" is the correct verb here. Let me try "cook yellow potato on stove".
