You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. A normal one.

You can make out a fridge. The fridge contains a red onion, a raw red tuna, an orange bell pepper and a lettuce. You smell an intriguing smell, and follow it to an oven, so there's that. You can make out a table. The table is massive. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You make out a counter. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a red hot pepper, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper, a yellow onion, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

Okay, let's see. The user is in a kitchen, and their goal is to cook a delicious meal. They found the cookbook on the counter, but it isn't something you can open. So, maybe the next step is to look for ingredients to make a recipe. The fridge has a red onion, raw red tuna, orange bell pepper, and lettuce. The counter has a raw yellow potato, red hot pepper, red apple, yellow bell pepper, yellow onion, raw purple potato, a cookbook, and a knife. The oven is present, so maybe they need to prepare something to cook.

Since the cookbook isn't openable, perhaps the user needs to find a recipe manually. Maybe they can look for ingredients that go together. The oven is there, so maybe they need to prepare a dish that can be baked. The user has a knife, so they might need to chop ingredients. The fridge has some items, but the counter has more. Maybe they should take some ingredients from the counter to start cooking. The next logical step would be to take an ingredient from the counter, like the yellow onion or the red hot pepper, to use in a recipe. Alternatively, maybe they can use the knife to prepare an ingredient. But since the cookbook isn't openable, maybe the user needs to figure out the recipe without it. So the next action should be to take an ingredient from the counter to start cooking.

Okay, the user has taken the yellow onion from the counter. The goal is to cook a meal. They have the cookbook, but it's not openable. So maybe they need to use the ingredients available. The oven is in the kitchen, so perhaps they need to prepare something to bake. The yellow onion is a good start. Next, they might need to chop it with the knife. But the knife is on the counter. Wait, the user has the onion, but the knife is still there. So maybe they should take the knife next. Alternatively, they could use the onion and another ingredient to make a dish. But since the cookbook isn't open, maybe they need to proceed without it. The next step could be to use the knife on the onion to chop it. But the user hasn't taken the knife yet. So the next action should be to take the knife from the counter. Alternatively, maybe they can start cooking with the onion directly. But the oven requires preparation. So taking the knife first makes sense. Let me check the items again. The counter has a knife. So take the knife.

Okay, the user tried to cut the yellow onion with the knife. The system responded that it was only understood up to wanting to cut the onion. So maybe the action wasn't successful. The next step would be to check if the onion is chopped. If not, perhaps they need to try again or use another method. Alternatively, maybe they need to look for another ingredient. Since the goal is to cook a meal, maybe they should try to prepare a dish using the available ingredients. The oven is available, so perhaps they need to put the chopped onion into the oven. But first, they need to chop it. Let me check the items again. They have the knife and the onion. So the next action should be to chop the onion again. Alternatively, maybe they can use the oven directly. But the oven is empty. Maybe they need to put the onion into the oven. But the user hasn't chopped it yet. So the correct next step is to chop the onion with the knife.

Okay, the user is trying to cook a meal in the kitchen. They've taken the yellow onion and knife, tried to cut it, but the system isn't recognizing the action. Then they tried putting the onion in the oven, but the oven is closed. So the next step should be to open the oven. Since the oven is closed, they can't put anything in. So the correct action is to open the oven first. Let me check the previous steps. The user had the onion, tried to cut it, but maybe the cutting wasn't successful. Then they tried putting it in the oven, but it's closed. So the next logical step is to open the oven. The command should be "open the oven".

Okay, the user is trying to cook an onion in the oven. They put the onion in, but now they need to wait for it to cook. The system responded that "wait for the onion to cook" was only understood as waiting. So maybe the next step is to check if the onion is cooked. Alternatively, perhaps they need to do something else while waiting. But since the goal is to enjoy the meal, maybe after cooking, they need to take it out and eat it. But the user hasn't eaten anything yet. So the next action should be to take the cooked onion from the oven. Let me check the previous steps. The onion was put in the oven, and now it's cooking. So the next step is to take it out once it's done. But how does the game know when it's cooked? Maybe the user needs to check the oven. But the oven is open now. So the correct action is to take the cooked onion from the oven.
