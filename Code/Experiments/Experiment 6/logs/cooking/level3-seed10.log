You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

You're now in a kitchen.

You make out an opened fridge close by. The fridge contains a green bell pepper, a yellow onion, a lettuce, an orange bell pepper, a carrot, a raw white tuna, a block of cheese, a green apple, a green hot pepper, a yellow apple and a red onion. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can see an oven. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a table. You see a cookbook on the table. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a red hot pepper, a tomato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a red apple and a knife. You can see a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You move on, clearly upset with TextWorld.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe in the cookbook. The recipe requires green bell pepper, yellow onion, and yellow potato. So far, they've checked the fridge and counter, and found all the necessary ingredients. The next steps are to dice the green bell pepper, fry it, slice the yellow onion, fry it, slice the yellow potato, and fry it. Then prepare the meal.

The user has already looked in the fridge and counter, and found all the ingredients. Now they need to start preparing the ingredients. The next logical step would be to take the green bell pepper and dice it. But wait, the user is in the kitchen, so they need to pick up the ingredients first. Let me check the available items again.

In the fridge: green bell pepper, yellow onion, lettuce, orange bell pepper, carrot, raw white tuna, block of cheese, green apple, green hot pepper, yellow apple, red onion.

On the counter: raw yellow potato, red hot pepper, tomato, yellow bell pepper, raw red potato, red apple, knife.

So the ingredients needed are green bell pepper (from fridge), yellow onion (from fridge or counter?), and yellow potato (from counter). The recipe says "yellow onion" and "yellow potato". The user has the yellow onion in the fridge, so they can take it. The yellow potato is on the counter. So the next steps are to take the green bell pepper, yellow onion, and yellow potato. Then dice the pepper, fry it, slice the onion, fry it, slice the potato, fry it, and prepare the meal.

But the user hasn't picked up any ingredients yet. So the first action should be to take the green bell pepper from the fridge. Then dice it. But the user's last action was looking at the cookbook, so the next step is to take the green bell pepper. Wait, but the user is in the kitchen, and the fridge is nearby. So the user needs to take the green bell pepper from the fridge. Then dice it. Then proceed with the other steps.

But the user's previous actions were looking around, checking the fridge, counter, etc. Now, the next step is to take the green bell pepper. So the command should be "take green bell pepper from fridge". But the user might need to first go to the fridge. Wait, the user is already in the kitchen, and the fridge is close by. So the user can take the green bell pepper from the fridge. Then dice it. Then move on to the yellow onion and potato.

But the user's last action was looking at the cookbook, so the next step is to take the green bell pepper. So the correct command is "take green bell pepper from fridge".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to dice the green bell pepper but keeps getting errors. The problem is that the command "dice green bell pepper" is prompting for a tool, like a knife. But the user tried "use knife" and got an error. Wait, maybe the correct command is to use the knife on the pepper. But the system says "That's not a verb I recognise." Hmm.

Wait, in the game, maybe the correct action is to "slice" the pepper instead of "dice"? Or perhaps the user needs to first take the knife from the counter. The counter has a knife. So maybe the user hasn't picked up the knife yet. The user is in the kitchen, and the knife is on the counter. So the steps would be: take the knife from the counter, then use it to dice the pepper. But the user hasn't done that yet. The previous attempts were trying to use the knife without taking it first. So the next step should be to take the knife from the counter. Then, use it to dice the green bell pepper. So the correct command would be "take knife from counter" first. Then "use knife on green bell pepper" or "dice green bell pepper with knife". But the game might expect a specific verb. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "slice" the pepper with the knife. But the recipe says "dice", so maybe the correct action is to "dice" the pepper, but the system is expecting the user to have the knife available. So the user needs to take the knife first. Therefore, the next action should be to take the knife from the counter.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to fry the green bell pepper. They've already diced it, but now they need to fry it. The previous attempts to use verbs like "fry" or "heat" didn't work. Maybe the correct command is to "put" the diced pepper into the pan. Alternatively, maybe they need to "cook" it. But the recipe says "fry the green bell pepper," so perhaps the correct action is to use the stove to fry it. Wait, the user has the knife and the pan is available. Maybe the command is "fry green bell pepper on stove." But the system didn't recognize "fry." Alternatively, maybe "cook green bell pepper" or "heat green bell pepper." But the user needs to use the stove. Maybe the correct command is "use stove to fry green bell pepper." But the system might expect a different phrasing. Alternatively, since the user has the knife, maybe they need to "slice" it again, but that's already done. Hmm. The user needs to proceed with the next step in the recipe. The next step after dicing is to fry it. So perhaps the correct command is "fry green bell pepper," but the system says it's not a verb. Maybe the user needs to "put" the pepper into the pan. Or "heat" the pan first. Wait, the user tried "heat pan" and it didn't work. Maybe the correct action is "put green bell pepper in pan." But the system might expect a specific command. Alternatively, "cook green bell pepper." But the user is stuck. The next step is to fry the pepper, so maybe the correct command is "fry green bell pepper with pan." But the system says that's not a verb. Maybe the user needs to "use pan to fry green bell pepper." But the system might not recognize that. Alternatively, the user might need to "heat pan" first, then "add green bell pepper." But the user tried "heat pan" and it didn't work. Maybe the correct command is "put green bell pepper in pan." But I'm not sure. The user needs to proceed, so the next action is likely "fry green bell pepper," even though the system says it's not a verb. Maybe the system expects "cook" instead. But the recipe says "fry." Alternatively, the user might need to "use stove to fry green bell pepper." But the system might not recognize that. The user is stuck, so the next action is probably "fry green bell pepper," even if it's not recognized. Alternatively, "cook green bell pepper." But the user needs to follow the recipe. So the answer is "fry green bell pepper."

Okay, the user is trying to slice the yellow onion. The previous attempt resulted in a message saying "Cutting something requires a knife." So, the user needs to use the knife to slice the onion. The knife is already in their inventory since they took it from the counter earlier. So the next step is to use the knife on the yellow onion. The correct command would be "slice yellow onion with knife" or "use knife on yellow onion". But the game might expect a specific phrasing. Since the user is at the step where they need to slice the onion, the next action should be to use the knife on it. The previous error was because they tried to slice without specifying the tool. So the correct command is "use knife on yellow onion".

Okay, the user is trying to slice the yellow onion but needs to take it first. The previous attempt to use the knife on the onion didn't work because the onion wasn't in the inventory. So the correct step is to take the yellow onion from its current location. The yellow onion is in the fridge, as per the initial inventory. So the command should be "take yellow onion from fridge". That way, the user picks up the onion, then can use the knife to slice it.

The user needs to take the yellow potato from the counter. The counter has a raw yellow potato. So the correct command is "take yellow potato from counter". Then, they can use the knife to slice it. But the user hasn't taken the potato yet. So the next action should be to take the yellow potato from the counter.

Okay, the user is trying to fry the yellow potato. The previous steps involved slicing the potato, but now they need to fry it. The user has the knife and the potato. The correct command would be to use the stove to fry the potato. But the system might expect a specific verb. Since the user tried "fry" and it didn't work, maybe they need to "cook" or "heat" it. Alternatively, they might need to "put" the potato in the pan. But the recipe says "fry the yellow potato," so the correct action is likely "fry yellow potato with pan." However, the system might not recognize that. The user needs to use the stove to fry it. So the next command should be "fry yellow potato on stove" or similar. But the system says "That's not a verb I recognise." So maybe the correct command is "cook yellow potato" or "heat yellow potato." But the user is stuck. The next step is to fry the potato, so the answer is "fry yellow potato."

You're now in a kitchen.

You make out an opened fridge close by. The fridge contains a lettuce, an orange bell pepper, a carrot, a raw white tuna, a block of cheese, a green apple, a green hot pepper, a yellow apple and a red onion. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can see an oven. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a table. You see a cookbook on the table. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter. On the counter you see a red hot pepper, a tomato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato and a red apple. You can see a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You move on, clearly upset with TextWorld.

Okay, the user is trying to prepare the meal but the system says something still needs to be cooked. Let me check the recipe again. The recipe says to dice the green bell pepper, fry it, slice the yellow onion, fry it, slice the yellow potato, fry it, and then prepare the meal. The user has done all those steps except maybe the last part. Wait, the user might have missed a step. The recipe says "prepare meal" after frying all three ingredients. But the system says something still needs to be cooked. Maybe the user hasn't actually combined the ingredients or maybe there's another step. Alternatively, maybe the oven needs to be used. But the recipe doesn't mention the oven. Wait, the user has the ingredients: green bell pepper, yellow onion, yellow potato, all fried. The next step is to prepare the meal, which might mean combining them. But the game might require a specific action. The user tried "prepare meal" and got a message that something still needs to be cooked. Maybe the user needs to put the cooked ingredients into the oven or something. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the oven to bake the meal. But the recipe says to fry, not bake. Hmm. The user might need to check the oven. But the oven is in the kitchen. The user hasn't used it yet. Maybe the correct step is to use the oven to cook the meal. But the recipe says to fry, so maybe that's not right. Alternatively, the user might need to "put" the fried ingredients into the oven. But the system says something still needs to be cooked. Maybe the user needs to cook the meal in the oven. So the next action is to use the oven. The command would be "put cooked ingredients in oven" or "cook meal in oven". But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next step is to use the oven to cook the meal. The correct command is "use oven to cook meal" or "cook meal in oven". But the system might expect a different phrasing. The user needs to try that.

But the oven is already in the kitchen. The user might need to use the oven to cook the meal. The correct command could be "put meal in oven" or "cook in oven". Since the system doesn't recognize "cook meal in oven", maybe the user needs to specify the ingredients. The meal consists of the fried ingredients, so the command could be "put fried green bell pepper, fried yellow onion, and fried yellow potato in oven". But the user might not have those items in their inventory. Alternatively, the user might need to "use oven" without specifying. The correct action is likely "use oven to cook meal" but the system doesn't recognize it. The user needs to try a different command. The next step is to put the cooked ingredients into the oven. So the command is "put meal in oven".

Okay, the user is stuck again. They've tried using the oven multiple times but keep getting errors. Let me check the previous steps. The user has fried the green bell pepper, yellow onion, and yellow potato. The recipe says to "prepare the meal" after frying. Maybe the correct step is to "put the fried ingredients into the oven" or "use the oven to bake the meal". But the system isn't recognizing "use oven to cook meal".
