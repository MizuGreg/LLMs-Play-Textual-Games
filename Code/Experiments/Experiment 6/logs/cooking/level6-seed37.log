I am excited to announce that you are now in the bedroom. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a bed. The bed appears to be empty.

You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.

There is an open plain door leading south.

You make out an opened fridge. The fridge is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You make out an opened oven. The oven is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You make out a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh, great. Here's a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The counter is vast. But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You can see a stove. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What's the point of an empty stove?

There is an open plain door leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

You're now in a pantry. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You make out a shelf. The shelf is wooden. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm. Oh well

There is an open plain door leading south.

Look at that notice! What does it say? It says Welcome to the kitchen? Well that's cool. The room is well lit.

You make out an opened fridge. The fridge is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You make out an opened oven. The oven is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You make out a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh, great. Here's a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The counter is vast. But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You can see a stove. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What's the point of an empty stove?

There is an open plain door leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

Well how about that, you are in a place we're calling a livingroom. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.
