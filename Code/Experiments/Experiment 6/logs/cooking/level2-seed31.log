You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You've seen better kitchens, but at least this one seems pretty usual. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You can see a fridge. The fridge contains a lettuce and a white onion. You can make out an oven. You wonder idly who left that here. You smell a pungent smell, and follow it to a table. You shudder, but continue examining the table. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a counter. On the counter you can make out a yellow apple, a yellow onion and a green apple. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.
