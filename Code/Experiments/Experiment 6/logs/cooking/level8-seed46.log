You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Bathroom =-
You've entered a bathroom. Let's see what's in here.

You make out a toilet. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a toilet, go to TextWorld. However, the toilet, like an empty toilet, has nothing on it.

There is an exit to the south.

-= Corridor =-
You find yourself in a corridor. A normal kind of place. Let's see what's in here.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one. There is an exit to the south.

GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Bedroom =-
You are in a bedroom. A typical kind of place.

You can make out a bed. The bed is large. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Hm. Oh well

You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one. There is an exit to the west.



>                                                                                                                                -= Bedroom =-0/3
AGENT -------------------------------------------------

GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Livingroom =-
You've entered an ordinary room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be ordinary. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the livingroom. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You can make out a sofa. But there isn't a thing on it. Sometimes, just sometimes, TextWorld can just be the worst.

There is an exit to the east. There is an exit to the north.



>                                                                                                                                -= Livingroom =-0/4
AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go north
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. An usual one. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You see a fridge. Oh, great. Here's an oven. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? Were you looking for a table? Because look over there, it's a table. The table is massive. But the thing is empty. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. You see a green apple, a raw yellow potato, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a green hot pepper, a yellow apple, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You scan the room, seeing a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.

There is a closed plain door leading north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door.
