You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
Well, here we are in a kitchen. You begin looking for stuff.

You make out a fridge. The fridge contains a lettuce and a yellow bell pepper. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's an oven. Now that's what I call TextWorld! What's that over there? It looks like it's a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. Hey, want to see a counter? Look over there, a counter! The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a green hot pepper, a green apple, a yellow apple, an orange bell pepper, a yellow onion, a raw red potato and a cookbook. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me figure out what to do next. The user is in a text-based kitchen game where they need to cook a meal using the ingredients from the cookbook. So far, they've collected the green apple, green hot pepper, and yellow potato. The recipe requires chopping, frying, slicing, roasting, dicing, and frying those ingredients.

Looking at the current state, the user has the three ingredients. The next steps would be to process them according to the recipe. The directions say to chop the green apple, fry it, slice the green hot pepper, roast it, dice the yellow potato, and fry it. Then prepare the meal.

But in the game, the actions available are likely based on the objects present. The user has the ingredients, so they need to perform the required actions on them. The previous actions were taking the ingredients, so now they need to apply the cooking actions. However, the game might require specific commands like "chop green apple" or "fry green apple". 

Wait, the user has already taken the ingredients, so the next step is to process them. The recipe's directions are in order, so maybe the user needs to perform each action step by step. But the game might not allow arbitrary actions; they have to use the available verbs. The user has the ingredients, so they need to chop, fry, slice, roast, dice, and fry again. 

But the user's last action was taking the yellow potato. Now, they need to proceed with the next step in the recipe. The next step after taking the ingredients is to chop the green apple. So the next command should be "chop green apple". Alternatively, maybe the game requires using the tools available, like the knife on the counter. But the user hasn't used the knife yet. Wait, the counter has a knife. So maybe the user needs to use the knife to chop the apple. But the game's commands might be more direct. 

Looking at the previous interactions, the user took the ingredients, and the game gave points for each correct action. The next logical step is to perform the first action in the recipe: chop the green apple. So the correct command would be "chop green apple". That makes sense because the recipe says to chop the green apple first. So the user should do that next.

Okay, the user is trying to chop the green apple but keeps getting the message "What do you want to chop the green apple with?" and "You can't see any such thing." Hmm, maybe the knife isn't available or not in the right place. Let me check the environment again.

Earlier, the user looked at the counter and saw a knife there. So the knife should be on the counter. But when they tried to use it, it didn't work. Maybe the knife isn't equipped yet. Wait, in some text games, you have to pick up the knife first before using it. The user hasn't taken the knife yet. Oh, right! The user has been taking ingredients but didn't take the knife. So the next step should be to take the knife from the counter, then use it to chop the apple. Let me confirm: the counter has a knife. So the correct sequence is take knife, then use it on the apple. But the user is stuck trying to chop without the knife. So the next action should be to take the knife first.

Okay, the user is trying to chop the green apple using the knife but keeps getting errors. The previous attempts used "use knife on green apple" and "use knife to chop green apple", but the game doesn't recognize those. Maybe the correct command is just "chop green apple" without specifying the knife. But earlier, the user tried "chop green apple" and got asked what to chop it with. So perhaps the game expects the user to use the knife first.

Wait, the user just took the knife from the table. Now, maybe the correct action is to "chop green apple" again, assuming the knife is already in hand. But the game might require the exact phrase "use knife on green apple". Alternatively, maybe the game uses "cut" instead of "chop". Or perhaps the correct command is "cut green apple with knife".

But the user has tried "chop green apple" and "use knife on green apple" multiple times. The game's error messages suggest that "use knife on" is not valid. Maybe the correct verb is "chop" without specifying the tool, and the game assumes the knife is available. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "cut" the apple instead of "chop". Let me think about the possible commands. The recipe says "chop the green apple", so the correct action is likely "chop green apple". The previous error was because the user didn't specify the tool, but now that the knife is taken, maybe the game allows "chop" without specifying. Alternatively, the game might require "cut" instead of "chop". But the recipe says "chop", so maybe the correct command is "chop green apple" again. The user should try that.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, the user is trying to roast the green hot pepper but keeps getting an error. Let me check the previous steps. The recipe says to "roast the green hot pepper", so the correct action should be "roast green hot pepper". But the game is saying that's not a recognized verb. Maybe the game uses a different term, like "bake" instead of "roast"? Or perhaps the user needs to use the oven. Wait, the oven is in the kitchen. The user hasn't used the oven yet. Maybe the correct action is to "put green hot pepper in oven" or "roast in oven". Alternatively, the game might require the user to use the verb "roast" with the oven as the object. Let me think about the possible commands. The user has the knife and the ingredients. The oven is an object in the room. So maybe the correct command is "roast green hot pepper in oven" or "put green hot pepper in oven to roast". But the game might expect a different phrasing. Alternatively, the user might need to "cook" the pepper. But the recipe specifically says "roast". Since the user is stuck, maybe the next step is to try using the oven. So the correct action would be to put the green hot pepper in the oven to roast it. The command might be "put green hot pepper in oven" or "roast green hot pepper in oven". Let me check the previous commands. The user tried "roast green hot pepper" and it didn't work. So perhaps the correct command is "put green hot pepper in oven". That makes sense because the oven is the appliance used for roasting. So the next action should be to put the green hot pepper in the oven.

Okay, the user is trying to roast the green hot pepper in the oven but keeps getting errors. Let me think about the possible commands. The previous attempts used "roast green hot pepper in oven", which the game doesn't recognize. Maybe the correct verb is " bake" instead of "roast"? Or perhaps the game expects the user to use "put" instead of "roast". Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "cook" the pepper in the oven. But the recipe says "roast". Wait, the user already put the pepper in the oven. Maybe the next step is to "close the oven" after putting it in, but the oven was already closed. Or maybe the game requires the user to "heat" the oven first. Alternatively, the correct command is "roast green hot pepper", without mentioning the oven, assuming it's done in the oven. But earlier, when the user tried "roast green hot pepper", it didn't work. Maybe the game expects the user to use the verb "roast" with the oven as the object. But the user tried that. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "cook" the pepper. Let me check the previous steps. The user opened the oven and put the pepper in. Now, maybe the correct action is to "roast" the pepper in the oven, but the game doesn't recognize it. Maybe the correct command is "cook green hot pepper in oven". But the recipe says "roast". Hmm. Alternatively, the user might need to "heat" the oven first. But the oven is already open. I'm not sure. The user is stuck, so maybe the next step is to try a different verb like "bake" or "cook".

Okay, the user is stuck trying to fry the yellow potato. Let me think about the possible commands. The previous attempts used "fry yellow potato in pan" and "use pan to fry yellow potato", which the game doesn't recognize. Maybe the correct verb is "cook" instead of "fry"? Or perhaps the game expects the user to use "heat" the pan first. Alternatively, the user might need to "put" the potato in the pan. But the recipe says "fry". Wait, the user has the knife and the yellow potato. Maybe the correct action is to "fry yellow potato" without specifying the pan, assuming it's done in the pan. But the game doesn't recognize "fry". Maybe the correct verb is "cook" or "heat". Alternatively, the user needs to "put yellow potato in pan" first. Let me check the previous steps. The user diced the potato, so maybe the next step is to put it in the pan to fry. The command might be "put yellow potato in pan". But the game might expect "fry" as the verb. Since the user is stuck, maybe the next step is to try "cook yellow potato in pan".
