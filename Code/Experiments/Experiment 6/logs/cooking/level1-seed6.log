You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You've just sauntered into a kitchen. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."

You can see a fridge. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a raw pork chop and a red onion. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. You see a closed oven, which looks conventional, in the corner. Were you looking for a table? Because look over there, it's a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a yellow apple, a raw yellow potato, a green apple, a green hot pepper and a cookbook. You can see a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in a kitchen, and their goal is to cook a meal. They checked the cookbook, but it wasn't openable. So, what's the next step?

First, the user found items in the fridge: orange bell pepper, raw pork chop, red onion. On the table, there's a knife, a massive table, and the cookbook. The stove is empty. The counter has a yellow apple, raw yellow potato, green apple, green hot pepper, and the cookbook.

Since the cookbook is closed, maybe they need to find a way to open it. But the user tried to open it and it wasn't possible. Maybe the cookbook is in a different location? Wait, the user is in the kitchen, and the cookbook is on the counter. Maybe they need to pick it up first. But the user hasn't picked it up yet. The previous action was trying to open it, but it wasn't openable. So maybe the cookbook is closed, and they need to find a way to open it. Alternatively, maybe the cookbook is a puzzle item that needs to be interacted with in a different way.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to collect ingredients first. The fridge has some ingredients, and the counter has others. The stove is empty, so maybe they need to put ingredients on the stove. But the user hasn't done that yet. The goal is to cook a meal, so perhaps they need to gather ingredients, then use the stove or oven.

Wait, the user is hungry and needs to cook. The cookbook is closed, so maybe they need to open it first to find the recipe. But the user tried to open it and it wasn't possible. Maybe the cookbook is in a different place, but according to the description, it's on the counter. So maybe the user needs to pick up the cookbook first, then try to open it. But the user hasn't picked it up yet. The previous action was trying to open it, which didn't work. So perhaps the next step is to pick up the cookbook, then try to open it again. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to find a way to open it, like using a key or something else. But there's no mention of a key here.

Alternatively, maybe the user should look for the recipe in another way. The fridge has ingredients, the stove is empty. Maybe the user needs to use the stove to cook the ingredients. But without a recipe, it's hard to know which ingredients to use. The cookbook is supposed to have the recipe, but it's closed. So the user needs to open it. But the user tried to open it and it wasn't possible. Maybe the user needs to find a way to open it, like using the knife from the table. Or maybe the cookbook is a puzzle that needs to be interacted with in a different way.

Wait, the user is in the kitchen, and the cookbook is on the counter. The user can see it. The previous action was trying to open it, but it wasn't openable. So maybe the user needs to pick it up first. The user hasn't done that yet. So the next action should be to pick up the cookbook. Then, maybe try to open it. But the user's last action was trying to open it, which didn't work. So maybe the user needs to pick up the cookbook first. Let me check the available actions again.

The user can see the cookbook on the counter. So the possible actions are to pick it up. Then, maybe open it. But the user tried to open it and it wasn't openable. So maybe the user needs to pick it up first. The next action should be to pick up the cookbook. Then, try to open it. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next step is to pick up the cookbook. Then, maybe open it. But the user's previous action was trying to open it, which didn't work. So maybe the user needs to pick it up first. Therefore, the next action is to pick up the cookbook.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a kitchen, and their goal is to cook a delicious meal. They found the cookbook on the counter and picked it up. Now, they need to figure out the next step.

First, the original instruction was to check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. The user has already done that by picking up the cookbook. So the next logical step would be to look through the cookbook to find a recipe. But the previous attempt to open the cookbook didn't work. Maybe the cookbook is closed, so they need to open it first. Wait, the user tried to open it but it wasn't possible. Then they picked it up. Maybe now that they have it, they can try opening it again. Alternatively, maybe they need to look at the cookbook to find a recipe, even if it's closed. But the game might require opening it to read the recipe. Since the first attempt to open failed, maybe the user needs to try opening it again. Or perhaps the cookbook is already open, and the user needs to check its contents. But the user hasn't read it yet. So the next action should be to open the cookbook. But the previous attempt to open it was unsuccessful. Maybe the user needs to try opening it again. Alternatively, maybe they need to look at the cookbook to find a recipe without opening it. But the game might require opening it. So the next action is to open the cookbook.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal using the cookbook in the kitchen. They found the cookbook on the counter but couldn't open it. So far, they've tried opening it, but it didn't work. The goal is to cook a delicious meal, so the next step would be to figure out how to use the cookbook.

Hmm, maybe the cookbook is locked or needs a key. Wait, the user is in a kitchen with a fridge, oven, stove, and a table. They have items like a knife, vegetables, and pork chop. Maybe the recipe requires using those items. But the cookbook isn't opening, so perhaps they need to find a way to access the recipe. Alternatively, maybe the cookbook is a book that needs to be read, but the game doesn't allow opening it. 

Wait, the user tried "open cookbook" but it didn't work. Maybe the correct action is to "read cookbook" or "look at cookbook". But the game's previous responses didn't accept that. Alternatively, maybe the cookbook is in a different location. Wait, the user already picked it up from the counter. So the problem is that they can't open it. Maybe the game expects them to use the items from the fridge or other places to make a meal. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the stove or oven. But the stove is empty. The fridge has ingredients. Maybe the next step is to use the ingredients from the fridge to cook something. But the user needs the recipe from the cookbook. Since the cookbook isn't opening, perhaps the game is expecting them to look for another way. Wait, maybe the cookbook is a book that can be read by looking at it, but the game's interface doesn't allow that. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the knife to cut something. But the original goal is to cook a meal, so maybe the next step is to use the ingredients from the fridge and the table to make a dish. But without the recipe, it's unclear. Wait, the user is supposed to check the cookbook for the recipe. Since the cookbook isn't opening, maybe the game is expecting them to try another action, like looking at the cookbook again or using the knife on it. But the previous attempts didn't work. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to find a way to access the recipe through another item. For example, maybe the knife can be used to open the cookbook. But the game's previous response said it wasn't something you can open. So perhaps the correct action is to try using the knife on the cookbook. But the user hasn't tried that yet. Wait, the user has a knife on the table. So maybe the next step is to use the knife on the cookbook. But the game might not allow that. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to look for another way to get the recipe. Since the cookbook is in their inventory, maybe they need to read it. But the game doesn't allow opening. Maybe the answer is to try "read cookbook" even though it's not allowed. But the user has to follow the game's commands. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to use the ingredients from the fridge and the table to cook something, even without the recipe. But the original instruction says to check the cookbook for the recipe. So the user is stuck because they can't open the cookbook. Maybe the game is expecting them to try another action, like looking at the oven or stove. But the original goal is to cook a meal, so the next step is to use the ingredients. 

Wait, the user has a raw pork chop and other ingredients. Maybe the next step is to cook the pork chop using the stove. But the stove is empty. So maybe the user needs to put the pork chop on the stove. But the game might require the recipe. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to find a way to open the cookbook. Since the previous attempt failed, maybe the correct action is to try "look at cookbook" or "examine cookbook". But the game might not accept that. 

Hmm, the user is in a situation where they can't open the cookbook, but they need to proceed. The next logical step is to try using the ingredients they have. So maybe the answer is to "use pork chop" or "cook pork chop". But the game might require the recipe. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to find a way to access the recipe through another method. Since the cookbook is in their inventory, maybe the answer is to "read cookbook" even if it's not allowed. But the game's previous response said it's not something you can open. 

Wait, maybe the user is supposed to look at the cookbook again. The previous action was "open cookbook", which didn't work. So the next action could be "look at cookbook". But the game might not accept that. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to use the knife to cut the pork chop. But the original goal is to cook a meal, so that might be a step towards it. 

But the user's main task is to check the cookbook for the recipe. Since they can't open it, maybe the game is expecting them to try another action, like "use cookbook" or "check cookbook". 

But the user has to follow the game's commands. The previous attempts were "open cookbook" and "pick up cookbook". Now, the next action is to try something else. Maybe the answer is to "look at cookbook" even if it's not allowed. But the game might not accept that. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to use the ingredients from the fridge and table to make a meal. For example, using the pork chop, onion, and pepper to make a dish. But without the recipe, it's unclear. 

In this case, the user is stuck because the cookbook isn't opening. The next step is to try using the ingredients they have. So the answer might be to "use pork chop" or "cook pork chop". But the game might require the recipe. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to find a way to open the cookbook. Since the previous attempt failed, maybe the answer is to "look at cookbook" or "examine cookbook". 

But the game's previous response said that the cookbook isn't something you can open. So the user might need to try another approach. 

In the end, the user's next action should be to try using the ingredients they have, even without the recipe. So the answer is to "use pork chop" or "cook pork chop". But the game might require the recipe. 

Alternatively, the user might need to find a way to access the recipe, so the answer is to "look at cookbook" again. 

But the user has to follow the game's commands. The previous action was "open cookbook", which didn't work. So the next action is to try "look at cookbook". But the game might not accept that. 

In this case, the user is in a loop. The correct action is to try using the ingredients they have. So the answer is to "use pork chop" or "cook pork chop".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal using the ingredients from the kitchen. They found the cookbook but couldn't open it. Then they tried using the pork chop, but that wasn't a valid command.

Hmm, maybe the correct action is to look at the cookbook again. Wait, the user already picked it up. Maybe they need to read it or find a way to use it. Since the cookbook is on the counter, perhaps they need to check the ingredients listed there. The fridge has some items, and the table has a knife. Maybe the next step is to check the cookbook's contents by looking at it again. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the knife to cut something. But the previous attempt to use the pork chop failed. Let me think about possible valid commands. The user might need to "read cookbook" or "check cookbook". But the game might require a different phrasing. Since the user tried "open cookbook" and it didn't work, maybe the correct action is to "look at cookbook" or "read cookbook". Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the knife on an ingredient. But the user's last action was "use pork chop", which was invalid. So perhaps the next step is to try a different command related to the cookbook or the ingredients. Let me check the possible actions again. The user is in the kitchen with a cookbook, fridge, oven, table, stove, etc. The goal is to cook a meal. Maybe the next step is to look at the cookbook again to find a recipe. So the correct command would be "look at cookbook" or "read cookbook". But the game might accept "read cookbook" as the command. Alternatively, maybe "check cookbook". Let me try that.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a kitchen game where they need to cook a meal. They've picked up the yellow apple and tried to dice it, but the game asked for a tool. The available items in the kitchen are a fridge with a pork chop, onion, and pepper; a closed oven; a massive table with a knife; a counter with a apple, potato, green apple, hot pepper, and cookbook; and a stove.

The user has the cookbook, which had a recipe that required dicing the yellow apple. The next step after dicing would be to fry it. But to dice the apple, they need a tool. The knife is on the table, so they should pick it up first. Then use the knife to dice the apple. After dicing, they can fry it using the stove. So the next action should be to pick up the knife.

Okay, let's see. The player is trying to follow the recipe from the cookbook. The current step is to dice the yellow apple. They picked up the knife, so the next logical step would be to use the knife to dice the apple. But in the game's context, the command might need to be more specific. The previous action was "dice yellow apple," but the game asked for the tool. Now that the knife is picked up, the next action should be to use the knife on the apple. So the correct command would be "dice yellow apple with knife" or something similar. But since the game might expect a simpler command, maybe just "dice yellow apple" again, assuming the knife is already in hand. Wait, the user just picked up the knife, so they need to use it. The game might require the command "dice yellow apple with knife." But looking at previous interactions, when the user tried "dice yellow apple," the game responded with a question about the tool. Now that the knife is picked up, the next step is to use it. So the correct command is "dice yellow apple with knife." But the user might need to specify the action as "use knife on yellow apple" or similar. However, based on the previous commands, the user used "dice yellow apple" and then "pick up knife." The next step is to actually perform the dicing action with the knife. So the correct command is "dice yellow apple with knife."

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the recipe from the cookbook. The current step is to "fry the yellow apple" after dicing it. But the system said "That's not a verb I recognise." So maybe "fry" isn't the correct command here.

Looking back at the recipe instructions: after dicing, the next step is to "fry the yellow apple." But in the game, the valid commands might be more specific. The user has the knife and the diced apple. Maybe they need to use the stove to fry it. The stove is in the kitchen, and the user hasn't used it yet.

Wait, the user previously tried "use pork chop" which wasn't valid. Then they tried "read cookbook," which worked. Now, after dicing the apple, the next step is to fry it. But "fry" might not be a direct command. Maybe the correct action is to "put the diced apple in the stove" or "fry the diced apple on the stove." Alternatively, the game might require using the stove's function.

Since the stove is empty, perhaps the user needs to place the diced apple there. The previous step was dicing, so now they need to transfer the diced apple to the stove. The correct command might be "put diced yellow apple in stove" or similar. But the game's accepted commands might be more straightforward. Let me check the available objects: there's a stove, a knife, a cookbook, etc. The user has the knife and the diced apple. So the next logical step is to use the stove to fry the apple. The correct command might be "fry diced yellow apple with stove" or "use stove to fry yellow apple." But since the system didn't accept "fry," maybe the correct action is to "put the diced apple in the stove" or "fry the apple on the stove." Alternatively, the game might require using the stove's action. Since the user has the knife, maybe they need to use it to fry, but the knife is already picked up. Hmm. The correct command here is probably "fry the diced yellow apple," but since that's not accepted, maybe "put diced yellow apple in stove." Let's try that.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the recipe from the cookbook. The current step is to fry the diced yellow apple. Earlier, they tried "fry yellow apple" but got an error. Then they tried putting the diced apple in the stove, but that didn't work either.

Hmm, maybe the correct action is to use the stove. The recipe says "fry the yellow apple," so perhaps they need to place the diced apple in the stove. But the user tried "put diced yellow apple in stove" and it didn't work. Maybe the stove needs to be turned on or there's another step.

Wait, the stove is empty. Maybe they need to put the apple in the stove first. Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "fry diced yellow apple" instead of "fry the yellow apple." But the user tried "fry yellow apple" and it didn't work. Maybe the game expects a specific verb or phrase.

Alternatively, maybe they need to use the stove's function. Since the stove is empty, perhaps the next step is to put the apple in the stove and then turn it on. But the user tried putting it in the stove and got an error. Maybe the correct action is to "put diced yellow apple in stove" but the game doesn't accept that. Or maybe the stove is a different object that needs to be interacted with.

Wait, the user has the knife and the diced apple. The next step in the recipe is to fry the apple. So maybe the correct action is to use the stove. Since the stove is empty, perhaps the user needs to put the apple in the stove and then fry it. But the previous attempt to put it in the stove failed. Maybe the correct command is "fry diced yellow apple" or "put diced yellow apple in stove." But the game didn't accept "put diced yellow apple in stove." Maybe the correct action is "fry diced yellow apple" even though the user tried "fry yellow apple" before.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the stove's function. Since the stove is empty, maybe the correct action is to "put diced yellow apple in stove" but the game doesn't recognize that. Or perhaps the correct action is to "turn on stove" first, then put the apple in. But the user hasn't done that yet.

Wait, the user's last action was "put diced yellow apple in stove" which failed. The game might expect a different command. Maybe "fry diced yellow apple" is the correct verb. Let me check the previous steps. The recipe says "dice the yellow apple, fry the yellow apple." So maybe the user needs to fry the diced apple. But the user tried "fry yellow apple" which didn't work. Maybe the correct command is "fry diced yellow apple." Let me try that.

Hmm, maybe the correct command is to use the stove. Since the stove is mentioned in the kitchen description, perhaps they need to interact with the stove first. The recipe says "fry the yellow apple," so maybe the action is to put the diced apple into the stove. But earlier, "put diced yellow apple in stove" was rejected because the stove can't contain things. Wait, maybe the stove is supposed to be used as a container or a tool. Alternatively, maybe the correct verb is "fry" but applied to the stove. Or perhaps the user needs to use the stove's function. Let me check the previous steps.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the recipe from the cookbook. The recipe says to dice the yellow apple, fry it, and then prepare the meal. So far, they've picked up the yellow apple, diced it, and tried to fry it. But the game is giving errors when they try to use "fry" as a verb.

Wait, maybe the correct action is to put the diced apple into the stove. But the user tried "put diced yellow apple in stove" and got an error. The game might expect a different phrasing. Maybe "put diced yellow apple in stove" is incorrect. Alternatively, maybe they need to use the stove's action. Like, "fry diced yellow apple" but that's not a valid verb. Or perhaps the correct command is to use the stove. Since the stove is empty, maybe they need to put the apple in the stove first, then use the stove to fry it.

But the user tried "put diced yellow apple in stove" and it said that can't contain things. Maybe the stove isn't a container. Maybe the correct action is to use the stove's function.

But the user's previous attempt was "fry diced yellow apple", which was invalid. So maybe the correct action is to use the stove. Let me check the game's possible commands. The user has a knife, the stove is empty. The correct step would be to put the diced apple into the stove, then use the stove to fry it. But the game might require a specific command.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the recipe from the cookbook. The recipe says to "dice the yellow apple," which they did using the knife. Then the next step is to "fry the yellow apple." But when they tried "fry yellow apple," the system said that's not a recognized verb. So they tried "put diced yellow apple in stove," but that didn't work either because the stove can't contain things.

Now, the user is at the step where they need to cook the diced apple. The system is asking, "What do you want to cook the yellow apple with?" So the next action should involve using an ingredient to cook the diced apple. The available ingredients in the kitchen include the raw pork chop and other items, but the recipe only mentions the yellow apple. However, since the user is in a cooking game, they might need to use a cooking method or tool.

Wait, the user has the knife and the diced apple. Maybe they need to use the stove. The stove is in the kitchen, but it's empty. The user might need to put the diced apple into the stove and then cook it. But the previous attempt to put it in the stove failed because the stove can't contain things. Maybe the correct action is to use the stove to cook the apple. Alternatively, maybe they need to use the pork chop as a cooking method, but that doesn't fit the recipe.

Looking back at the recipe: the directions are "dice the yellow apple, fry the yellow apple, prepare meal." So after dicing, the next step is to fry it. The user has the diced apple and the knife. The stove is the place to fry. Maybe the correct action is to "fry diced yellow apple," but the system didn't recognize that. Alternatively, maybe they need to use the stove's function. Since the stove is empty, perhaps the user needs to put the diced apple into the stove and then cook it. But the system said "That can't contain things," so maybe the stove isn't the right place. Wait, maybe the user needs to use the oven? But the oven is closed. Or maybe the user needs to use the stove's burner. Alternatively, maybe the correct action is to "cook diced yellow apple with [something]," but the system is asking what to cook it with. The user might need to use the pork chop as a cooking method, but that's not in the recipe. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the stove's heating element. Since the system is prompting for what to cook with, perhaps the user needs to use the stove as the cooking tool. So the next action would be to use the stove to cook the diced apple. But how to phrase that. The previous attempt was "fry diced yellow apple," which didn't work. Maybe the correct command is "cook diced yellow apple with stove." But the system might expect a different phrasing. Alternatively, since the user has the knife, maybe they need to use the knife to cook, but that's not standard. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to put the apple in the stove and then turn on the heat. But the system might not accept that. Given the previous errors, perhaps the correct action is to use the stove to cook the apple. So the next command should be "cook diced yellow apple with stove" or similar. But the system might require a different structure. Alternatively, since the user has the knife, maybe they need to use it to chop again, but that's already done. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the pork chop as an ingredient, but the recipe doesn't mention it. Hmm. The user is stuck here. The correct action based on the recipe is to fry the diced apple. The system is not recognizing "fry" as a verb here. Maybe the user needs to use the stove's function. So the next action is to "fry diced yellow apple" but the system says it's not recognized. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "put diced yellow apple in stove" but that failed. Maybe the correct action is to "use stove to fry diced yellow apple." But the system might not accept that. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "cook diced yellow apple" and the system is expecting a different command. Since the user is at the step where they need to cook, and the system is asking what to cook with, perhaps the correct answer is to use the stove. So the next action is "cook diced yellow apple with stove." But I need to check the previous commands. The user tried "fry diced yellow apple" which didn't work. Then "put diced yellow apple in stove" which failed. Now, the system is asking what to cook with. So the user needs to specify the cooking method. Maybe the correct action is "fry diced yellow apple with stove." But the system might not accept that. Alternatively, since the user has the knife, maybe they need to use it to cook, but that's not standard. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the pork chop as a cooking method.

Alternatively, since the user is at the step where they need to fry, maybe the correct action is "fry diced yellow apple" and the system's error is a mistake. But the user has to follow the system's rules. So the next action is to "fry diced yellow apple" even though it's not recognized. But the user has to make a choice. Based on the previous steps, the user has the diced apple and the knife. The next step is to fry it.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe in the cookbook. So far, they've picked up the cookbook, read the recipe, picked up the yellow apple, diced it with the knife, and fried it using the stove. The score has increased, so they're on the right track.

The recipe says to "dice the yellow apple, fry the yellow apple, prepare meal." They've done the first two steps. Now, the next step is "prepare meal." But in the game, the user has to use the right commands. The last action was frying the apple, and now they need to move to the final step. 

The user might need to "prepare meal" or maybe "serve meal." But the game might require a specific command. Since the previous action was frying, maybe the next step is to serve or eat the meal. However, the original goal is to enjoy the meal, so maybe the final action is to eat it. But the game's commands might be limited. Let me check the previous interactions. 

The user tried "fry diced yellow apple" which wasn't recognized, then "cook diced yellow apple with stove" which worked. Now, after frying, the next step is probably to "prepare meal" or "eat meal." Since the recipe says "prepare meal," maybe that's the next command. Alternatively, since the user is supposed to enjoy the meal, maybe "eat meal" is the correct action. 

But the game's responses might require exact commands. The user has to follow the recipe steps. The recipe's third step is "prepare meal," so the next action should be that. However, in the game, the user might need to use the correct verb. Let me think of possible commands. Maybe "prepare meal" is the right next step. Alternatively, since the user has already fried the apple, maybe they need to "serve meal" or "eat meal." 

Looking back, after frying the apple, the user's score is 3, and the next step is to prepare the meal. The correct command here would be "prepare meal" to complete the recipe and achieve the goal of enjoying the meal.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe in the cookbook. So far, they've gathered the yellow apple, diced it, fried it using the stove, and prepared the meal. The recipe had three steps: dice the apple, fry it, and prepare the meal. They've completed all three steps, right? The score went up each time they did an action correctly.

Now, the next step would be to enjoy the meal. The original goal was to cook a delicious meal, so after preparing it, the logical next action is to eat it. But the game might have a specific command for that. The user has the meal in their inventory, so they need to consume it. The possible command could be "eat meal" or "consume meal". Since the game uses "prepare meal" earlier, maybe "eat meal" is the correct verb here. Let me check the previous actions. The last action was "prepare meal", which added the meal to inventory. Now, the next step is to eat it. So the correct command should be "eat meal".
