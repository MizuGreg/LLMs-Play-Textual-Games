You've just sauntered into a kitchen. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."

You can see a fridge. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a raw pork chop and a red onion. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. You see a closed oven, which looks conventional, in the corner. Were you looking for a table? Because look over there, it's a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a yellow apple, a raw yellow potato, a green apple, a green hot pepper and a cookbook. You can see a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

Okay, let's see. The user is in a kitchen game where they need to cook a meal. The cookbook recipe says to dice a yellow apple, fry it, and prepare the meal. So far, they've looked at the cookbook and opened it, but it wasn't possible to open initially. Now, they need to follow the recipe.

First, check the ingredients. The yellow apple is on the counter. The recipe says to dice it, so the next step is probably to take the apple. Then, fry it. But the stove is empty, so maybe they need to put the apple on the stove. Wait, but the directions say "fry the yellow apple," so maybe after dicing, they need to fry it. But the user has to interact with the objects. 

The user's previous action was looking at the cookbook. Now, the next logical step is to take the yellow apple from the counter. Then, dice it. But the game might require specific commands. The user has to take the apple first. So the next action should be "take yellow apple" to get it. Then, dice it. But the user hasn't taken the apple yet. So the correct next step is to take the apple. Then, proceed to dice it. But the user's current location is the kitchen, and the apple is on the counter. So the command should be "take yellow apple".

Okay, the user has taken the yellow apple from the counter. The next step according to the recipe is to dice the apple. So the next action should be to dice the yellow apple. But in the game, the command might be "dice yellow apple". Let me check the previous steps. The recipe says "dice the yellow apple", so the user needs to perform that action. Since the apple is already taken, the next command is to dice it. Then, after dicing, they need to fry it. But the user has to follow the directions step by step. So the next action is to dice the apple.

Okay, the user is trying to dice the yellow apple but needs to know what to use for dicing. In a kitchen, you typically use a knife. The game has a knife on the table. So the next step is to take the knife. Once the knife is taken, the user can use it to dice the apple. The previous action was dice yellow apple, but the game asked for the tool. So the correct next action is to take the knife.

Wait, the user is at the kitchen, and the knife is on the table. So the command should be "take knife". Then, use the knife to dice the apple. But the game might require the knife to be taken first. So the next action is to take the knife.

Okay, the user has taken the knife. Now they need to dice the yellow apple using the knife. The previous step was trying to dice the apple but needing the knife. Now that the knife is taken, the next action should be to dice the apple with the knife. So the command would be "dice yellow apple with knife". But maybe the game expects a different phrasing. Alternatively, after taking the knife, the user can directly dice the apple. The correct command here is likely "dice yellow apple".

Okay, the user tried to type "fry yellow apple" but the game said that's not a recognized verb. So I need to figure out the correct command for frying. In the recipe, the direction is "fry the yellow apple". Maybe the correct command is "fry yellow apple" but the game doesn't accept it. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the stove. Since the stove is in the kitchen and empty, perhaps the action is to put the diced apple into the stove. But the game might expect a specific verb. Maybe "fry" is allowed but the previous attempt was wrong. Wait, the user's last action was "dice yellow apple", which worked. Now, the next step is to fry it. The game might require the command "fry yellow apple" but the user might need to use the stove. Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "put yellow apple in stove" or "fry apple". But the recipe says "fry the yellow apple", so the correct command is likely "fry yellow apple". The game might have a typo or the user's previous input was incorrect. Let me check the previous interactions. The user tried "fry yellow apple" and got an error. Maybe the correct command is "fry apple" without specifying yellow. Or maybe the user needs to use the stove first. But the stove is empty. Alternatively, the game might accept "fry yellow apple" but the user's input was formatted wrong. Since the user's last action was "dice yellow apple", the next step is to fry it. So the correct command is "fry yellow apple".

Okay, the user is having trouble getting the game to recognize the "fry" command. Let me think about possible issues. The recipe says "fry the yellow apple", but the game might expect a different phrasing. Maybe the correct verb is "cook" instead of "fry"? Or perhaps the user needs to use the stove first. The stove is in the kitchen, so maybe the action is "put yellow apple in stove" or "use stove to fry apple". Alternatively, the game might require the user to use the word "fry" with the object, like "fry yellow apple". But the user tried that and got an error. Maybe the game expects "heat" or "cook" as the verb. Let me check previous interactions. The user tried "fry yellow apple" and it didn't work. Maybe the correct command is "cook yellow apple". Alternatively, the user might need to use the stove. Since the stove is empty, perhaps the action is "put yellow apple on stove" and then "fry". But the game might not accept that. Alternatively, the user might need to use the word "fry" with the stove. Maybe "fry apple with stove". But the game might not recognize that. Since the user is stuck, maybe the correct action is to use "cook" instead of "fry". Let me try that. The recipe says "fry", but maybe the game uses "cook" as the verb.

Let me check the available objects. The stove is in the kitchen, and the user has the yellow apple. So the next step is to place the apple on the stove.

Okay, the user is trying to cook the yellow apple but the game is asking what they want to cook it with. Earlier, they put the apple on the stove, took it off, and now they need to cook it. The stove is probably the cooking appliance here. Since the stove is in the kitchen and the user has the apple, the next step is to use the stove to cook the apple. The correct command would be "cook yellow apple with stove" or simply "cook yellow apple". But the game might expect the word "stove" to be included. However, the user previously tried "cook yellow apple" and it didn't work. Wait, in the previous interaction, when they tried "cook yellow apple", the game said they need to take the apple first. But now they have the apple. So maybe the correct command is "cook yellow apple with stove". Alternatively, since the stove is the tool, the command is "use stove to cook yellow apple". But the game might accept "cook yellow apple" if the stove is the default. Let me check the previous steps. The user put the apple on the stove, took it off, and now needs to cook it.

Okay, the user tried to type "You fried the yellow apple." but the game says that's not a verb. Wait, maybe the user is confused between the game's commands and the actual action. The correct command should be "fry yellow apple" or "cook yellow apple". But earlier, the game didn't recognize "fry" but accepted "cook". However, in the last step, the user's action was "cook yellow apple with stove", which resulted in the apple being fried. But the game's response was "That's not a verb I recognise." Maybe the user needs to use a different command. Let me check the previous interactions. The user tried "fry yellow apple" and it didn't work, then tried "cook yellow apple" and it worked. But the game's response was confusing. Maybe the correct command is "fry" without specifying the object. Alternatively, the game might require the user to use the stove as the tool. The correct next action after cooking is to finish the meal. Since the recipe was followed, the user might have completed the meal. The original goal was to cook a meal, so the user might have succeeded. The game might be indicating that the user has finished, so the next action is to enjoy the meal. But the user needs to follow the commands. Since the last action was successful, the game might have ended. But the user is still in the kitchen. Maybe the correct command is "finish meal" or "eat meal". However, the game might not have that command. Alternatively, the user has already completed the recipe, so the game ends. The user's final action was "cook yellow apple with stove", which worked, so the meal is prepared. The game might now end, but the user is prompted again. Maybe the correct next action is to "eat the meal" or "finish". But the game might not recognize that. Alternatively, the user has already completed the goal, so the game ends. The user's last action was successful, so the answer is that the meal is ready.
