You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Pantry =-
You are in a pantry. A typical kind of place. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

You can see a shelf. The shelf is wooden. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

There is an open plain door leading west.

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. An ordinary one. You can barely contain your excitement.

Hey, want to see a fridge? Look over there, a fridge. The fridge contains a white onion, a raw white tuna and a yellow onion. You can see a closed conventional looking oven here. You make out a table. Now why would someone leave that there? On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. On the counter you see a red apple, a red hot pepper, a green apple and a yellow apple. You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.

There is an open plain door leading east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.
