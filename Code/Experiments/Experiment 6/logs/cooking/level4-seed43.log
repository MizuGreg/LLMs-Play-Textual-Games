-= Corridor =-
You arrive in a corridor. A typical kind of place. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.

-= Bedroom =-
You find yourself in a bedroom. A standard kind of place.

You can make out a bed. The bed is large. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm. Oh well

You need an exit without a door? You should try going east. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door.
