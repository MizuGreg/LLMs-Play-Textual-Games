You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Livingroom =-
You find yourself in a livingroom. A typical kind of place. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You can make out a sofa. The sofa is comfy. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

There is an exit to the north. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.

-= Corridor =-
You arrive in a corridor. An ordinary one.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door. There is an exit to the west.

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. A typical kind of place.

You see a fridge. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. The fridge contains a raw white tuna, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a raw pork chop, a block of cheese, a carrot, a red bell pepper, a white onion, a raw red tuna and a lettuce. You see a closed oven, which looks conventional, close by. You see a table. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You scan the room for a counter, and you find a counter. You see a red hot pepper, a raw red potato, a tomato, a raw yellow potato, a yellow apple, a red onion, a green hot pepper, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well

There is an open frosted-glass door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. A typical kind of place.

You see a fridge. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. The fridge contains a raw white tuna, a yellow bell pepper, a raw pork chop, a block of cheese, a carrot, a red bell pepper, a white onion, a raw red tuna and a lettuce. You see a closed oven, which looks conventional, close by. You see a table. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You scan the room for a counter, and you find a counter. You see a red hot pepper, a raw red potato, a tomato, a raw yellow potato, a yellow apple, a red onion, a green hot pepper, a raw purple potato and a cookbook on the counter. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well

There is an open frosted-glass door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

You find yourself in a livingroom. A typical kind of place. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You can make out a sofa. The sofa is comfy. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

There is an exit to the north. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.
