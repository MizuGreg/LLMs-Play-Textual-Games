You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a fridge, so there's that. The fridge contains a block of cheese and a white onion. You see a closed oven nearby. You scan the room for a table, and you find a table. But there isn't a thing on it. You smell a hideous smell, and follow it to a counter. You see a green hot pepper, a green bell pepper, an orange bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a red hot pepper, a banana, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You can make out a stove. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a stove, go to TextWorld. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is an open frosted-glass door leading east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door. There is an exit to the south.
