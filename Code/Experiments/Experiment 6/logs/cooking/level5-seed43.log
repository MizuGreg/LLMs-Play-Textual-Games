You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Bedroom =-
You arrive in a bedroom. A typical one. You begin looking for stuff.

You scan the room for a bed, and you find a bed. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.

GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Livingroom =-
You find yourself in a livingroom. A standard one.



You need an exit without a door? You should try going east. There is an exit to the north.

go east
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. An usual one. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You make out an opened fridge nearby. The fridge contains a raw pork chop, a block of cheese, a red onion, a carrot, a raw white tuna, a white onion and a raw red tuna. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see an oven. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. You smell an intriguing smell, and follow it to a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. You see a tomato and a green hot pepper on the counter. You see a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is an open plain door leading east. You need an exit without a door? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. An usual one. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You make out an opened fridge nearby. The fridge contains a raw pork chop, a block of cheese, a red onion, a carrot, a raw white tuna, a white onion and a raw red tuna. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see an oven. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a knife. You smell an intriguing smell, and follow it to a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. You see a tomato and a green hot pepper on the counter. You see a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is an open plain door leading east. You need an exit without a door? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. An usual one. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You make out an opened fridge nearby. The fridge is empty! What a waste of a day! As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see an oven. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You make out a table. The table is massive. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. You smell an intriguing smell, and follow it to a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. You see a tomato and a green hot pepper on the counter. You see a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is an open plain door leading east. You need an exit without a door? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.
