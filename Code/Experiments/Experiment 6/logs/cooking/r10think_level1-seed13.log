You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.

You see an opened fridge, which looks conventional, nearby. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper. You make out a closed oven right there by you. Look over there! a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Look over there! a counter. You see a raw yellow potato, a yellow apple, a raw red potato, a banana, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty. You move on, clearly depressed by your TextWorld experience.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal in the kitchen. They found the cookbook and put it in the oven. Now they're trying to heat the oven. The problem is that the system keeps saying "heat oven" is not a recognized verb. The user tried "preheat oven" but that also didn't work.

Hmm, maybe the correct command is just "heat oven" but the system is rejecting it. Wait, maybe the oven needs to be preheated first. But the user already tried "preheat oven" and it didn't work. Alternatively, maybe the correct verb is "turn on" or "activate" the oven. But the user hasn't tried that.

Looking back at the previous steps: the user took the cookbook, put it in the oven, and now is trying to heat it. The game might expect a different command. Maybe "open oven" was done already, so now it's about heating. But since "heat" isn't working, perhaps the correct action is to "preheat" but the system doesn't recognize that. Alternatively, maybe the oven is already preheated, and the user needs to proceed to cook.

Wait, the original goal is to cook a meal. The user has the cookbook, which is in the oven. Maybe the next step is to close the oven, then open it again to take out the cooked meal. But the user hasn't closed it yet. Alternatively, maybe the oven is already ready, and the user needs to take the cookbook out and use it to cook.

But the user is stuck on heating the oven. Since the system isn't recognizing "heat" or "preheat", maybe the correct command is simply "heat" without the "preheat". But the user tried that. Alternatively, maybe the oven is already heated, and the user should proceed to take the cookbook out. But the user needs to heat it first.

Alternatively, maybe the correct action is to "close the oven" after putting the cookbook in, then "heat". But the user hasn't closed it yet. Wait, the user put the cookbook in the oven, but maybe the oven needs to be closed first. So the steps could be: put cookbook in oven, close oven, then heat.

But the user hasn't closed the oven. So maybe the next step is to close the oven. Let me check the previous interactions. The user opened the oven, put the cookbook in, but didn't close it. So maybe the oven is open, and the user needs to close it first. Then heat it. But the system doesn't recognize "heat" as a verb. So maybe the correct command is "close oven" then "heat oven".

But the user is trying to heat it now. Since the system isn't recognizing "heat", maybe the correct verb is "activate" or "turn on". But the user hasn't tried that. Alternatively, maybe the oven is already on, and the user needs to proceed.

Alternatively, maybe the user should take the cookbook out of the oven and use it to cook. But that doesn't make sense. The cookbook is the recipe, so maybe the user needs to follow the steps in the cookbook. But the user is in the oven.

Wait, the original goal is to cook a meal. The user has the cookbook in the oven. Maybe the next step is to close the oven, then open it again to take out the cooked meal. But the user needs to heat the oven first. However, the system isn't recognizing the verbs. So maybe the correct action is to "close oven" then "heat oven".

But the user is at the step where they tried "heat oven" multiple times. Since the system isn't recognizing it, maybe the correct action is to "close oven" first. Let me think. The user put the cookbook in the oven, but the oven is open. So closing it would be the next step. Then, after closing, maybe the oven is ready to be heated. But the system might not accept "heat" as a verb. Alternatively, maybe the oven is already heated, and the user can proceed.

Alternatively, maybe the user should take the cookbook out of the oven and use it to cook. But that's not clear. The user needs to follow the recipe. Since the cookbook is in the oven, maybe the oven is used to cook the meal. But the user hasn't added any ingredients yet. The user has the ingredients on the counter: potato, apple, banana, etc. Maybe the user needs to take those and put them in the oven with the cookbook.

But the user hasn't done that yet. So the steps would be: take ingredients, put them in the oven, then heat. But the user is trying to heat the oven now. So perhaps the correct action is to "heat oven" even though the system says it's not recognized. But the user is stuck. Maybe the correct command is "preheat oven" but the system doesn't recognize it. Alternatively, maybe the correct verb is "turn on" the oven.

But the user has tried "heat" and "preheat" multiple times. Since the system is not recognizing those, maybe the correct action is to "close oven" first. Then, after closing, maybe the oven is ready to be heated. So the next step is to close the oven, then heat it. But the user hasn't closed it yet.

So the next action should be "close oven" to proceed. Then, after closing, maybe the oven is ready to be heated. But the user is at the step where they tried to heat it. So maybe the correct action is to close the oven first.

<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out what's going on here. The user is trying to cook a meal in the kitchen. They've taken the cookbook from the counter, put it in the oven, closed the oven, but now they're stuck because the system isn't recognizing "heat oven" or "preheat oven" as valid commands.

First, I need to recall the previous steps. The user opened the oven, put the cookbook inside, closed it, and now is trying to heat it. The problem is that the system is rejecting the verbs "heat" and "preheat". Maybe the correct command is different. Let me think about possible verbs related to ovens. Common commands might be "turn on", "activate", "start", or "open". But the user already opened the oven earlier.

Wait, maybe the oven needs to be preheated, but the correct verb is "preheat". However, the system says that's not recognized. Alternatively, maybe the oven is already preheated, and the user just needs to put the ingredients in. But the user hasn't added any ingredients yet. The cookbook is in the oven, but maybe the recipe requires other items.

Looking back, the user has the following items on the counter: raw yellow potato, yellow apple, raw red potato, banana, cookbook, and a knife. The user hasn't used the knife yet. Maybe the recipe requires chopping the vegetables, but the user hasn't done that. However, the user is focused on the oven.

Alternatively, maybe the oven is already ready, and the user should take the cookbook out and use it to cook. But the user is trying to heat the oven. Since the system isn't recognizing the verbs, perhaps the correct action is to "open the oven" again to take the cookbook out. But the user closed it earlier.

Wait, the user closed the oven, so maybe they need to open it again to take the cookbook out. But the original goal is to cook a meal, so maybe the user needs to follow the recipe steps. The cookbook is in the oven, but maybe the oven is for baking, and the user needs to put the ingredients in. However, the user hasn't added any ingredients yet.

Alternatively, maybe the user should take the ingredients from the counter and put them in the oven with the cookbook. But the user hasn't done that. The user is stuck on heating the oven, which isn't working. Since the system isn't recognizing the verbs, maybe the correct command is to "close the oven" again, but that's already been done.

Hmm, maybe the user should try a different approach. Since the system is not accepting "heat" or "preheat", perhaps the correct command is "start oven" or "activate oven". But the user hasn't tried that. Alternatively, maybe the oven is already on, and the user needs to proceed to take the cookbook out.

But the user's goal is to cook a meal, so maybe the next step is to take the cookbook out of the oven and use it to cook. However, the user needs to open the oven first. So the next action should be "open oven" again to take the cookbook out. But the user already did that earlier. Wait, the user closed the oven after putting the cookbook in. So opening it again would allow them to take the cookbook out.

But the user is trying to heat the oven, which is not working. Maybe the correct action is to open the oven, take the cookbook out, and then proceed to cook. But the user is stuck on heating. Since the system isn't recognizing the verbs, maybe the correct action is to "open oven" again to proceed.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, the user is trying to follow a recipe from the cookbook. They've taken the cookbook, opened it, and started with the first recipe. The recipe requires dicing a yellow potato. The user has the knife, so they tried to cut the potato with the knife. But the system keeps saying it only understood up to wanting to cut the potato.

Hmm, maybe the command format is wrong. The user tried "cut yellow potato with knife", but maybe it should be "cut the yellow potato with the knife" or "dice the yellow potato with the knife". The system might be expecting a different phrasing. Alternatively, maybe the action is just "dice yellow potato" since the knife is already taken. But the user had to take the knife first, which they did.

Wait, the user is at step 11, and the system is still not recognizing the cut command. Maybe the correct action is to use the knife on the potato without specifying "cut" but "dice". Or perhaps the system needs the object to be specified as "the yellow potato". Let me check the previous steps. The user has the yellow potato and the knife. The recipe says "dice the yellow potato". So maybe the correct command is "dice the yellow potato with the knife" or "dice yellow potato".

But the user tried "cut yellow potato with knife" multiple times, and the system isn't accepting it. Maybe the system expects "dice" instead of "cut". The recipe says "dice", so maybe the correct command is "dice yellow potato". Let me try that. Alternatively, since the user has the knife, maybe the action is "cut yellow potato with knife", but the system is not recognizing it. Maybe the system needs the object to be specified as "the yellow potato" instead of just "yellow potato".

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to first "hold" the potato and then "cut" it. But the user hasn't done that. The user is at the step where they have the knife and the potato. The next step is to perform the action. Since the system is not recognizing the command, maybe the correct action is to "dice the yellow potato" without mentioning the knife, assuming the knife is already in hand. Let me try that.

Okay, the user is trying to follow the recipe from the cookbook. They've diced the yellow potato, but now they need to fry it. The problem is that the system isn't recognizing commands like "fry yellow potato with pan" or "fry yellow potato in pan". 

Looking back, the user has the knife and the yellow potato. They diced the potato, so the next step is to cook it. The recipe says "fry the yellow potato". But the system isn't accepting "fry" as a verb here. Maybe the correct command is to use the pan. The user has a pan? Wait, in the initial description, the user saw a stove, but didn't mention a pan. However, in the kitchen, there's a counter with ingredients, but no mention of a pan. Maybe the user needs to use the stove instead of a pan.

Alternatively, maybe the correct verb is "cook" instead of "fry". Or "heat" the pan. But the user tried "heat oven" earlier, which didn't work. Maybe the user needs to "heat the pan" or "put the potato in the pan". But the system isn't recognizing those commands. 

Wait, the user is at step 15, and the score is -2. The previous steps show that the user took the knife, diced the potato, but can't fry it. The system might expect a different action. Maybe the user needs to "put the diced potato in the pan" or "place the potato in the pan". But the user hasn't taken the pan yet. 

Alternatively, maybe the stove is the correct tool. The user saw a stove in the kitchen. So maybe the correct action is to "fry the potato on the stove". But the system isn't recognizing "fry" as a verb. Maybe the correct command is "cook the potato on the stove". Or "heat the stove". 

But the user is stuck on the frying step. Since the system isn't recognizing "fry", maybe the correct action is to "cook the yellow potato" without specifying the method. Or "put the potato in the stove". But the stove is a conventional appliance, so maybe the user needs to "heat the stove" first. 

Alternatively, the user might need to "use the pan" or "use the stove" to cook the potato. But the user hasn't taken the pan. The initial description didn't mention a pan, so maybe the stove is the right tool. The user has the knife and the potato. The next step is to cook it. Since the system isn't recognizing "fry", maybe the correct command is "cook yellow potato with stove". But the system might expect "heat stove" first. 

Alternatively, maybe the user should "put the potato in the stove" or "place the potato on the stove". But the stove is a surface, so maybe "put the potato on the stove". However, the system might not recognize that. 

Given the previous failures, the user might need to try a different verb. Maybe "heat the potato" or "cook the potato". But the recipe says "fry", so perhaps the correct action is to "fry the yellow potato" even if the system doesn't recognize it. But the user has tried that multiple times. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "use the stove" to cook the potato. So the next action is "use stove to fry potato". But the system might not recognize that. 

In the end, the user is stuck on the frying step. The correct action might be to "fry yellow potato with stove" or "cook yellow potato on stove". But since the system isn't recognizing "fry", maybe the user should try "cook yellow potato" or "heat stove". However, the user's previous attempts show that "heat oven" didn't work, but the stove is a different appliance. 

The user needs to proceed with the recipe. The next step after dicing is frying. Since the system isn't recognizing "fry", maybe the correct command is "cook yellow potato" or "put potato in stove". But the user has to use the correct verbs. Given the previous failures, maybe the correct action is to "cook yellow potato" even if it's not perfect.

Okay, the user is trying to fry the yellow potato but keeps getting errors. Let me think about the possible commands. The user has the stove in the kitchen. Maybe the correct verb is "heat" instead of "fry". Or "cook" with the stove. The system didn't recognize "fry with stove", so maybe "heat stove" first. Alternatively, "put potato on stove". But the user needs to follow the recipe. The recipe says "fry the yellow potato". Since "fry" isn't working, maybe "cook" is the correct verb. Let me try "cook yellow potato with stove".
