You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Livingroom =-
I am stoked to announce that you are now in the livingroom.

If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a sofa. You wonder idly who left that here. But the thing is empty. Hopefully, this discovery doesn't ruin your TextWorld experience!

You need an exit without a door? You should try going north.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Corridor and Bathroom. Every time they go west, they end up in the Bathroom, and going east leads back to the Corridor. The original goal was to cook a meal by checking the cookbook in the kitchen. But the user has been moving around without finding the kitchen.

The user's current position is the Corridor (again). The possible exits are north, south, east (sliding door), and west. But going west loops back to the Bathroom. The sliding door east might be a dead end or lead to another area. The north and south exits are mentioned as not having doors, so maybe they're open.

But the user hasn't found the kitchen yet. The initial instruction was to check the cookbook in the kitchen. So maybe the kitchen is in a different part of the map. The user has been moving through corridors and bathrooms, but not towards the kitchen. Perhaps the correct path is to go north from the Corridor, but the user hasn't tried that yet. Alternatively, maybe the sliding door east leads to the kitchen.

Wait, the user has been going west and east repeatedly, but maybe they need to find a different path. Let me check the previous steps. The user started in the Livingroom, then Bedroom, Corridor, Bathroom, and back. The kitchen hasn't been mentioned yet. The original goal is to check the cookbook in the kitchen. So the user needs to find the kitchen.

Looking at the Corridor description again: "There is a closed sliding patio door leading east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west."

So the exits are north, south, and west (which loops to bathroom). The east door is closed. Maybe the user needs to open the sliding door east. But the user hasn't tried that yet. The previous actions were going west, east, etc., but maybe the correct path is to go north from the Corridor. However, the user hasn't tried that yet. Alternatively, maybe the kitchen is accessible through the north exit from the Corridor.

But the user's last action was going west again, leading back to the bathroom. The user might be stuck in a loop. The correct action would be to try opening the sliding door east or going north/south. However, the user hasn't tried opening the door. But the game's previous responses didn't mention any action to open the door. Maybe the door is a puzzle element. But the user's instructions are to move, so perhaps the correct path is to go north from the Corridor.

Alternatively, maybe the kitchen is in the north direction. The user needs to go north from the Corridor. But the user's previous steps were going west and east, so maybe they need to try north. However, the user's last action was going west again. The user might need to try going north from the Corridor to reach the kitchen.

But the user hasn't tried that yet. So the next action should be to go north. But the user's previous steps were going west, so maybe they need to break the loop and try a different direction. The correct action here is to go north from the Corridor.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Corridor and Bathroom. They keep going west and east, which isn't helping. The original goal was to find the cookbook in the kitchen. So far, they haven't reached the kitchen. The Corridor has a sliding door east, but it's closed. Maybe they need to open it. But the game hasn't provided a way to open it yet. Alternatively, maybe the kitchen is accessible through the north or south exits from the Corridor. The user hasn't tried going north or south yet. The previous attempts were focused on west and east, which loop back. The correct path might be to go north from the Corridor. But the user's last action was going west again. They need to break the loop and try a different direction. The next action should be to go north to check if that leads to the kitchen.

Of every kitchen you could have sauntered into, you had to walk into an ordinary one.

Were you looking for a fridge? Because look over there, it's a fridge. You can see an oven. You can make out a table. You see a cookbook on the table. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You smell an intriguing smell, and follow it to a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You make out a stove! But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

There is a closed frosted-glass door leading west. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door.

Okay, the user has followed the recipe in the cookbook. The recipe requires pork chop, red onion, white tuna. But when they tried to take those items, they couldn't find them. However, they found raw purple and yellow potatoes on the counter. Maybe the recipe is using the potatoes instead of the mentioned items. The user took both potatoes. Now, they need to use these potatoes to make the meal. The next step would be to dice the potatoes, grill them, and prepare the meal as per the recipe. Since the cookbook was used, the next action should be to follow the directions. The user has the potatoes, so they should proceed with dicing and cooking. The correct command would be to dice the purple potato and yellow potato. But the game might require specific commands. The user already took the potatoes, so the next step is to dice them. The command would be "dice raw purple potato" and "dice raw yellow potato". But the user needs to input one command at a time. The next action should be to dice the purple potato.

Okay, the user is trying to dice the purple potato but keeps getting errors. The previous attempts to use the knife on the potato resulted in "That's not a verb I recognise." Maybe the correct command is to use the knife on the potato. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to first pick up the knife. But the user hasn't taken the knife yet. Wait, in the kitchen, the user saw a knife on the counter. So maybe the user needs to take the knife first. Let me check the previous steps. The user took the purple and yellow potatoes but didn't take the knife. So the next step should be to take the knife, then use it on the potato. But the user is currently trying to dice the potato without the knife. So the correct action is to take the knife first. Therefore, the next command should be "take knife".

Okay, the user is trying to cut the purple potato with the knife but keeps getting the same response. The game seems to not understand the command. Maybe the correct command is different. Let me think about the possible commands. The user has the knife and the potato. The recipe says to dice the potato. Maybe the correct command is "dice raw purple potato" without specifying the knife. But earlier, that didn't work. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the knife on the potato. The correct command might be "use knife on raw purple potato". But the user tried that before. Wait, the user took the knife, so maybe the command is "cut raw purple potato with knife". But the game keeps saying it only understood up to cutting. Maybe the game expects a different verb, like "slice" or "chop". Alternatively, maybe the user needs to just "cut" the potato. Let me try "cut raw purple potato" again. If that doesn't work, maybe "slice" or "chop". But the user has to guess the correct command. Since the previous attempts with "cut" didn't work, maybe the correct command is "dice raw purple potato" but the game doesn't recognize it. Alternatively, the user might need to use the knife first. But the user already took the knife. Hmm. The correct answer might be to try "cut raw purple potato" again, even though it's been tried. Or maybe the game expects "use knife to dice raw purple potato". But the user has to try different variations. Since the user is stuck, the next action should be to try "cut raw purple potato" again.

You need to specify how you want to cut the purple potato. Either slice, dice, or chop it.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, the user is trying to cook the diced potatoes but keeps getting errors when using verbs like grill, roast, or chop. The recipe says to "grill the pork chop, dice the red onion, roast the red onion, dice the white tuna, grill the white tuna, prepare meal." But the user has the potatoes instead. Maybe the correct action is to use the stove. The user has a stove in the kitchen. So the next step is to use the stove to cook the diced potatoes. The correct command might be "put diced purple potato on stove" or "cook diced purple potato on stove". Alternatively, since the recipe mentions grilling and roasting, maybe the user needs to use the stove's functions. The correct command could be "grill diced purple potato on stove" but the game might expect a different command. Since the user is stuck, the next action should be to try using the stove to cook the potatoes.
