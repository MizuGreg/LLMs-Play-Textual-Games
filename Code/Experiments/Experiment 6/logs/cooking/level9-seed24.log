-= Backyard =-
You've entered a backyard.

You see a patio table. The patio table is stylish. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a patio chair. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a patio chair? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? What's that over there? It looks like it's a BBQ.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is a closed wooden door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going north.

-= Backyard =-
You've entered a backyard.

You see a patio table. The patio table is stylish. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a patio chair. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a patio chair? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? What's that over there? It looks like it's a BBQ.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is a closed wooden door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going north.
