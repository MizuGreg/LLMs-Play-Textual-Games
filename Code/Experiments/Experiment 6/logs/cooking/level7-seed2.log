You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Pantry =-
Well, here we are in the pantry. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You can make out a shelf. The shelf is wooden. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is a closed plain door leading south.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in the pantry, and the goal is to find a recipe in the kitchen to cook a meal. The pantry has a shelf that's empty and a door south. The user has tried looking in all directions (north, south, east, west, up, down) but found nothing. The shelf was closed but couldn't be opened. Now, after looking around again, the user is stuck.

Hmm, maybe the key is the closed shelf. The user tried to open it but was told it's not possible. Wait, maybe there's another way to interact with the shelf. Or perhaps the door south leads to another room where the cookbook is. But the user hasn't checked that yet. The original instruction said to check the cookbook in the kitchen. So maybe the kitchen is through the south door. The user has been looking around the pantry but hasn't checked the south door. Maybe the door is the way to go. Let me check the previous steps. The user tried looking north, south, east, west, up, down, and around. The south door was mentioned as closed. Wait, the initial description said there's a closed plain door leading south. So maybe the user needs to go through that door to the kitchen. But the user hasn't tried that yet. The last action was looking around, which didn't find anything. So the next logical step is to go south through the door. Let me confirm: the user is in the pantry, and the south door is closed. So the next action should be to go south, which might lead to the kitchen where the cookbook is. Therefore, the correct command is "go south".

You have to open the plain door first.

<think>
Okay, the user is trying to open the south door in the pantry, but the system is responding that it only understood the command as wanting to open the plain door. The user has been repeatedly trying to open the door, but it's not working. Maybe the door isn't just a regular door; perhaps it's a plain door that requires a specific action to open. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to find a key or use another item to open it. But in the pantry, the only things mentioned are the empty shelf and the door. Since the shelf is empty, maybe there's no key there. The user might need to look for another way to open the door, like using a tool or finding a different method. However, the user has already checked all directions and found nothing. Maybe the door is locked, and the user needs to find a way to pick it or use a specific command. But the system hasn't provided any clues about that. The original goal is to find the cookbook in the kitchen. So perhaps the user needs to figure out how to open the door, maybe by using the correct command format. The previous attempts were "open door south," but the system didn't accept it. Maybe the correct command is "open south door" or "open the door south." Alternatively, maybe the door is already open, and the user just needs to move through it. But the system says the door is closed. The user is stuck, so the next step might be to try a different command, like "use key" if there's a key available, but there's no mention of a key. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to look for a way to bypass the door. But given the information, the only possible action is to try opening the door again, perhaps with a different phrasing. However, the system keeps rejecting it. Maybe the user needs to find another way to proceed, like looking for the cookbook in the pantry even though the shelf is empty. But the cookbook is supposed to be in the kitchen. So the user needs to open the door to the kitchen. The correct command might be "go south" instead of trying to open the door. But the system says the door is closed. So the user has to open it first. Maybe the correct command is "open door south" but the system is having trouble parsing it. Alternatively, maybe the door is a plain door that can be opened by default. The user might need to try "go south" without opening the door. But the system says the door is closed. This is confusing. The user needs to find a way to proceed, so the next action is to try opening the door again, perhaps with a different command structure.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, the user is stuck in the pantry trying to open the south door. They've tried "open door south" multiple times, but the system keeps saying it only understood the command as wanting to open the plain door. Maybe the correct command is just "open door" without specifying south, but the door is closed. Alternatively, maybe the door is a plain door that can be opened by default. The user needs to find a way to proceed to the kitchen where the cookbook is. Since the shelf is empty, the key must be elsewhere. Maybe the user needs to look for a key in the pantry, but there's nothing there. The next step is to try opening the door again, perhaps with a different command. The system might be expecting "open door" instead of "open door south". Let me try that.

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. A standard kind of place. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."

Hey, want to see a fridge? Look over there, a fridge! You see a closed oven nearby. You see a table. On the table you see a knife. You scan the room for a counter, and you find a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a green hot pepper, a green bell pepper, a red bell pepper, a red hot pepper, a green apple and a cookbook. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty.

There is an open plain door leading north. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door. There is an exit to the south.

Okay, the user is in the kitchen and has been trying to look around but hasn't found anything. The kitchen has a fridge, oven, table with ingredients, a cookbook, and a stove. The user needs to find the cookbook to cook a meal. They've been looking in all directions but maybe missed the cookbook. The cookbook is on the counter, so the user needs to pick it up. The previous actions were looking in all directions, so the next step is to check the counter where the cookbook is. The command should be "take cookbook" to pick it up and then proceed to cook.

You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, the user is in the kitchen and has the cookbook. The goal is to cook a meal using the recipe from the cookbook. The user tried to cook a meal but got an error. The cookbook is on the counter, so maybe they need to read the recipe first. The correct steps would be to open the cookbook, check the recipe, gather ingredients, and then cook. Since the user has the cookbook, the next action should be to open it to get the recipe. Then, use the ingredients from the counter to make the meal. But the user might need to follow the recipe steps. The previous attempt to cook directly failed, so the right approach is to first examine the cookbook. So the next command should be "open cookbook" to access the recipe.
