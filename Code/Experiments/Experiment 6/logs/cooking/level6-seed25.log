You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Bedroom =-
You've entered a bedroom.

You can see a bed. However, the bed, like an empty bed, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.

-= Livingroom =-
Well, here we are in a livingroom.

As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a sofa. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the sofa.

You need an exit without a door? You should try going east. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.

-= Kitchen =-
Look around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

An open conventional looking fridge is right there by you. The fridge contains a red onion, a white onion, a yellow onion, a red hot pepper, a raw white tuna, a raw yellow potato, a block of cheese, a raw pork chop and a red bell pepper. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. Is this it? Is this what you came to TextWorld to see? an oven? You can see a table. But there isn't a thing on it. You can see a counter. On the counter you can see a cookbook and a knife. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. Oh, great. Here's a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is an open frosted-glass door leading south. There is an exit to the west.
