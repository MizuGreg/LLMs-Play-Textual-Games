You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You've entered a kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a fridge. The fridge contains a block of cheese, a red onion, a red hot pepper and a white onion. You see a closed oven in the corner. You can make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook, so there's that. Hey, want to see a counter? Look over there, a counter. On the counter you can see a raw yellow potato and a knife. You make out a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty.
