Ah, the bedroom. This is some kind of bedroom, really great standard vibes in this place, a wonderful standard atmosphere. And now, well, you're in it.

You can see a bed. The bed is large. But the thing is empty. You move on, clearly upset with your TextWorld experience.

There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

Ah, the bedroom. This is some kind of bedroom, really great standard vibes in this place, a wonderful standard atmosphere. And now, well, you're in it.

You can see a bed. The bed is large. But the thing is empty. You move on, clearly upset with your TextWorld experience.

There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

You are in a livingroom. An ordinary kind of place.

As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a sofa. What a great pairing of adjectives and nouns! The sofa is comfy. The sofa appears to be empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the sofa! oh well.
