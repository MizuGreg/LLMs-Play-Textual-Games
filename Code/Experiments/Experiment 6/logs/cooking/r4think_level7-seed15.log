You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Livingroom =-
You find yourself in a livingroom. A typical kind of place. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You can make out a sofa. The sofa is comfy. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

There is an exit to the north. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.

You find yourself in a kitchen. A typical kind of place.

You see a fridge. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a closed oven, which looks conventional, close by. You see a table. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You scan the room for a counter, and you find a counter. You see a red hot pepper, a raw red potato, a tomato, a raw yellow potato, a yellow apple, a red onion, a green hot pepper, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well

There is a closed frosted-glass door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the cookbook in the kitchen. So far, they've navigated through the living room, corridor, and back to the living room, then into the kitchen. Now they're in the kitchen, which has all the ingredients listed: red hot pepper, raw red potato, tomato, raw yellow potato, yellow apple, red onion, green hot pepper, raw purple potato, cookbook, and a knife. There's also a fridge, oven, stove, and counter.

The user's goal is to find the recipe in the cookbook and cook a meal. The next step would be to check the cookbook. Since the user is in the kitchen, they need to pick up the cookbook. But the prompt says they can see the cookbook on the counter. So the action should be to take the cookbook. Once they have it, they can look through the recipes to find something to cook. The ingredients are all there, so maybe they can follow the recipe step by step. The user hasn't picked up the cookbook yet, so the next action should be to take it. Then, after that, they can proceed to cook using the ingredients available.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal using the ingredients in the kitchen. They've already taken the red hot pepper and the raw red potato. The goal is to follow the cookbook recipe. Since they took the first two items, the next logical step would be to take another ingredient mentioned in the cookbook. The cookbook is on the counter, but they already took it. Wait, no, the user took the cookbook but couldn't open it. Maybe they need to find the recipe steps. Alternatively, they might need to collect more ingredients. The available ingredients include tomato, yellow apple, red onion, green hot pepper, etc. Maybe the next step is to take the tomato or another ingredient needed for the recipe. Alternatively, they might need to use the knife to prepare the ingredients. But the user hasn't used the knife yet. However, the previous actions were taking ingredients, so maybe continuing to collect ingredients is the way to go. The next ingredient could be the tomato or the red onion. Let's check the available items again. The counter has red hot pepper, raw red potato, tomato, raw yellow potato, yellow apple, red onion, green hot pepper, raw purple potato, cookbook, and a knife. So the user has taken red hot pepper and raw red potato. Next, maybe take the tomato. So the next action would be take tomato.

Okay, the user is trying to cook a meal in the kitchen. They've collected several ingredients like the red hot pepper, raw red potato, tomato, red onion, green hot pepper, and a knife. The problem is that they can't seem to use the knife to cut the potato. The previous attempt to "cut red potato with knife" didn't work. The system responded that it didn't understand the command. So, maybe the correct way to use the knife is different. In many text adventures, you might need to use the knife on the potato directly. So instead of saying "cut red potato with knife," maybe the correct command is "cut potato with knife" or "use knife on potato." Alternatively, the knife might need to be used on the potato to chop it. Let me check the available actions. The user has the knife and the potato. The correct command might be "cut potato with knife" or "chop potato with knife." Since the system didn't recognize "cut red potato with knife," maybe specifying the potato without "red" would work. Let's try that.

Okay, the user has been chopping various ingredients and roasting the potatoes. Now they need to cook the other items like the green hot pepper, red onion, and tomato. Since the oven is closed, they might need to open it first. Alternatively, they could use the stove, but it's conventional and has nothing on it. The next step is probably to open the oven, then cook the remaining ingredients. Let me check the previous steps. The user has the chopped green hot pepper, red onion, and tomato. So the next action should be to open the oven, then cook those items. But the oven is closed, so first, they need to open it. The command would be "open oven" or "open closed oven". Then, after opening, they can cook the remaining ingredients.

<think>
Okay, the user is trying to cook a meal in the kitchen. They've roasted several ingredients like the red potato, yellow potato, green hot pepper, red onion, and tomato. Now, they're at the kitchen again after opening the oven. The previous action was "cook chopped tomato in oven," which resulted in "You roasted the tomato." But the system responded that "That's not a verb I recognise." Wait, maybe the correct command is "roast chopped tomato in oven" instead of "cook." Since the user has already roasted the tomato, maybe they need to check if all ingredients are cooked. The goal was to follow the cookbook recipe, so perhaps they need to check if they have all the ingredients ready. The user might need to check the oven or confirm if the meal is complete. Alternatively, they might need to use the stove instead of the oven. But the stove is conventional and has nothing on it. The next step could be to check the oven's contents or confirm the meal is ready. However, the system might expect a specific command. Since the user has already roasted all ingredients, maybe the next action is to "check oven" or "open oven again." But the oven is already open. Alternatively, the user might need to "serve meal" or "eat meal," but the goal was to cook, not eat. The correct action might be to "check if meal is ready" or "confirm cooking." But the system might not recognize those commands. The user should probably check the oven again or try a different verb like "roast" instead of "cook." But the previous roast commands worked. Maybe the system is expecting "serve" or "eat," but the original goal was to cook. So the final step is to confirm the meal is ready, and the next action is to "serve meal" or "eat meal," but the system might not recognize those. Alternatively, the user might need to "check cookbook" again, but they already have it. The correct answer is probably to "check oven" or "confirm meal," but the system might not recognize those. The user should try "check oven" as the next action.

Okay, the user is trying to cook a meal in the kitchen. They've been roasting various ingredients, but accidentally burned the tomato. Now, they need to fix this. The previous attempts to cook the tomato in the oven resulted in burning it. Since the oven is already open, maybe they should try a different approach. Perhaps using the stove instead of the oven? The stove is conventional but has nothing on it. Alternatively, they might need to adjust the cooking method. Since the tomato was burned, maybe they should try cooking it again with a different technique. But the system only allows specific commands. The user has the knife and other ingredients. Maybe they need to "put tomato on stove" or "cook tomato on stove." But the stove is empty. Alternatively, they might need to "check oven" again. However, the oven is already open. The correct action might be to "put tomato on stove" or "cook tomato on stove," but the system might not recognize those. The user should try a different verb or command. Since "cook" didn't work, maybe "roast" again, but that burned it. Perhaps "serve" or "eat," but the goal is to cook. The next step is to try a different command, maybe "put tomato on stove" or "stove tomato." But the system might not recognize that. The user needs to find the correct command to proceed.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop where every time they try to cook the tomato on the stove, it burns. They've tried taking the tomato from the stove and putting it back, but it's not working. The oven was previously used for roasting, but that also led to burning. Maybe the issue is that the stove isn't the right place for the tomato. The user has already roasted other items successfully, so maybe the tomato is a special case. Alternatively, perhaps they need to use a different cooking method or adjust the time. But the game's commands are limited, so the user has to use the allowed verbs. The previous successful actions were "roast chopped potato in oven" and "roast chopped green hot pepper in oven." Maybe the tomato should be roasted again but with a different approach. However, the user already tried that and it burned. Maybe the correct action is to "check oven" again or "open oven" to ensure it's properly prepared. Alternatively, they might need to "serve meal" even if it's burned, but the goal is to cook, not eat. The user needs to find a command that works, so perhaps "check oven" or "confirm meal" is the next step. But the system might not recognize those. The correct answer is likely to try a different verb or command, but given the options, "check oven" might be the best bet.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop where every time they try to roast the tomato in the oven, it's not working. They've tried multiple commands like "roast tomato in oven" but the system doesn't recognize it. The previous successful actions were roasting other items, so maybe the issue is with the tomato specifically. The user might need to use a different verb or command. Since "roast" isn't working, maybe "cook" or "bake" is the correct verb. Alternatively, they might need to "put tomato in oven" or "place tomato in oven." The system might expect a different phrasing. The user has already tried "roast" and "cook," so perhaps the correct command is "put tomato in oven." Let me check the previous interactions. The user tried "roast chopped tomato in oven" which was invalid. Maybe the correct command is "put tomato in oven" without the "roast" part. The system might recognize "put" as the verb.
