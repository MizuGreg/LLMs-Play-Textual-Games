You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You've entered a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a green bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a lettuce, a green apple, a red hot pepper and a yellow onion. You see an oven. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You can make out a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a yellow apple and a red apple. You see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.
