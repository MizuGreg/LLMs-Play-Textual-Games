-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. A typical kind of place.

You can make out a fridge. The fridge contains a red bell pepper, a block of cheese, a raw red tuna and a green bell pepper. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just an oven. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You scan the room, seeing a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. Wow! Just like in the movies! Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a yellow apple, a raw yellow potato, a red apple and a knife. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.

There is an open plain door leading north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door.

Okay, so you're in a pantry, cool, but is it ordinary? You better believe it is.

Look over there! a shelf. The shelf is wooden. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open plain door leading south.

You find yourself in a kitchen. A typical kind of place.

You can make out a fridge. The fridge is empty! What a waste of a day! Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just an oven. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You scan the room, seeing a table. The table is massive. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You swear loudly. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. But the thing is empty. You see a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.

There is an open plain door leading north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door.

You find yourself in a kitchen. A typical kind of place.

You can make out a fridge. The fridge is empty! What a waste of a day! Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just an oven. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You scan the room, seeing a table. The table is massive. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You swear loudly. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. But the thing is empty. You see a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.

There is an open plain door leading north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door.

Look over there! a shelf. The shelf is wooden. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open plain door leading south.

You find yourself in a kitchen. A typical kind of place.

You can make out a fridge. The fridge is empty! What a waste of a day! Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just an oven. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You scan the room, seeing a table. The table is massive. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You swear loudly. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. But the thing is empty. You see a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.

There is an open plain door leading north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door.

-= Pantry =-
Okay, so you're in a pantry, cool, but is it ordinary? You better believe it is.

Look over there! a shelf. The shelf is wooden. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open plain door leading south.
