You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Bedroom =-
You've just shown up in a bedroom. The room is well lit.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a bed. The bed is large. The bed appears to be empty.

There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.

-= Corridor =-
You're not going to believe this, but you've just entered a corridor.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one. There is an exit to the south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

-= Bathroom =-
You are in a bathroom. An usual kind of place.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a toilet. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The toilet is white. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is an exit to the south.

-= Kitchen =-
Well, here we are in the kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You make out an opened fridge. The fridge contains a green bell pepper, a block of cheese, a raw red tuna, a yellow onion, a green hot pepper, a red bell pepper, a red apple, a raw white tuna and a red onion. You see a closed oven, which looks conventional, nearby. You see a table. On the table you see a knife. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You see a counter. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a counter? On the counter you can see a raw purple potato, a green apple, a yellow apple and a cookbook. You make out a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is an open plain door leading west. There is an exit to the east.
