-= Bathroom =-
You've just shown up in a bathroom.

As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a toilet. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. What's the point of an empty toilet?

You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.

I never took you for the sort of person who would show up in a corridor, but I guess I was wrong.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You need an exit without a door? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. You begin looking for stuff.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a fridge. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a raw pork chop and a red onion. You make out an oven. You see a table. You see a knife on the table. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a yellow apple, a raw yellow potato, a green apple, a green hot pepper and a cookbook. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. Oh, great. Here's a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is an open frosted-glass door leading east. There is an exit to the south. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is in a TextWorld game where they need to cook a meal using a recipe from the cookbook. The recipe requires dice the yellow apple, fry it, and prepare the meal. So far, the user has tried to cut the yellow apple with the knife, but the system keeps responding that it only understood the command up to wanting to cut the apple. Maybe the issue is that the command format is incorrect.

Looking at the previous interactions, the user tried "cut yellow apple with knife" multiple times, but the system didn't acknowledge the action. The correct command might be "cut the yellow apple with the knife" instead of "cut yellow apple with knife". The game might require the use of "the" and proper object references. 

Alternatively, maybe the game expects a different verb or structure. For example, "dice the yellow apple" is part of the recipe, so perhaps after cutting, the next step is to fry it. But the user hasn't successfully cut the apple yet. The system's response indicates that the action wasn't recognized, so the command needs to be adjusted to match the game's expected syntax.

The user is close to the goal, but the main issue is correctly executing the cut action. Once the apple is diced, the next step would be to fry it. So the next action should be to cut the apple correctly, then fry it. But since the previous attempts failed, the user needs to adjust the command format. The correct command might be "cut the yellow apple with the knife" to ensure the game understands the action.

Okay, the user is stuck on cutting the yellow apple with the knife. They've tried multiple times, but the game keeps saying it only understood up to wanting to cut the apple. Maybe the command format is wrong. Let me check the previous interactions.

The user tried "cut yellow apple with knife" and "cut the yellow apple with the knife". The game didn't accept it. Maybe the game expects a different structure, like "cut the yellow apple using the knife" or "dice the yellow apple with the knife". The recipe says "dice the yellow apple", so perhaps "dice" is the correct verb here instead of "cut". 

Alternatively, maybe the knife isn't properly retrieved. The user took the knife from the table, so that's done. The next step is to use it. Maybe the game needs the command to be "dice the yellow apple with the knife" instead of "cut". Let me try that. If that doesn't work, maybe "fry the diced apple" after cutting. But the user hasn't successfully cut it yet. So the main issue is the correct command for cutting/dicing. Let's try using "dice" as per the recipe's instruction.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to fry the yellow apple. The previous attempts to use "fry" didn't work. The game might expect a different verb or a specific phrase. The recipe says "fry the yellow apple," but maybe the correct command is "cook the yellow apple on the stove" or "heat the yellow apple in the stove." Alternatively, maybe "fry the diced yellow apple" is the right thing. Since the user already diced the apple, perhaps the next step is to use the stove. The stove is conventional, so maybe "put the diced apple in the stove" or "place the apple in the stove." Alternatively, "fry the apple using the stove." But the game might need a specific command like "fry the yellow apple on the stove." Wait, the user tried "fry the yellow apple on the stove" and it didn't work. Maybe the correct verb is "cook" instead of "fry." Or maybe "heat" the apple. Alternatively, the game might require using the stove's action, like "use the stove to fry the apple." But the user has to follow the recipe's directions. The recipe says "fry the yellow apple," so maybe the correct command is "fry the yellow apple with the stove." But the system said that's not a verb. Hmm. Maybe the correct command is "cook the yellow apple in the stove." Or "place the apple in the stove and fry it." But the user can only input one command. Since the previous attempts failed, maybe the correct command is "fry the yellow apple on the stove." But the system didn't recognize it. Maybe the game expects "fry the apple" without specifying the stove. Wait, the user already has the knife and the apple. Maybe the next step is to use the stove. The stove is in the kitchen. So the command could be "put the diced apple in the stove" or "fry the apple in the stove." Alternatively, "heat the apple in the stove." But the recipe says "fry," so maybe "fry the apple" is the correct command, and the stove is implied. But the user tried that and it didn't work. Maybe the game requires "fry the yellow apple" without the stove. Or maybe the stove is already in use. I'm a bit stuck. The user needs to follow the recipe's directions. The next step after dicing is to fry. So the correct command is probably "fry the yellow apple," but the game isn't recognizing it. Maybe the user needs to use the stove. So the command could be "fry the yellow apple with the stove." But the system said that's not a verb. Maybe the correct command is "cook the yellow apple on the stove." Alternatively, "heat the yellow apple in the stove." But the recipe says "fry," so maybe the user should try "fry the yellow apple" again, even though it didn't work before. Alternatively, maybe the game expects "fry the apple" without the yellow part. But the recipe specifies the yellow apple. So the correct command is "fry the yellow apple." But the system says it's not a verb. Maybe the user needs to use the stove's action. So the command is "use the stove to fry the yellow apple." But the user can only input one command. The previous attempts didn't work, so maybe the correct answer is "fry the yellow apple" even though it didn't work. Or maybe the user needs to use the stove. So the next command is "fry the yellow apple on the stove." But the system didn't recognize it. Maybe the correct command is "fry the apple" without the yellow. But the recipe says yellow. I'm not sure. The user is close, but the game isn't accepting the commands. Maybe the correct answer is "fry the yellow apple" again, even though it didn't work before. Alternatively, the user needs to use the stove. So the next command is "fry the yellow apple on the stove." But the system says that's not a verb. Maybe the correct command is "cook the yellow apple on the stove." I'll try that.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, the user is trying to "prepare the meal" but the game isn't recognizing the command. Let me think about the recipe again. The recipe says "dice the yellow apple, fry the yellow apple, prepare meal." The user has already diced and fried the apple. The next step is "prepare meal," but the game isn't accepting "prepare the meal with the yellow apple" or similar commands.

Maybe the game expects a different verb for the final step. Instead of "prepare," perhaps "serve" or "eat" the meal. But the recipe says "prepare meal," so maybe the correct command is "prepare the meal" without specifying the apple. Alternatively, since the apple is already cooked, maybe the meal is considered prepared once it's fried. But the game requires a specific command.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the oven. The kitchen has an oven mentioned. The recipe doesn't specify using the oven, but maybe that's where the meal is prepared. However, the recipe says to fry, so the stove is the right place. 

Wait, the user has already fried the apple. Maybe the "prepare meal" step is just confirming that the meal is ready. But the game isn't recognizing the command. Maybe the correct command is "serve the meal" or "eat the meal." But the original recipe says "prepare meal," so perhaps the user needs to use that exact phrase. However, the game's previous responses indicate that it's not recognizing "prepare the meal with the yellow apple." 

Alternatively, maybe the meal is considered prepared once the apple is fried, so the user just needs to say "prepare the meal" without the apple. But the game might require the apple to be mentioned. Since the user is stuck, maybe the correct action is to use the oven. Let me check the kitchen description again. The oven is mentioned, but the recipe says to fry. Maybe the user needs to use the oven's action. But the recipe says to fry, so the stove is correct. 

Alternatively, maybe the game expects the user to just say "prepare meal" without the apple. But the previous attempts to use "prepare the meal with the yellow apple" didn't work. Maybe the correct command is "prepare the meal" alone. Let me try that.
