-= Kitchen =-
This might come as a shock to you, but you've just stumbled into a kitchen.

You can see a fridge. The fridge contains a block of cheese and a white onion. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven, so there's that. You can see a table. The table is massive. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You scan the room for a counter, and you find a counter. On the counter you make out a green hot pepper, a green bell pepper, an orange bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a red hot pepper, a banana, a cookbook and a knife. You can see a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.
