Guess what, you are in a place we're calling a backyard.

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a patio chair. The patio chair is stylish. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You scan the room for a patio table, and you find a patio table. The patio table appears to be empty. You can see a BBQ.

There is a closed screen door leading north. There is an open barn door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

Guess what, you are in a place we're calling a backyard.

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a patio chair. The patio chair is stylish. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You scan the room for a patio table, and you find a patio table. The patio table appears to be empty. You can see a BBQ.

There is a closed screen door leading north. There is an open barn door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one.
