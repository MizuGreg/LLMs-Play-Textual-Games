You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. A typical kind of place. You begin looking for stuff.

What's that over there? It looks like it's a fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop. You see an oven. You scan the room, seeing a table. On the table you make out a cookbook. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a tomato, a raw red potato and a knife. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You smell a sickening smell, and follow it to a stove. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.
