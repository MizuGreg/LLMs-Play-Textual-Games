You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. A normal one. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You see a closed fridge. You can see a closed oven, which looks conventional, right there by you. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a knife. Hey, want to see a counter? Look over there, a counter. You see a banana and a cookbook on the counter. You can see a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is a closed frosted-glass door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one.
