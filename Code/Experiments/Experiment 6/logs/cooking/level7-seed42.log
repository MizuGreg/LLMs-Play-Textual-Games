You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Corridor =-
You arrive in a corridor. A normal one. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.



You need an exit without a door? You should try going south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.

-= Bedroom =-
You find yourself in a bedroom. A typical kind of place. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

You can see a bed. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

There is an exit to the east. There is an exit to the west.

-= Livingroom =-
Well how about that, you are in a place we're calling a livingroom. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You can make out a sofa. The sofa is comfy. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. This always happens!

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one. There is an exit to the west.

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. A typical kind of place.

You see a fridge. A closed oven is close by. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a table. You see a knife on the table. Wow! Just like in the movies! You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a raw yellow potato, a green apple and a cookbook. You make out a stove. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a stove, go to TextWorld. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove! oh well.

There is a closed frosted-glass door leading south. There is an exit to the east.

Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You make out a stove. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a stove, go to TextWorld. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove! oh well.

There is an open frosted-glass door leading south. There is an exit to the east.

You've just shown up in a pantry. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You can make out a shelf. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter. The counter is vast. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

Well how about that, you are in a place we're calling a livingroom. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one. There is an exit to the west.

-= Pantry =-
You've just shown up in a pantry. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You can make out a shelf. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

There is an open frosted-glass door leading north.

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. A typical kind of place.

You see a fridge. A closed oven is close by. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a table. You see a knife on the table. Wow! Just like in the movies! You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter. The counter is vast. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You make out a stove. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a stove, go to TextWorld. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove! oh well.

There is an open frosted-glass door leading south. There is an exit to the east.
