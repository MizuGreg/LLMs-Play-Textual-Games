If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open frosted-glass door leading west. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is in a text-based game where they need to cook a meal using the cookbook found in the kitchen. So far, they've navigated through the living room, corridor, and arrived at the kitchen. They took the cookbook from the counter and tried to open the frosted-glass door west, but the system is having trouble understanding the command.

First, I need to recall the game's objectives. The user needs to check the cookbook for a recipe, then cook a meal. The current location is the kitchen, where they have the cookbook. The fridge has ingredients like raw tuna, onion, pork chop, and there's an oven, stove, and a table. The door west leads to another area, but the user might need to use the ingredients from the fridge to make a dish.

The user tried to open the frosted-glass door west, but the system didn't recognize it. Maybe the correct command is just "open west" or "open door west". Alternatively, maybe the door is already open, and the user needs to proceed inside. However, the game's previous messages mention that there's an exit to the south, so perhaps the west door leads to another room, but the user needs to focus on cooking instead.

Since the user has the cookbook, they should look for a recipe. The ingredients in the fridge are raw tuna, onion, and pork chop. Maybe the recipe requires these. The oven and stove are available for cooking. The user might need to use the knife from the counter to prepare the ingredients. But the user hasn't used the knife yet.

The user's next action should be to check the cookbook for a recipe. Since they have the cookbook, they need to read it. However, in text games, sometimes you have to use commands like "read cookbook" or "look at cookbook". But in the previous steps, the user just took the cookbook, so maybe the next step is to open it. However, the system might require a specific command.

Alternatively, the user might need to use the ingredients from the fridge. For example, take the raw tuna, onion, and pork chop, then use the stove or oven to cook them. The user might need to follow the recipe steps from the cookbook.

But the user is stuck trying to open the door. The system might have a typo or misunderstanding. The correct command might be "open west" instead of "open frosted-glass door west". The user tried that twice, and the system didn't recognize it. Maybe the door is already open, and the user should proceed inside, but the game's message says there's an exit to the south. Alternatively, the west door might lead to a different area, but the user's goal is to cook, so maybe they should focus on using the ingredients in the kitchen.

Considering the original goal is to cook a meal, the user should probably use the ingredients from the fridge, take them to the stove or oven, and cook them. The cookbook would have the recipe steps. So the next action should be to take the ingredients, then use the stove or oven. But the user hasn't taken any ingredients yet. So the next step is to take the raw tuna, onion, and pork chop from the fridge.

But the user is in the kitchen, and the fridge is there. The command would be "take raw white tuna from fridge", "take white onion from fridge", etc. Then, using the stove or oven to cook them. The cookbook would have the recipe, so maybe the user needs to look at the cookbook to find the steps.

But the user's last action was trying to open the door, which the system didn't recognize. The user might need to try a different command for the door. Alternatively, maybe the door is already open, and the user should proceed to the next room, but the game's message says there's an exit to the south. However, the user's goal is to cook, so maybe they should focus on that.

In the current state, the user has the cookbook and the ingredients in the fridge. The next logical step is to take the ingredients and start cooking. So the user should take the raw tuna, onion, and pork chop from the fridge, then use the stove or oven to cook them. The cookbook would have the recipe, so the user needs to read it. But in the game, the command might be "read cookbook" or "look at cookbook".

But the user's previous action was taking the cookbook, so maybe the next step is to read it. However, the system might require the user to use the "look at" command. Alternatively, the user might need to use the ingredients from the fridge. So the next action should be to take the ingredients, then cook them.

But the user is stuck on the door. The system might have a problem with the command. The correct command is "open west" or "open door west". The user tried "open frosted-glass door west" twice, but the system didn't recognize it. Maybe the correct command is just "open west".

So, the user should try "open west" again. If that doesn't work, maybe the door is already open, and the user should proceed. However, the user's goal is to cook, so maybe they should focus on that. But the game's message says there's an exit to the south, so maybe the user can go back to the living room, but that's not helpful.

Alternatively, the user might need to use the stove. The stove is in the kitchen, so the user can use it. The ingredients are in the fridge, so the user needs to take them. So the next action is to take the raw tuna, onion, and pork chop from the fridge. Then, use the stove to cook them. The cookbook would have the recipe steps.

So, the user's next action should be to take the ingredients. The correct command would be "take raw white tuna from fridge", "take white onion from fridge", etc. But the user might not have the correct syntax. Alternatively, the user can just take the ingredients from the fridge.

But the user is in the kitchen, and the fridge is there. So the next step is to take the ingredients. The user has the cookbook, so they can refer to it for the recipe. Therefore, the next action is to take the ingredients from the fridge.

Okay, the user is trying to cook a meal in a text-based game. They've navigated to the kitchen, taken the cookbook, and now have the ingredients from the fridge: raw white tuna, white onion, and raw pork chop. The next step is to use the stove to cook these ingredients.

The user tried "use stove" but got an error. The system might expect a different command. Maybe "cook" is the correct verb instead of "use". Alternatively, "heat" or "light" the stove. Since the stove is a cooking appliance, the correct action might be to "cook" the ingredients on the stove. Let me check the previous steps. The user has the ingredients, so the next logical step is to cook them. The correct command is likely "cook" followed by the ingredient, but since the user has multiple ingredients, maybe just "cook" without specifying. However, the system might require a specific command. Alternatively, "start cooking" or "light stove". But the user has already taken the ingredients, so the next step is to use the stove to cook them. The correct command is probably "cook" or "use stove". Since "use stove" didn't work, maybe "cook" is the right verb. So the next action is "cook".

Okay, the user is trying to cook a meal in the kitchen. They've taken the ingredients: tuna, onion, and pork chop. The previous attempts to cook failed because the system didn't recognize the commands. The user tried "cook tuna with onion" but got an error. Now, they need to use the stove, but "use stove" isn't working.

Wait, maybe the correct command is "light stove" or "turn on stove" to heat it. Once the stove is lit, they can cook the ingredients. Alternatively, maybe "heat" is the verb. The user needs to first light the stove, then place the ingredients on it. Since the system didn't accept "use stove", perhaps "light" is the right action. Let me try that.

Okay, the user is stuck in the kitchen trying to cook. They have the ingredients but can't get the stove to work. The previous attempts to "light stove" or "heat stove" didn't work. Maybe the correct command is "turn on stove" or "activate stove". Alternatively, maybe the stove is already on, and they need to use it. Since the system is not recognizing "light" or "heat", perhaps the correct verb is "use" again. Wait, earlier "use stove" was rejected. Maybe "start stove"? Or "ignite"? The user needs to find the right command. Since the system is strict, maybe "use" is the correct verb, but the user tried it before. Alternatively, maybe the stove is a noun, so the command is "cook on stove". But the user has to use the correct verbs. The system might expect "light" but it's not working. Maybe the user should try "turn on stove" or "switch on stove". Alternatively, maybe the stove is already lit, and the user needs to proceed to cook. But the system says "Cooking requires a source of heat." So the stove needs to be lit. Maybe the correct command is "light" even though it says "dangerous act". The user has to try again. So the next action is "light stove".

Okay, the user is trying to cook in the kitchen but keeps getting errors when trying to use the stove. They've tried "light stove" and "heat stove", but both are rejected. The system says "This dangerous act would achieve little" for "light stove" and "That's not a verb I recognise" for "heat stove". The user needs to find the correct command to activate the stove.

Maybe the correct verb is "turn on" or "switch on" the stove. Alternatively, since the stove is a noun, perhaps the command is "use stove" again, even though it was rejected before. Or maybe the system expects "ignite" instead of "light". Alternatively, the user might need to "cook" the ingredients directly without specifying the stove, but the system says cooking requires a heat source. 

Since the user has already taken the ingredients and the stove is in the kitchen, the next step is to use the stove. The correct command might be "use stove" even if it was rejected before. Alternatively, the system might require "heat" as a verb. But the user tried "heat stove" and it didn't work. Maybe the correct command is "light" again, even though it's rejected. The user has to keep trying different verbs. The next possible command could be "turn on stove" or "switch on stove". Let's try "turn on stove".

Okay, the user is stuck in the kitchen trying to cook. They've tried multiple commands like "light stove", "heat stove", "turn on stove", but none work. The system keeps rejecting them. The user has the ingredients: tuna, onion, and pork chop. The goal is to cook a meal using the cookbook.

Maybe the correct command is "cook" without specifying the stove. But the system says cooking requires a heat source. Alternatively, maybe the stove is already on, and the user needs to place the ingredients on it. The user might need to use the "put" command to place the ingredients on the stove. For example, "put tuna on stove" or "put onion on stove". Since the user has the ingredients, maybe they need to cook them one by one. The previous error was using multiple objects with "cook", so maybe cook each ingredient separately. The next step is to try putting the tuna on the stove. The correct command would be "put tuna on stove". Let's try that.

Okay, the user is trying to cook the white tuna. They put it on the stove, but the system says they need to take it first. Wait, maybe the user didn't actually take the tuna from the fridge yet. Earlier, they took the raw white tuna from the fridge, but maybe it's still in the fridge. The command "put tuna on stove" might not work if the tuna is still in the fridge. So the correct steps would be: take the tuna from the fridge, then put it on the stove. But the user already took the tuna. Wait, the system says "You need to take the white tuna first." Maybe the user didn't take it yet. Let me check the previous steps. The user took the raw white tuna from the fridge, so it should be in their inventory. But maybe the game requires them to pick it up again. So the next action is to take the white tuna from the fridge again. But they already did that. Alternatively, maybe the command is "take white tuna from fridge" again. But the user already has it. Hmm, maybe the system is confused. The correct action is to use the stove with the tuna. Since the user put it on the stove, maybe they need to cook it. But the system says they need to take it first. Maybe the user needs to take it from the stove. Wait, the user put it on the stove, so it's on the stove. The system might be expecting "cook" again. But the user tried "cook white tuna" and got an error. The correct command might be "cook" without specifying, but the system says to take it first. This is confusing. The user needs to take the tuna from the stove, but that doesn't make sense. Maybe the correct action is to "cook" the tuna on the stove. But the system says to take it first. I'm stuck. The user has the tuna, put it on the stove, but needs to take it first. Maybe the command is "take white tuna from stove" but that's not right. Alternatively, the user needs to "cook" it again. The system might have a bug, but the user has to follow the commands. The next action is to cook the white tuna.

Okay, the user is trying to cook a meal in the kitchen. They've taken the ingredients: white tuna, onion, and pork chop. They tried cooking the tuna but needed to take it from the stove. Now, the system is asking what to cook the white tuna with. The user tried using onion and pork chop, but the system says they can't see any such thing. Maybe the ingredients are still in the fridge or not properly retrieved. The user needs to make sure all ingredients are in their inventory. They took the tuna from the fridge, but maybe the onion and pork chop are still in the fridge. So the next step is to take the onion and pork chop from the fridge. Then, use them to cook the tuna. The correct commands would be "take onion from fridge" and "take pork chop from fridge" before trying to cook. But the user already took the tuna. Wait, the user has the tuna, onion, and pork chop. Maybe the system is expecting to use the stove again. The previous error was about using multiple objects. So the user should cook the tuna with the onion and pork chop on the stove. The correct command is "cook white tuna with onion and pork chop on stove". But the system might not accept that. Alternatively, cook each ingredient separately. The user needs to follow the correct syntax. The next action is to cook the white tuna with the available ingredients.

Okay, the user is trying to cook the white tuna with onion and pork chop on the stove. The system keeps rejecting the command because it can't use multiple objects. The user has already tried "cook white tuna with onion and pork chop on stove" and got an error. The previous attempt was "cook white tuna with onion on stove", which worked for the tuna and onion but not with the pork chop.

The user needs to find a way to cook all three ingredients. Since the system doesn't allow multiple objects, maybe they need to cook them one at a time. First, cook the tuna with the onion, then use the pork chop separately. But the system might require a specific command structure. Alternatively, maybe the pork chop is already on the stove, and the user needs to add the tuna and onion. But the user has to follow the correct verbs.

The correct approach is to cook each ingredient individually. So first, cook the white tuna with the onion on the stove. Then, cook the pork chop on the stove. The user should try these steps separately. The next action is to cook the pork chop on the stove.

<think>
Okay, the user is stuck trying to cook the white tuna with the onion. The system keeps rejecting the command, even though they've tried it multiple times. The user has already cooked the pork chop, but the tuna and onion are still uncooked. The system might be expecting a different verb or structure. Maybe the correct command is "fry" instead of "cook". Alternatively, the user needs to specify the stove again. Since the previous attempts with "cook" didn't work, maybe "fry" is the right verb. Let's try "fry white tuna with onion on stove".

That's not a verb I recognise.
