You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Backyard =-
Guess what, you are in a place we're calling a backyard. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a patio table. The patio table is stylish. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a patio chair. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make out a closed BBQ in the room.

There is a closed wooden door leading east. There is a closed screen door leading west. There is an exit to the north.

Okay, let me figure out what to do next. The user is in the backyard again after going south from the garden. They picked up the tomato and lettuce, which were in the garden. Now, they need to use those items. The goal is to cook a meal, so maybe they need to use the ingredients at the patio table.

The backyard has a closed BBQ. Maybe they need to open it. But the user has to interact with the environment. The previous actions were picking up items, so maybe now they need to place the tomato and lettuce on the patio table. But the table is empty. Wait, the user is at the backyard again, so maybe they need to put the items on the table to prepare the meal. Alternatively, the BBQ might need to be opened first. But the user hasn't interacted with the BBQ yet. Let me check the previous steps.

In the backyard, there's a closed BBQ. The user hasn't opened it yet. But the user has the tomato and lettuce. Maybe they need to use those items with the BBQ. But how? Perhaps the next step is to open the BBQ, then put the ingredients on the table, then cook them. But the user is at the backyard, and the patio table is there. So maybe the correct action is to put the tomato and lettuce on the table. But the user has to do that. Wait, the user is holding the items, so they need to place them on the table. But the table is empty. So the next action should be to put the tomato and lettuce on the patio table. But the user has to do that. However, the user's last action was going south, which brought them back to the backyard. Now, they have the tomato and lettuce. So the next step is to place them on the table. But the table is in the backyard. So the user needs to put the items there. But the user is at the backyard, so they can do that. Therefore, the next action should be to put the tomato on the table, then the lettuce. But the user might have to do that in sequence. However, the game might require specific commands. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to open the BBQ first. But the user hasn't done that yet. Let me check the available actions. The user can go north, east, west, or interact with objects. The BBQ is closed, so maybe they need to open it. But the user's goal is to cook, so maybe the BBQ is the cooking appliance. So first, open the BBQ, then put the ingredients on the table, then cook. But the user is at the backyard, so maybe the correct sequence is to open the BBQ, then put the items on the table. However, the user has the tomato and lettuce. So the next action should be to open the BBQ. Wait, but the user hasn't interacted with the BBQ yet. The description says "a closed BBQ in the room." So the user can open it. But the user's previous actions were picking up items. So maybe the next step is to open the BBQ. But the user is at the backyard, so maybe the correct action is to open the BBQ. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to put the items on the table first. But the table is empty. So the user has the tomato and lettuce, so they need to place them on the table. Therefore, the next action is to put the tomato on the table. But the user is holding the tomato, so they need to place it. The command would be "put tomato on patio table". But the game might require specific commands. However, the user's previous actions were "pick up tomato" and "pick up lettuce", so maybe the next step is to put them on the table. But the user is at the backyard, so the correct action is to put the items on the table. Therefore, the next action should be to put the tomato on the patio table. But the user has to do that. So the answer is "put tomato on patio table". But the user might have to do that. However, the user is in the backyard, and the patio table is there. So the correct command is to put the tomato on the table. Then the lettuce. But the user can only do one action at a time. So the next step is to put the tomato on the table.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal using the tomato and lettuce they picked up. They put both on the patio table and opened the BBQ. But when they tried to "cook meal with tomato and lettuce," it didn't work. So what's the next step?

Hmm, maybe the BBQ needs to be used in a different way. Since the BBQ is open now, perhaps they need to place the ingredients on the BBQ instead of the table. Or maybe there's a specific action required to cook. The user might need to "put tomato and lettuce on BBQ" or "cook tomato and lettuce". But the previous attempt didn't work. Alternatively, maybe the ingredients need to be on the table first, then the BBQ is used to cook them. Wait, the user already put them on the table. Maybe the BBQ is supposed to be used with the table. Or maybe the correct command is to "use BBQ" or "cook with BBQ". Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "light bbq" first. But the user hasn't done that yet. The initial steps were opening the BBQ, but maybe they need to light it before cooking. However, the game might not have a "light" command. Alternatively, the user might need to "cook tomato and lettuce on bbq". But the previous attempt didn't work. Maybe the correct action is to "cook meal" without specifying items, but that didn't work either. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "put tomato and lettuce on bbq" instead of the table. Let me check the previous steps again. The user put the tomato and lettuce on the patio table, then opened the BBQ. Maybe the BBQ is separate from the table. So perhaps the ingredients should be on the BBQ, not the table. So the next action should be to put the tomato and lettuce on the BBQ. But the user can only do one action at a time. So maybe first put the tomato on the BBQ, then the lettuce. But the user tried to cook them on the table. So the correct step is to put them on the BBQ. Therefore, the next action is "put tomato on bbq".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal using the tomato and lettuce. They picked up both items, placed them on the patio table, opened the BBQ, but when they tried to cook the meal, it didn't work. Then they tried putting the tomato on the BBQ, but the game said they need to take the tomato first. Wait, but they already picked up the tomato earlier. Maybe the issue is that the tomato is still on the table, so they need to pick it up again to put it on the BBQ. Let me check the previous steps.

The user picked up the tomato and lettuce in the garden, then went back to the backyard. They put the tomato and lettuce on the patio table. Then they opened the BBQ. When they tried to cook, it didn't work. Then they tried putting the tomato on the BBQ, but the game said they need to take the tomato first. That suggests that the tomato is not in their inventory anymore. Wait, maybe when they put the tomato on the table, they had to drop it, so it's no longer in their hands. So to put it on the BBQ, they need to pick it up again. But the user already picked it up once. Maybe the correct sequence is: pick up tomato, put it on the table, then pick it up again to put it on the BBQ. But that seems redundant. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to pick up the tomato from the table to put it on the BBQ. So the next action should be to pick up the tomato from the table. Then put it on the BBQ. But the user already has the tomato in their inventory? Or did they drop it when they put it on the table? The game's response says "You need to take the tomato first," which implies that the tomato is not in their inventory. So maybe after putting it on the table, it's no longer held, so they need to pick it up again. Therefore, the next action is to pick up the tomato from the table. Then put it on the BBQ. But the user might have to do that. So the correct command is "pick up tomato".

Okay, let's try to figure out what's going on here. The user is trying to cook a meal using the tomato and lettuce they picked up. They placed both on the patio table, opened the BBQ, but when they tried to cook, it didn't work. Then they tried putting the tomato on the BBQ but got an error. Then they picked up the lettuce again and tried putting it on the BBQ, but that also didn't work.

Hmm, maybe the BBQ isn't the right place to put the ingredients. The user has the tomato and lettuce on the table. Maybe they need to use the BBQ in a different way. Wait, the initial goal was to check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. But the user hasn't done that yet. Maybe they need to go back to the kitchen to find the recipe first. But the current location is the backyard. The user is at the backyard, which has a closed door east, screen door west, and exit north. The garden is south. But the user is in the backyard again. Maybe the cookbook is in the kitchen, which is accessible via the exit to the north. But the user hasn't checked that yet. So maybe the correct next step is to go north to the kitchen and check the cookbook. That way, they can find the recipe and follow the steps to cook the meal properly. The previous attempts to use the BBQ might be incorrect if the recipe requires something else. So the user should go north to the kitchen first.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the backyard again after going south from the garden. The BBQ is now opened and empty. They had previously tried to cook the meal but failed. The goal is to cook a delicious meal by checking the cookbook in the kitchen. The user might have forgotten to check the cookbook yet. So, the next step should be to go north to the kitchen to check the cookbook. That way, they can find the recipe and follow the correct steps to cook the meal.

Okay, the user is trying to find the cookbook in the kitchen but can't see it. They went north again, but that led them back to the garden. The original goal was to check the cookbook in the kitchen to get the recipe. Since the user is in the garden again, maybe they need to go south to the backyard and then find the cookbook there. Wait, but the backyard's description doesn't mention a cookbook. Maybe the cookbook is in the kitchen, which is accessible via the north exit. But when they tried going north earlier, they ended up in the garden again. Maybe there's a mistake in the game's layout. Alternatively, the user might need to interact with the BBQ or the patio table to find the cookbook. But according to the previous steps, the cookbook is in the kitchen. The user might need to go north again, but that led them back to the garden. Maybe the correct path is to go east or west from the backyard. The backyard has a closed wooden door east and a closed screen door west. Maybe the kitchen is through the east door. So the next action should be to go east to check the kitchen's door.

Okay, the user is stuck in the garden again after trying to go east or west from the backyard. The original goal was to check the cookbook in the kitchen. The user has been going back and forth between the garden and backyard. Maybe the correct approach is to go north again to the kitchen, even though it led them back to the garden. Alternatively, maybe the cookbook is in the backyard, but the description didn't mention it. The user needs to find a way to access the kitchen. Since the north exit was previously mentioned, maybe they need to try going north again, even if it loops back. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to interact with the BBQ or patio table to find the cookbook. But according to the game's previous steps, the cookbook is in the kitchen. So the next action should be to go north again to the kitchen, even if it's a loop.

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a patio chair. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

Okay, the user has been trying to cook a meal but keeps hitting roadblocks. They picked up tomato and lettuce, tried putting them on the BBQ, but it didn't work. Now they're looking around again. The key issue might be that they haven't found the cookbook yet. The original goal was to check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. But every time they try to go north, it loops back to the garden. Maybe the cookbook is in the backyard, but the description doesn't mention it. Alternatively, maybe the BBQ needs to be used correctly. Since the BBQ is open but empty, perhaps they need to add the ingredients properly. But the user already tried that. Maybe the correct action is to go north again, even though it's a loop, because the kitchen is supposed to be there. Alternatively, the user might need to interact with the patio table or chair. But the goal is to cook, so maybe the answer is to go north to the kitchen and check the cookbook, even if it's not visible. The next step should be to go north again.

Okay, the user has finally opened the wooden door leading east. Now they can proceed into the next room, which is likely the kitchen where the cookbook is located. The previous steps involved navigating through the garden and backyard, picking up ingredients, and trying to cook. Now, after opening the door, the next logical step is to check the kitchen for the cookbook. The user needs to go into the kitchen to find the recipe and then use the ingredients and BBQ properly. So the next action should be to go east into the kitchen.

Okay, the user has been cycling between the backyard, garden, and shed multiple times. The main goal is to cook a meal by checking the cookbook in the kitchen. The user tried going north but ended up in the garden again. The shed has a toolbox and workbench, but nothing on them. The key is to find the kitchen where the cookbook is. The user hasn't found the kitchen yet. The backyard has an open wooden door east, which led to the shed. Maybe the kitchen is through the screen door west in the backyard, but it's closed. Alternatively, the user needs to find another way. Since the user is in the shed, maybe they need to go west back to the backyard and try opening the screen door. But the user has been stuck in a loop. The correct next step is to go west from the shed to return to the backyard and try opening the screen door again.

<think>
Okay, the user has been trying to cook a meal with the tomato and lettuce but keeps getting errors. They have the cookbook in hand, so maybe they need to follow the recipe steps. The cookbook is on the table, so perhaps they need to check the recipe first. The oven is open, but the user might need to use the stove instead. Alternatively, the ingredients are on the patio table, so they need to take them to the kitchen. Wait, the user has the tomato and lettuce in their inventory? Or did they leave them in the backyard? The previous steps showed they put the tomato and lettuce on the patio table in the backyard. So maybe they need to go back to the backyard, pick up the ingredients, and then use the oven or stove in the kitchen. But the user is currently in the kitchen. So the next step is to go back to the backyard, pick up the tomato and lettuce, then take them to the kitchen and use the oven. But the user is in the kitchen now. Maybe they need to go west to the backyard, pick up the ingredients, then come back. But the user is stuck in the kitchen. The correct action is to go west to the backyard and pick up the ingredients again.
