You've entered a corridor.



There is an exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.

-= Kitchen =-
Wow! You're in a kitchen. The room is well lit.

Hey, want to see a fridge? Look over there, a fridge. The fridge is empty, what a horrible day! You make out a closed oven right there by you. You make out a table. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. You see a raw yellow potato, a yellow apple, a raw purple potato and a red hot pepper on the counter. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.

There is an open plain door leading north. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.

-= Kitchen =-
Wow! You're in a kitchen. The room is well lit.

Hey, want to see a fridge? Look over there, a fridge. The fridge is empty, what a horrible day! You make out a closed oven right there by you. You make out a table. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. You see a yellow apple, a raw purple potato and a red hot pepper on the counter. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.

There is an open plain door leading north. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.

-= Kitchen =-
Wow! You're in a kitchen. The room is well lit.

Hey, want to see a fridge? Look over there, a fridge. The fridge is empty, what a horrible day! You make out a closed oven right there by you. You make out a table. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. You see a yellow apple, a raw purple potato and a red hot pepper on the counter. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.

There is an open plain door leading north. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.
