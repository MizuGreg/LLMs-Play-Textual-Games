You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Bedroom =-
If you're wondering why everything seems so standard all of a sudden, it's because you've just sauntered into the bedroom. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

Look over there! a bed. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Hm. Oh well

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they've been moving through different rooms: bedroom, living room, corridor, bathroom. The goal seems to be to cook a meal using the cookbook in the kitchen. So far, they've been moving east, west, north, south, but haven't encountered the kitchen yet.

The current room is the bedroom again, and the prompt suggests going east. The user is asking if they're on the right track and if they're close to the goal. The previous moves have circled through the rooms, so maybe they need to find a different path. Since the kitchen hasn't been found yet, the next step should be to check if the bedroom's east exit leads to the kitchen. The user should go east again as per the提示 in the bedroom description. That makes sense because the cookbook is in the kitchen, so finding the kitchen is the next logical step. The user might have been going in circles, but following the east direction from the bedroom could lead to the kitchen. So the next action should be "go east".

<think>
Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the bedroom and living room. They keep going east and west, but it's not leading them to the kitchen where the cookbook is. The original goal was to cook a meal by checking the cookbook in the kitchen. So far, they haven't found the kitchen. The rooms they've visited are bedroom, living room, corridor, bathroom, but no kitchen yet. The prompts suggest that the kitchen is somewhere else. Maybe the correct path is to go north from the corridor instead of south or west. But the user has been going back and forth. The next step should be to try a different direction. Since the bedroom's east exit is mentioned, maybe that's the way to go. But the user has already tried that. Alternatively, maybe the living room's north exit leads to the kitchen. The user needs to break the cycle and find the kitchen. The next action should be to go north from the living room.

Okay, the user is trying to navigate through the rooms to find the kitchen where the cookbook is. So far, they've been moving between bedroom, living room, corridor, bathroom, and back. The current room is the corridor, and the提示 says to try going south or west. The user has been going back and forth, possibly missing the correct path.

The original goal is to cook a meal by checking the cookbook in the kitchen. The user hasn't found the kitchen yet. The corridor's exits are north, south, west. The previous attempts to go north from the living room led back to the corridor. The user needs to find a different path. Since the corridor's south or west exits are suggested, maybe going south from the corridor would lead to the kitchen. Alternatively, west might be the right direction. The user should try going south next to break the cycle and find the kitchen.

-= Livingroom =-
You've entered a livingroom.

You make out a sofa. The sofa is comfy. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is an exit to the north. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the living room, bedroom, and corridor. They've tried going north, south, east, and west multiple times without finding the kitchen where the cookbook is. The original goal is to cook a meal by checking the cookbook in the kitchen. So far, they haven't found the kitchen yet. The current room is the living room again, with exits to north and west. The user needs to break the cycle and find the correct path to the kitchen. Maybe the correct direction is north from the living room, but that led them back to the corridor. Alternatively, maybe west from the living room leads to the kitchen. The user should try going west again to see if that leads them to the kitchen.

-= Bedroom =-
If you're wondering why everything seems so standard all of a sudden, it's because you've just sauntered into the bedroom. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

Look over there! a bed. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Hm. Oh well

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

You make out a sofa. The sofa is comfy. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is an exit to the north. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the living room, bedroom, and corridor. They've tried going north, south, east, and west multiple times without finding the kitchen where the cookbook is. The original goal is to cook a meal by checking the cookbook in the kitchen. So far, they haven't found the kitchen yet. The current room is the corridor, with exits to north, south, and west. The user needs to break the cycle and find the correct path to the kitchen. Maybe the correct direction is south from the corridor, but that led them back to the living room. Alternatively, maybe west from the corridor leads to the kitchen. The user should try going south again to see if that leads them to the kitchen.

If you're wondering why everything seems so standard all of a sudden, it's because you've just sauntered into the bedroom. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

Look over there! a bed. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Hm. Oh well

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

-= Bedroom =-
If you're wondering why everything seems so standard all of a sudden, it's because you've just sauntered into the bedroom. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

Look over there! a bed. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Hm. Oh well

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

There is an exit to the north. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.
