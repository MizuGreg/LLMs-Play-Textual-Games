You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Bathroom =-
You've just walked into a bathroom.

You make out a toilet. The toilet is white. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the toilet.

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door.

-= Kitchen =-
Look around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen.

You see a closed fridge in the room. You can make out an oven. You smell an intriguing smell, and follow it to a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a banana, a raw purple potato, a green apple and a green hot pepper. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.

There is a closed frosted-glass door leading east. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what to do next. The user is in a kitchen game, trying to cook a meal. They've already taken some ingredients: a yellow bell pepper from the fridge, a raw purple potato from the counter, and tried to take a green hot pepper but couldn't because they were carrying too much.

The goal is to cook a delicious meal using the cookbook. So far, they have two items: the yellow bell pepper and the potato. The green hot pepper was dropped, but maybe they can take it again. Wait, the user tried to take the green hot pepper but was told they're carrying too many things. They have the yellow bell pepper and the potato, which is two items. Maybe they can drop one of them to take the green pepper. But the last action was dropping the green hot pepper, and the system said they haven't got that, so maybe it's still in the counter.

Alternatively, maybe they need to use the cookbook to find a recipe. The cookbook is on the table, and they took it earlier. The recipe might require specific ingredients. The available ingredients in the kitchen are a banana, raw purple potato, green apple, green hot pepper, yellow bell pepper, lettuce, and orange bell pepper. The user has the yellow bell pepper and the potato. Maybe the recipe requires more items, but they can't carry all of them. So perhaps they need to find a recipe that uses the available ingredients.

Wait, the user is at the kitchen, and the next step is to check the cookbook. But they already took the cookbook. Maybe they need to look at the recipe in the cookbook. However, the game's previous interactions show that when they looked around, they couldn't see anything, so maybe they need to use the cookbook to find the recipe. But the game's interface might not allow that. Alternatively, they need to cook using the ingredients they have.

The user has the yellow bell pepper and the potato. Maybe the recipe requires those two. But the game's previous steps show that the user needs to follow the recipe. Since the user is trying to cook, perhaps the next step is to use the stove. The stove is in the kitchen, and they need to cook the ingredients. But the stove is conventional, so maybe they need to put the ingredients on it. However, the user hasn't used the stove yet.

Alternatively, maybe they need to find the recipe in the cookbook. The cookbook is on the table, and they have it. So maybe they need to open the cookbook to see the recipe. But the game's previous steps show that when they tried to look around, they couldn't see anything. So maybe the next action is to check the cookbook's contents. But the game's commands are limited to moving and taking items. Since the user is in the kitchen, maybe they need to use the stove or the oven. The oven is mentioned, so maybe they need to use that.

But the user's last action was dropping the green hot pepper, which wasn't possible. So perhaps the next step is to take the green hot pepper again. Wait, the user had the yellow bell pepper and the potato. If they drop the potato, they can take the green hot pepper. Then they can have three items: yellow bell pepper, green hot pepper, and maybe the potato. But the user is carrying too many things. Alternatively, maybe the recipe requires two items, so they can proceed with the ones they have.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to cook the potato and the bell pepper. The stove is there, so they can put the ingredients on the stove. But the game's commands might not allow that. The user's previous actions were taking items, so maybe the next step is to use the stove. But the game's interface might not have a "cook" command. The user needs to follow the steps to cook, which might involve using the stove. However, the game's previous steps don't show that. The user is in the kitchen, and the next action is to use the stove or oven. But the user hasn't used the stove yet.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to find the recipe in the cookbook. Since the user has the cookbook, they might need to look at it. But the game's commands don't include reading the cookbook. The user has to take actions like taking items, opening doors, etc. So maybe the next step is to use the stove. The stove is in the kitchen, so the user can go to the stove. But the user is already in the kitchen. The stove is conventional, so maybe they can put the ingredients on it. However, the game's commands might not allow that. The user needs to follow the steps to cook, which might involve using the stove. But the game's interface might not have a "cook" command.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, the user is stuck in the kitchen game. They've taken some ingredients but can't proceed because they can't use the stove. The previous attempts to use the stove were rejected. The user needs to find the right command to cook the meal.

Looking back, the user has the cookbook, which is essential for the recipe. Maybe they need to check the cookbook to find the recipe steps. But the game's interface might not allow reading the cookbook directly. Alternatively, maybe the correct action is to use the oven instead of the stove. The oven is mentioned in the kitchen description. The user might have to use the oven to cook the ingredients.

Alternatively, the user might need to put the ingredients on the stove. The correct command could be "put [ingredient] on stove" but the game might not recognize that. Since the user can't use the stove, maybe the next step is to check the oven. The oven is in the kitchen, so the user can go to the oven. The command would be "go to oven" or "use oven". But the game's previous responses didn't accept "use stove", so maybe "use oven" is the correct command.

Alternatively, the user might need to open the oven first. The oven is closed? The description says "you see an oven" but doesn't mention it being closed. So maybe the correct action is to use the oven. The user should try "use oven" as the next command.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, the user is stuck in the kitchen game. They've tried using the stove and oven multiple times, but the game doesn't recognize those commands. They have the cookbook, which is essential for the recipe. Maybe the correct action is to check the cookbook to find the recipe steps. But the game's interface might not allow reading the cookbook directly. Alternatively, maybe the correct command is to "open cookbook" to see the recipe. Since the user has the cookbook, they need to use it to find the recipe. The previous steps show that the user took the cookbook, so the next step is to use it. The command should be "open cookbook" to access the recipe. That makes sense because the user needs to follow the recipe to cook the meal. So the next action is to open the cookbook.

It isn't something you can open.
