Hey, want to see a fridge? Look over there, a fridge. A closed conventional looking oven is close by. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Look over there! a counter. You shudder, but continue examining the counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. You scan the room, seeing a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is a closed frosted-glass door leading south. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door. There is an exit to the west.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe in the cookbook. The recipe requires dice the block of cheese, fry the block of cheese, dice the green bell pepper, roast the green bell pepper, slice the yellow onion, roast the yellow onion, and then prepare the meal.

So far, the user has looked at the cookbook, tried to dice the block of cheese, but couldn't see it. Then they looked at the red hot pepper, which they didn't want to eat, then the raw purple potato, which looked tasty. Then they tried to slice the yellow onion, but couldn't see it. Then they looked at the yellow onion and couldn't see it either. Then they looked at the stove, which is useful for frying.

Wait, the ingredients needed are a block of cheese, green bell pepper, and yellow onion. The user has looked at the green bell pepper (but didn't dice it) and the yellow onion (but didn't slice it). The block of cheese was mentioned in the recipe but the user couldn't see it. However, in the kitchen description, there's a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato, a cookbook, a knife, a fridge, an oven, a table, and a stove. But the ingredients required are cheese, green bell pepper, and yellow onion. The user hasn't found the block of cheese yet. Maybe the block of cheese is in the fridge? Because the fridge is closed, but maybe they need to open it. Alternatively, maybe the block of cheese is on the counter, but the user hasn't looked there yet.

Wait, in the kitchen description, the counter has a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato, a cookbook, and a knife. The block of cheese isn't mentioned there. The user hasn't checked the fridge yet. The fridge is closed, so maybe they need to open it. The recipe says to dice the block of cheese, so the user needs to find the cheese first. Then, they need to dice it. But the user hasn't found the cheese yet. So the next step would be to check the fridge. The user can't proceed without the cheese. So the next action should be to open the fridge to look for the block of cheese. Once they have that, they can dice it, then fry it. Then proceed with the other steps.

But the user is at the kitchen, and the fridge is closed. So the next action should be to open the fridge. Then check inside for the block of cheese. If the cheese is there, they can take it. Then proceed to dice it. So the correct next action is to open the fridge.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to dice the block of cheese. They have the knife from the counter earlier. Maybe they need to use the knife on the block of cheese. But the previous attempts resulted in errors. The system keeps asking for the correct command. The user tried "use knife" but it didn't work. Then they tried "use knife on block of cheese", which was rejected. The correct command might be "dice block of cheese with knife" or similar. But the system might expect a specific syntax. Since the user has the knife, they need to use it on the cheese. The correct action is probably "use knife on block of cheese", but the system says that's not a verb. Maybe the correct command is "dice block of cheese" without specifying the tool, assuming the knife is available. But earlier, when they tried "dice block of cheese", the system asked what to use to dice it. So maybe the correct command is "use knife on block of cheese" but the system doesn't recognize it. Alternatively, the user might need to first pick up the knife, but the knife is on the counter. Wait, the user already has the knife from the counter. So the next step is to use the knife on the cheese. The system might be expecting "cut block of cheese with knife" or "dice block of cheese". Since the user is stuck, the next action should be to use the knife on the cheese, even if it's rejected, but the system might accept "dice block of cheese" once the knife is used. Alternatively, the correct command is "cut block of cheese" with the knife. But the system's previous response said "That's not a verb I recognise." So maybe the correct verb is "dice" but with the correct syntax. The user needs to use the knife to dice the cheese. The correct command is "use knife on block of cheese". Even though the system rejected it, maybe the user should try that again. Alternatively, the system might accept "dice block of cheese" if the knife is already in hand. But the user has to use the knife. So the next action is "use knife on block of cheese".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to fry the block of cheese. They have the knife and the stove. The previous attempts to use "fry" as a verb didn't work. The system might expect a different command. Maybe "cook" or "heat" instead of "fry". Alternatively, the correct command could be "put block of cheese on stove" or "heat block of cheese on stove". Since the user has to use the stove, perhaps the correct action is "put block of cheese on stove" to start frying. Let me check the previous steps. The user diced the cheese, so now they need to fry it. The stove is available. The correct command might be "put block of cheese on stove" or "fry block of cheese with stove". But the system says "That's not a verb I recognise." So maybe the correct verb is "cook" or "heat". Alternatively, the user might need to use the stove's function. Maybe "use stove to cook block of cheese". But the system didn't accept that. Alternatively, "cook block of cheese on stove". The user needs to find the right phrasing. Since the previous attempt was "use stove to fry block of cheese", which was rejected, maybe the correct command is "fry block of cheese on stove". But the system says that's not a verb. Maybe the correct verb is "cook". So the next action should be "cook block of cheese on stove".

Okay, the user is stuck on the "roast green bell pepper" command. They've tried multiple variations, but the system keeps rejecting them. Let me think about the possible correct command. The recipe says to "roast the green bell pepper," so maybe the correct verb is "roast" but with the correct syntax. The user has the green bell pepper and the stove. Maybe the correct command is "roast green bell pepper on stove" but the system doesn't recognize it. Alternatively, perhaps the correct verb is "cook" instead of "roast". Or maybe "put green bell pepper on stove" to start roasting. Since the user has already diced the pepper, the next step is to roast it. The system might expect "roast" as a verb, but the previous attempts didn't work. Maybe the correct command is "roast green bell pepper" without specifying the stove, assuming the stove is available. Let me try that.
