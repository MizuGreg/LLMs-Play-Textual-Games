Hey, want to see a toilet? Look over there, a toilet. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the toilet.

You need an exit without a door? You should try going north.

You arrive in a kitchen. An usual one.

You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop, a white onion, a red bell pepper and a carrot. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a closed oven. You smell an intriguing smell, and follow it to a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. You can make out a counter. On the counter you can make out a banana. Hey, want to see a stove? Look over there, a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.

There is an open frosted-glass door leading east. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one. There is an exit to the west.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the cookbook in the kitchen. So far, they've checked the cookbook, found the recipe for banana, diced the banana, but then realized they need a knife. They took the knife from the table.

Now, the next step would be to follow the recipe directions. The recipe says "dice the banana," which they did, but then "roast the banana." Since they have the knife, maybe they need to roast the banana. But how? The kitchen has a stove, so maybe they need to put the diced banana on the stove. But the stove is empty. Wait, the recipe says "roast the banana," so maybe they need to use the stove to roast it. 

But the user has the knife, so maybe the next action is to roast the banana. However, the available actions are limited to moving directions or interacting with objects. The user is in the kitchen, and the stove is there. So the next step would be to go to the stove and roast the banana. But the user has already taken the knife, so maybe they need to use the knife to roast the banana. Wait, but roasting typically involves heating, so maybe they need to put the banana on the stove. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the knife to cut the banana again, but they already diced it. The recipe says "dice the banana" and then "roast the banana." So after dicing, the next step is to roast. Since the stove is in the kitchen, the user should go to the stove and roast the banana. But the user is currently in the kitchen, so the next action would be to go to the stove. But the stove is already in the kitchen. Wait, the user is in the kitchen, and the stove is there. So the next action is to roast the banana on the stove. But how to do that? Maybe the user needs to put the diced banana on the stove. So the next action would be to roast the banana. But the system might require using the stove. So the user should try to roast the banana using the stove. Therefore, the next command is to roast the banana.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the recipe from the cookbook. The recipe says to dice the banana, then roast it, and prepare the meal. So far, they've diced the banana and taken the knife. The next step is to roast the banana. But the system didn't recognize "roast the banana" as a valid command.

Hmm, maybe the correct command is to use the stove. Since the stove is in the kitchen, perhaps the user needs to go to the stove first. The previous attempt to roast the banana directly didn't work. So maybe the correct action is to go to the stove and then roast the banana there. Alternatively, maybe the command should be "put banana on stove" or "roast banana on stove". But the system might expect a specific verb. Let me check the available objects: there's a stove, a knife, a cookbook, a banana, etc. The user has the knife, so maybe they need to use the stove. The correct command might be "use stove" or "roast banana". But since "roast the banana" wasn't accepted, maybe the correct verb is "roast" without the object, but that's unclear. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to put the banana on the stove first. So the next action could be "put banana on stove" or "roast banana". But since the system didn't accept "roast the banana", perhaps the correct command is "roast banana" without the article. Let me try that.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the recipe. They have the knife, diced the banana, and now they need to roast it. The previous attempt to put the banana on the stove failed because they didn't have the banana with them. So first, they need to take the banana from the counter. The banana is on the counter, so the next step is to take it. Then, they can put it on the stove. But wait, the user already diced the banana. Wait, the recipe says "dice the banana" and then "roast the banana". So maybe the diced banana is already in hand, but the system says they need to take the banana first. Maybe the banana is still on the counter, and they need to take it before proceeding. So the correct action is to take the banana from the counter. Then, put it on the stove. But the user already diced it, so maybe they need to put the diced banana on the stove. But the system says they need to take the banana first. So the next step is to take the banana.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the recipe to cook a meal. They've taken the banana, put it on the stove, and tried to prepare the meal. The system says they still miss something. The original recipe steps were dice the banana, roast the banana, and prepare the meal. The user has done the first two steps. Maybe the third step is to actually eat the meal. But the system didn't accept "enjoy meal" as a command. Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "eat banana" since that's what's on the stove. Or perhaps "roast banana" again. Wait, the user already roasted the banana by putting it on the stove. Maybe the meal is considered prepared, so the next step is to take the roasted banana and eat it. But the system might require a specific command. The user has to follow the steps exactly. The recipe says "prepare meal", so maybe the correct command is "prepare meal" again. But the system said that's not a verb. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to take the roasted banana and eat it. So the next action is "take roasted banana" or "eat banana". But the system might not recognize those. Alternatively, since the user is in the kitchen, maybe they need to go to the table where the cookbook and knife are. But the goal is to enjoy the meal. The user might need to "eat" the meal, but the system doesn't accept that. Maybe the correct command is "finish meal" or "complete meal". But the system is strict. The user has to follow the steps. The last step is "prepare meal", so maybe the correct command is "prepare meal" again. But the system said that's not a verb. Hmm. Maybe the user needs to "serve meal" or "serve banana". Alternatively, since the user has the knife, maybe they need to cut the banana again, but that's already done. I'm stuck. The system says "you still miss something". Maybe the correct command is "eat" without the object. But the system says it's not a verb. Wait, maybe the user needs to "roast" the banana again. But they already put it on the stove.

But the system says it's not a verb. Maybe the user needs to "consume banana". But that's not a standard command. Alternatively, the user needs to "finish" the meal. But the system doesn't accept that. I'm not sure. The user has to make a guess. The last step in the recipe is "prepare meal", so maybe the correct command is "prepare meal" again.
