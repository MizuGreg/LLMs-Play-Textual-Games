<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they need to cook a meal by finding a cookbook in the kitchen. So far, they've been moving through a corridor, a bathroom, and back and forth between them. The corridor has exits to east, south, and west, but the bathroom is a dead end except for going back north.

The user's goal is to find the cookbook in the kitchen. But the current locations are corridor and bathroom. The problem is that the kitchen hasn't been mentioned yet. The exits in the corridor are east, south, and west. The bathroom is south of the corridor, but going north from there brings them back to the corridor. So maybe the kitchen is in another direction, like east? But the east exit from the corridor is described as having no door. However, the user hasn't explored that yet.

Wait, the user has been going south to the bathroom and then back north. They haven't tried going east. The initial corridor description says there's an exit to the east. Maybe the kitchen is east of the corridor. But the user hasn't tried that yet. The challenge is that the game might be designed to loop between corridor and bathroom, so the user needs to find another way.

Alternatively, maybe the kitchen is in the west exit of the corridor. But the west exit isn't blocked. However, the user hasn't explored that either. The problem is that the user is stuck between corridor and bathroom, not progressing towards the kitchen. The cookbook is in the kitchen, so the user needs to find the kitchen.

But the current exits from the corridor are east, south, and west. The user has tried south (bathroom) and north (back to corridor). Maybe the east exit is the way to go. The east exit is described as having no door. Maybe that's the kitchen. The user hasn't tried going east yet. So the next logical step is to go east to check if that's the kitchen where the cookbook is located. The user's previous actions have been moving between corridor and bathroom, so they need to try the east exit to proceed towards the kitchen.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is trying to find the cookbook in the kitchen to cook a meal. So far, they've been moving through a corridor, bathroom, and bedroom. The corridor has exits to east, south, and west. The bathroom is south of the corridor, and the bedroom is east. The user tried going east to the bedroom, then west back to the corridor.

The goal is to reach the kitchen. The kitchen hasn't been mentioned yet. The corridor's east exit led to the bedroom, which doesn't have the cookbook. The south exit leads to the bathroom, which also doesn't have it. The west exit is still unexplored. Maybe the kitchen is west of the corridor? But the user hasn't tried that yet. Alternatively, maybe the kitchen is in another direction not yet explored. But according to the current map, the corridor's exits are east, south, and west. The user needs to check the west exit next. If the west exit leads to another area, maybe the kitchen is there. Alternatively, maybe the kitchen is in the east, but the bedroom didn't have the cookbook. So the next logical step is to go west from the corridor to check that exit. The user's previous action was going west, which brought them back to the corridor. So maybe the west exit leads to another room, perhaps the kitchen. The user needs to try that.

-= Livingroom =-
You are in a livingroom. A standard one. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."

Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a sofa. The sofa is comfy. But there isn't a thing on it.

You need an exit without a door? You should try going east. There is an exit to the south.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to find the cookbook in the kitchen to cook a meal. So far, they've explored the corridor, bathroom, bedroom, and living room. The corridor has exits to east, south, and west. The bathroom is south, leading to a toilet. The bedroom is east, which had a bed. The living room is east of the corridor, with a sofa. The user has been moving between these areas, but the kitchen hasn't been found yet.

The current location is the corridor again. The exits are the same: east, south, west. The user has tried east (bedroom, living room), south (bathroom), and west (which led to the living room via the corridor). Wait, no, earlier when they went west from the corridor, they went to the living room? Or was it the other way around? Let me check the history.

Wait, the user went from the corridor to the bedroom (east), then back to the corridor, then to the living room (east again?), then back to the corridor. So maybe the east exit from the corridor leads to the bedroom, then the living room? Or maybe the living room is connected differently. The key is that the kitchen hasn't been found yet. The user needs to find the kitchen where the cookbook is.

The corridor's exits are east, south, west. The user has tried south (bathroom), east (bedroom and living room), and west. Maybe the west exit leads to the kitchen? But in the previous steps, going west from the corridor led to the living room. Wait, no. Let me check the previous steps again.

Wait, the user first went south to the bathroom, then north back to corridor. Then went south again to bathroom, then north to corridor. Then went east to bedroom, then west back to corridor. Then went east again to living room, then west back to corridor. So the corridor is the central area. The kitchen must be in one of the exits not yet explored. But all exits from the corridor have been tried: east (bedroom, living room), south (bathroom), west (which led to living room? Or maybe another room?).

Wait, maybe the west exit from the corridor leads to the kitchen. But in the previous step, when the user was in the corridor, they went west and ended up in the living room. Wait, no. Let me check the history again.

The user's last action was "go east" from the living room, which brought them back to the corridor. So the living room is east of the corridor. The west exit from the corridor would be another direction. Maybe the kitchen is west of the corridor. But the user hasn't tried that yet. Wait, in the previous steps, when the user was in the corridor, they tried going west, but according to the history, when they went west from the corridor, they ended up in the living room? Or was it another room?

Wait, the user's previous steps:

- Started in corridor.

- Went south to bathroom.

- North back to corridor.

- South again to bathroom.

- North to corridor.

- East to bedroom.

- West back to corridor.

- East to living room.

- West back to corridor.

So the corridor is the central point. The east exit leads to bedroom and then living room. The south exit is bathroom. The west exit hasn't been explored beyond the corridor. Wait, when the user was in the corridor, they tried going west, but according to the history, when they went west from the corridor, they ended up in the living room? Or was that a mistake?

Wait, the user's last interaction was in the corridor (0/11), and the previous step was going east from the living room to corridor. So the west exit from the corridor hasn't been explored yet. Maybe the west exit leads to the kitchen. The user needs to try going west from the corridor again to check that exit. Since the kitchen hasn't been found yet, and the west exit hasn't been explored, that's the next logical step.

Okay, the user has been moving around between the corridor, bathroom, living room, bedroom, and back. They need to find the kitchen where the cookbook is. So far, they've tried all exits from the corridor but haven't found the kitchen. The bathroom is south, bedroom east, living room east, and west seems to loop back. Maybe the kitchen is in a different direction not yet explored. Wait, the corridor's west exit was tried but led back to the corridor. Maybe the user needs to try a different approach. Since the cookbook is in the kitchen, perhaps the kitchen is connected to the bedroom or living room. The user should check the bedroom again. The bedroom has a bed, but maybe there's a hidden exit or something. Alternatively, the living room might have a hidden exit. The user needs to explore these areas more thoroughly. The next step is to go west from the corridor again, but that didn't work. Maybe the user needs to check the east exit again, but that led to the bedroom. Wait, maybe the kitchen is in the east, but the user hasn't checked the east exit properly. Alternatively, the user might need to look for clues in the rooms they've visited. The bathroom has a toilet, the bedroom has a bed, the living room has a sofa. Maybe the kitchen is connected to the living room. The user should try going east from the living room again. But the user is currently in the corridor. The next action should be to go east from the corridor to the bedroom again, then check if there's another exit there. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go south to the bathroom again. But the user has tried that. Maybe the user is missing something. The key is to keep exploring all exits until the kitchen is found. The next step is to go east from the corridor to the bedroom again.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the corridor, bathroom, and bedroom. They've tried all exits multiple times without finding the kitchen. The cookbook is in the kitchen, so the user needs to find it. The corridor's exits are east, south, and west. The bathroom is south, the bedroom is east, and the west exit hasn't been explored beyond the corridor. Maybe the kitchen is west of the corridor, but the user hasn't tried that yet. Every time they go west, they end up back in the corridor. The user needs to try going west again to see if that leads to the kitchen. Alternatively, maybe the kitchen is in the east, but the bedroom and living room don't have the cookbook. The user should try all exits again. The next step is to go west from the corridor to check.

-= Bathroom =-
You've entered a bathroom.

Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a toilet. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. However, the toilet, like an empty toilet, has nothing on it.

You need an exit without a door? You should try going north.
