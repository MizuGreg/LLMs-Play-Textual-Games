You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Livingroom =-
You find yourself in a livingroom. An usual kind of place. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You make out a sofa. The sofa is comfy. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. Hm. Oh well

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one. There is an exit to the north. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. A typical kind of place.

You can make out a closed fridge. You can make out an oven. Oh, great. Here's a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is a closed plain door leading north. There is a closed sliding patio door leading south. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.
