You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. A typical one.

You can make out an opened conventional looking fridge right there by you. The fridge contains a raw red tuna, a raw white tuna, a raw red potato, a white onion and a raw pork chop. You see an oven. You scan the room for a table, and you find a table! The table is massive. On the table you can make out a knife. You smell a sickening smell, and follow it to a counter! You see a green hot pepper, a green bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a banana and a cookbook on the counter. You make out a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.
