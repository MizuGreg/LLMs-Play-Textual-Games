You're now in a kitchen.

You see a fridge. The fridge contains a white onion, a raw white tuna and a yellow onion. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see an oven. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. On the counter you see a red apple, a red hot pepper, a green apple and a yellow apple. You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.
