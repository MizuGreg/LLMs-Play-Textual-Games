-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. An usual kind of place.

You can make out an opened conventional looking fridge here. The fridge contains a red bell pepper, a raw red tuna and a green bell pepper. You can see a closed oven nearby. What's that over there? It looks like it's a table. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. You see a yellow apple, a raw yellow potato, a red apple and a knife on the counter. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a stove. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is an open plain door leading north. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.

You are in a kitchen. An usual kind of place.

You can make out an opened conventional looking fridge here. The fridge contains a raw red tuna and a green bell pepper. You can see an opened oven nearby. The oven is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! What's that over there? It looks like it's a table. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The table is massive. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You think about smashing the table to bits, throwing the bits in a fire, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. You see a yellow apple, a raw yellow potato and a red apple on the counter. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a stove. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is an open plain door leading north. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.

You are in a kitchen. An usual kind of place.

You can make out an opened conventional looking fridge here. The fridge contains a raw red tuna and a green bell pepper. You can see an opened oven nearby. The oven is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! What's that over there? It looks like it's a table. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The table is massive. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You think about smashing the table to bits, throwing the bits in a fire, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. You see a yellow apple, a raw yellow potato and a red apple on the counter. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a stove. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is an open plain door leading north. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.
