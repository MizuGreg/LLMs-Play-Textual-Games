You're now in the kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You can make out a fridge. The fridge contains a raw white tuna, a raw pork chop, a block of cheese, a carrot, a red bell pepper, a white onion, a raw red tuna and a lettuce. You see a closed oven. You make out a table. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You can see a counter. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a counter, go to TextWorld. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a tomato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what to do next. The user is in the kitchen, and the goal is to cook a meal using the ingredients found there. The initial steps were trying to open the cookbook, but it wasn't possible. Then they looked around, but didn't find the cookbook. Now, the user is asking if they're on the right track and what the next action should be.

First, I need to recall the environment. The kitchen has a fridge with various raw ingredients, a closed oven, a table with nothing on it, a counter with more ingredients like a cookbook, a knife, and other vegetables. The stove is empty. The user already checked the counter and found the cookbook, but maybe they couldn't open it. Wait, the first attempt was to open the cookbook, but the system said it wasn't something you could open. Then the user looked around again and didn't find it. But the counter has the cookbook. Maybe the cookbook is closed, so the next step is to open it.

But the user tried to open it and got a message that it's not something you can open. Maybe the cookbook is on the counter, so the correct action is to take the cookbook first. Then, once you have it, you can open it. So the next step should be to take the cookbook from the counter. Let me check the items again. On the counter, there's a cookbook and a knife. So the user needs to pick up the cookbook. Then, after taking it, they can try opening it. So the next action should be to take the cookbook.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the recipe from the cookbook. The first step was to slice the red hot pepper, but they needed a knife. They took the knife from the counter, but then tried to slice the pepper again and got the same message. Wait, maybe they didn't use the knife yet. Let me check the previous steps.

The user had the red hot pepper and the knife. The error message says "Cutting something requires a knife." So maybe they need to use the knife on the pepper. The command should be "slice red hot pepper with knife" or something similar. But in the game's context, maybe the correct syntax is just "slice red hot pepper" after taking the knife. But the system says it's still requiring a knife. Maybe the knife isn't equipped yet. So the next step is to use the knife on the pepper. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to put the knife in their inventory first. Wait, they took the knife from the counter, so it's in their inventory. Then they should be able to slice the pepper with it. Maybe the correct command is "slice red hot pepper" again, but the system is prompting for the knife. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the knife first. But the previous attempt to slice the pepper without specifying the knife didn't work. So the next step is to use the knife on the pepper. The correct command would be "slice red hot pepper with knife" or "use knife on red hot pepper". But the game might expect a different syntax. Let me think about the possible commands. Since the user has the knife, they need to apply it to the pepper. So the next action should be to slice the pepper with the knife. But the system might require the exact command. Maybe "slice red hot pepper" is insufficient because the knife isn't being used. So the user needs to specify using the knife. But in the game's context, maybe the correct command is just "slice red hot pepper" again, and the system will recognize that the knife is available. But the previous attempt failed. Maybe the user needs to use the knife first. Wait, the user took the knife, so it's in their inventory. The next step is to slice the pepper with the knife. So the command should be "slice red hot pepper with knife" or "use knife on red hot pepper". But the game might expect a different phrasing. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to put the knife in the correct place. But the user is holding the knife. So the next action is to slice the pepper with the knife. The correct command would be "slice red hot pepper" again, but the system might require the knife to be used. Since the user has the knife, maybe the next step is to slice the pepper. The system's message says "Cutting something requires a knife," which implies that the knife is needed. So the user needs to use the knife on the pepper. Therefore, the next action is to slice the red hot pepper with the knife. The command would be "slice red hot pepper with knife" or "use knife on red hot pepper". But the game might accept "slice red hot pepper" again, assuming the knife is available. However, the previous attempt failed, so maybe the correct command is to use the knife on the pepper. So the next action is "use knife on red hot pepper".

Okay, let's see. The user is following the recipe from the cookbook. The current step is slicing the red hot pepper with the knife, which they just did. The next step in the recipe is to fry the red hot pepper. So after slicing, they need to fry it. The next action should be to fry the red hot pepper. But wait, do they have the ingredients for that? The recipe says "fry the red hot pepper" after slicing. So the user needs to perform the fry action. The correct command would be "fry red hot pepper". Let me check if there's any other step needed.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the recipe. They sliced the red hot pepper, but now they need to fry it. The previous attempt to fry the pepper didn't work because "fry" wasn't a recognized verb. Maybe they need to use the stove. The user tried to heat the stove, and the system responded positively. Now, the next step would be to use the stove to fry the pepper. Since the stove is now heated, they can put the pepper on it. The correct command would be "put red hot pepper on stove" or "fry red hot pepper on stove". But the system might expect a specific command. Alternatively, maybe they need to use the stove's function. Since the user heated the stove, the next action is to fry the pepper there. So the command should be "fry red hot pepper on stove" or similar. But the system might accept "fry red hot pepper" if the stove is already heated. However, the user previously tried "fry" and it didn't work. So maybe the correct command is to use the stove's action. The next step is to put the pepper on the stove to fry it. The command would be "put red hot pepper on stove".

Okay, let's try to figure out the next step. The user is trying to follow the recipe from the cookbook. The recipe says to slice the red hot pepper, fry it, then slice the white tuna, roast it, and prepare the meal.

So far, the user has sliced the red hot pepper. Now, the next step is to fry it. But the user tried "fry red hot pepper on stove" and it didn't work. The available commands include "put ... on ...", so maybe the correct action is to put the sliced red hot pepper on the stove. Since the stove is already heated, putting the pepper on it would start the frying process. The command should be "put red hot pepper on stove". Let me check the previous steps again. The user had the red hot pepper and the knife. They sliced it, then tried to fry it. The system didn't recognize "fry", so using "put on stove" might be the right approach. So the next action is to put the sliced red hot pepper on the stove.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to fry the red hot pepper. They've already sliced it and put it on the stove. The previous attempts to use "fry" as a verb didn't work, so maybe the correct command is "put red hot pepper on stove" again. But the system says that's not a verb. Wait, the available commands include "put ... on ...", so maybe the user needs to use that structure. The user already put the pepper on the stove, but perhaps they need to use the correct syntax. The system might require "fry" to be part of the command. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the stove's function. Since the stove is already heated, putting the pepper on it should start the frying. The correct command is "put red hot pepper on stove", but the system is not recognizing it. Maybe the user needs to use "fry" with the stove. But the available commands don't have "fry" as a verb. The user might need to use "cook" instead. But the recipe says "fry". Hmm. The user has already put the pepper on the stove, so maybe the next step is to move to the next ingredient. The recipe says to slice the white tuna next. So the user should take the white tuna from the fridge, slice it, and roast it. The correct command would be "take white tuna from fridge", then "slice white tuna", then "roast white tuna". But the user is stuck on the frying step. Maybe the system is expecting "fry" to be used with the stove. But since "fry" isn't a recognized verb, the user should use "put on stove" again. However, the system says that's not a verb. This is confusing. The user needs to follow the recipe steps, so after frying the pepper, they should move to slicing the tuna. So the next action is to take the white tuna from the fridge.

Okay, the user has taken the white tuna from the fridge. The next step in the recipe is to slice the white tuna. So the correct command would be "slice white tuna". Let me check the previous steps. The user had the red hot pepper sliced and put on the stove. Now they need to slice the white tuna. The command should be "slice white tuna".

You're now in the kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You can make out a fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop, a block of cheese, a carrot, a red bell pepper, a white onion, a raw red tuna and a lettuce. You see a closed oven. You make out a table. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You can see a counter. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a counter, go to TextWorld. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a raw yellow potato, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a tomato and a raw red potato. You see a stove. On the stove you can see a sliced red hot pepper.

Okay, let's try to figure out the next step. The user is trying to roast the white tuna. They put it in the oven, closed it, but the system doesn't recognize "roast" as a verb. The recipe says to "roast the white tuna", but maybe the correct command is to use the oven's function. Since the oven is closed, maybe the next step is to leave it there and let it roast. But the game might require an explicit command. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the stove instead. Wait, the recipe says "roast", which usually requires an oven. The user has the oven open and the tuna inside. Maybe the correct action is to wait for it to roast, but the game might not have a "wait" command. Alternatively, the user might need to use the stove to roast it. But the stove is not heated. The user previously tried to heat the stove. Maybe the correct command is to "put white tuna in oven" again, but that's already done. The system is not recognizing "roast", so perhaps the next step is to close the oven and assume it's roasting. But the user already closed it. Maybe the game expects the user to just leave it and proceed to the next step. Since the recipe's next step is "prepare meal", maybe the user needs to combine the fried pepper and roasted tuna. The correct command would be "prepare meal" or "combine ingredients". But the system might not recognize that. Alternatively, the user needs to check the oven for the roasted tuna. But the oven is closed. Maybe the next action is to open the oven again to take the tuna out. But the user already did that. This is confusing. The user needs to follow the recipe steps, so after roasting, they should prepare the meal. The correct command might be "prepare meal" or "make meal". But the system might not recognize that. Alternatively, the user needs to use the stove to finish cooking. But the stove is empty. Maybe the correct command is "eat the meal" once everything is cooked. But the user hasn't eaten it yet. The user is stuck on the roast step. The correct action might be to use the oven's function, but the system doesn't recognize "roast". So the next step is to close the oven and proceed, assuming the tuna is roasted. Then, the user can combine the ingredients. The correct command would be "prepare meal" or "combine ingredients".

Okay, the user has put the white tuna on the stove. Now, the next step is to combine the red hot pepper and the white tuna on the stove to prepare the meal. The recipe says to "prepare meal" after cooking the ingredients. The correct command would be "prepare meal" or "combine ingredients". But the system might require a specific action. Since the user has both ingredients on the stove, the next step is to prepare the meal by combining them. The correct command is "prepare meal".
