You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You have walked into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen.

As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a fridge. The fridge contains a raw red tuna, a red onion and a raw white tuna. You can see a closed oven in the room. You can make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You see a counter. You see a raw purple potato on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. But the thing is empty.

-= Kitchen =-
You have walked into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen.

As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a fridge. The fridge contains a raw red tuna, a red onion and a raw white tuna. You can see a closed oven in the room. You can make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You see a counter. You see a raw purple potato on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. But the thing is empty.
