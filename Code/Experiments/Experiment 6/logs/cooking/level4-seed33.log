You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Corridor =-
I am stoked to announce that you are now in the corridor. You begin looking for stuff.



You need an exit without a door? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one. There is an exit to the west.

You find yourself in a bathroom. A standard one. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You make out a toilet. But the thing is empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the toilet.

You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.

-= Bedroom =-
You arrive in a bedroom. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a bed. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. A normal one.

You can make out a fridge. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. The fridge contains a carrot and a block of cheese. A closed oven is in the room. You can see a table. On the table you make out a knife. You see a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato and a cookbook. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is an open frosted-glass door leading east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.
