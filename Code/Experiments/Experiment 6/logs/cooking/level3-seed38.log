-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. An ordinary one. You can barely contain your excitement.

Hey, want to see a fridge? Look over there, a fridge. The fridge contains a white onion, a yellow bell pepper, a green bell pepper, a raw white tuna, a yellow onion, an orange bell pepper and a block of cheese. You can see a closed conventional looking oven here. You make out a table. Now why would someone leave that there? On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. On the counter you see a red apple, a yellow apple, a red hot pepper, a green apple and a raw yellow potato. You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.

You arrive in a kitchen. An ordinary one. You can barely contain your excitement.

Hey, want to see a fridge? Look over there, a fridge. The fridge contains a white onion, a yellow bell pepper, a green bell pepper, a raw white tuna, a yellow onion, an orange bell pepper and a block of cheese. You can see a closed conventional looking oven here. You make out a table. Now why would someone leave that there? On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. On the counter you see a red apple, a yellow apple, a red hot pepper, a green apple and a raw yellow potato. You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.
