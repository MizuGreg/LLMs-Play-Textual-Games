-= Bathroom =-
You've just walked into a bathroom.

You make out a toilet. The toilet is white. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the toilet.

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door.

Look around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen.

You see a closed fridge in the room. You can make out an oven. You smell an intriguing smell, and follow it to a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a banana, a raw purple potato, a green apple and a green hot pepper. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.

There is a closed frosted-glass door leading east. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what the next step should be. The user is in a kitchen game, and their goal is to cook a delicious meal using the cookbook. So far, they've taken the cookbook, a yellow bell pepper from the fridge, a raw purple potato from the counter, and a green hot pepper from the counter. Each item they take increases their score, so they're probably on the right track.

Now, the next logical step would be to use the cookbook to find a recipe. The cookbook is on the table, and they've already taken it. The ingredients they've collected so far include a yellow bell pepper, a purple potato, and a green hot pepper. Maybe they need to look at the cookbook to see which recipe uses these ingredients. 

The user's last action was taking the green hot pepper, and the next command should be to open the cookbook. Wait, but they already took the cookbook from the table. So maybe they need to check the cookbook's contents. However, in the game, the command might be to "open" the cookbook. But in the previous steps, when they took the cookbook, they didn't open it yet. So the next action should be to open the cookbook to see the recipe. 

Alternatively, maybe they need to use the ingredients they've collected to start cooking. But since the game is about following a recipe from the cookbook, the correct step is to open the cookbook to find the recipe. The user has the cookbook in their inventory now, so the next command should be to open it. That way, they can check the recipe and proceed with the cooking steps.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the recipe from the cookbook. They've collected the banana, lettuce, and yellow bell pepper. The next step in the recipe is to "dice the banana." But in the game, they need to use the knife to dice it. Earlier, they tried "use knife" but it didn't work. Then they tried "use knife on banana," which also didn't work. Now, the game is asking what they want to dice the banana with.

Wait, maybe the correct command is to use the knife on the banana. But the user tried "use knife on banana" and got an error. Alternatively, maybe they need to first use the knife on the banana. Let me check the previous steps. The user has the knife on the table. So the correct action would be to use the knife on the banana to dice it. The game might be expecting the command "dice banana with knife" or something similar. But the system only allows certain commands. Since the user tried "use knife on banana" and it didn't work, maybe the correct command is "dice banana" followed by using the knife. But the game might require the user to specify the tool. Alternatively, maybe the knife is already in hand, so the command is "dice banana." But the game says "What do you want to dice the banana with?" So the user needs to specify the tool. The knife is available, so the correct command would be "use knife on banana." But that didn't work before. Maybe the correct syntax is "dice banana with knife." But the game might not recognize that. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to first take the knife. Wait, the knife is on the table. The user hasn't taken it yet. So maybe they need to take the knife first. Let me check the inventory. The user has the cookbook, banana, lettuce, and yellow bell pepper. The knife is on the table. So the steps would be: take knife, then use it on the banana. But the user hasn't taken the knife yet. So the next action should be to take the knife. Then, use it on the banana. But the user is at the step where they need to dice the banana. So the correct sequence is take knife, then use knife on banana. But the user is currently at the step where they need to dice the banana, and the game is prompting for the tool. So the correct answer is to use the knife on the banana. But the previous attempt didn't work. Maybe the correct command is "use knife on banana." But the game says that's not a recognized verb. Alternatively, maybe the command is "cut banana with knife." But the game might expect "dice" as the verb. So the user needs to use the knife to dice the banana. The correct command would be "dice banana with knife." But the game might not accept that. Alternatively, the user might need to first take the knife. So the next action is to take the knife. Then, use it on the banana. But the user is currently at the step where they need to dice the banana. So the correct next action is to take the knife first. Therefore, the answer is "take knife."

Okay, the user is trying to dice the banana using the knife. They've tried several commands like "use knife on banana" and "use knife to dice banana", but the game keeps saying "That's not a verb I recognise." Hmm, maybe the correct command is simpler. Let me think about the possible commands in the game. The user has the knife and the banana. The recipe says "dice the banana". Maybe the correct command is just "dice banana" without specifying the tool, assuming the knife is already in use. Alternatively, maybe the game expects "cut banana" instead of "dice". But the recipe says "dice", so maybe "dice banana" is the right verb. Let me check previous steps. The user took the knife, so perhaps the game expects "cut banana with knife" but that's not working. Wait, maybe the correct command is "cut banana" since "dice" isn't recognized. Or maybe "chop banana". But the recipe says "dice". Alternatively, maybe the game uses "cut" as the verb. Let me try "cut banana" next. If that doesn't work, maybe "chop banana". But the user needs to follow the recipe's directions. The recipe says "dice the banana", so maybe the correct command is "dice banana" even if the game says it's not a verb. Alternatively, maybe the game expects "use knife to dice banana" but that's not working. Wait, the user already took the knife, so maybe the command is "dice banana" without mentioning the knife. Let me try that.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, the user is stuck on the "fry banana" command. They've tried multiple variations, but the game keeps rejecting them. Let me think about possible commands again. The recipe says "fry the banana", so maybe the correct verb is "fry" without specifying the pan. But the game says it's not a recognized verb. Maybe the game expects a different verb like "cook" or "heat". Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the stove. The stove is in the kitchen. So perhaps the correct command is "fry banana on stove". But the game might not recognize that. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to first take the pan. Wait, the user hasn't taken the pan yet. The recipe doesn't mention a pan, but the stove is conventional. Maybe the correct command is "fry banana on stove". Let me try that.
