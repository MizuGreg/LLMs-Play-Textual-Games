You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Bedroom =-
I am excited to announce that you are now in the bedroom. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a bed. The bed appears to be empty.

You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.

On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is an open plain door leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

Well how about that, you are in a place we're calling a livingroom. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You can see a sofa. The sofa is comfy. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.
