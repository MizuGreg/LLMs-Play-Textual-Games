SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe in the cookbook. The recipe requires dice the block of cheese, fry the block of cheese, dice the green bell pepper, roast the green bell pepper, slice the yellow onion, roast the yellow onion, and prepare the meal.

So far, the user has tried to dice the block of cheese, but couldn't see it. Then they looked at the red hot pepper, which they didn't want to eat. Then they looked at the raw purple potato, which looked tasty. Then they tried to slice the yellow onion, but couldn't see it.

Wait, the ingredients listed in the recipe are block of cheese, green bell pepper, and yellow onion. The user has the red hot pepper and raw purple potato in the kitchen, but those aren't part of the recipe. The recipe's ingredients are cheese, green bell pepper, and yellow onion. So maybe the user needs to find those three items.

But in the kitchen, the user sees a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato, a cookbook, a knife, a fridge, an oven, a table, and a counter. The block of cheese isn't mentioned here. Wait, maybe the block of cheese is in the fridge? The user hasn't checked the fridge yet. The recipe says "block of cheese," but in the kitchen description, there's no cheese mentioned. The user has a knife, so maybe they can use that to dice the cheese once they find it.

So the user needs to check the fridge for the block of cheese. The fridge is a closed frosted-glass door leading south. The user is in the kitchen, and the fridge is to the south. So the next step should be to go south to the fridge, open it, and find the block of cheese. Then, they can dice it as per the recipe.

But the user hasn't tried going south yet. The current location is the kitchen, and the exit to the south is the fridge. So the next action should be to go south to the fridge, open it, and get the block of cheese. Then, they can proceed with dicing it. The user might have missed checking the fridge earlier. So the correct next step is to go south to the fridge.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the recipe from the cookbook. The recipe says to "dice the block of cheese" as the first step. The user has the block of cheese in hand now. The problem is that they need to dice it, but the game is asking what they want to use to dice it.

Earlier, the user had a knife in the kitchen. The knife was on the counter, but the user didn't pick it up yet. Wait, in the kitchen description, there's a knife on the counter. So maybe the user needs to take the knife first, then use it to dice the cheese.

But in the current state, the user has the block of cheese. The previous action was taking the cheese from the fridge. Now, they need to use the knife to dice it. The game is prompting for the tool to use. Since the knife is available, the user should use it. But the user hasn't picked up the knife yet. So the correct sequence is: take the knife, then use it to dice the cheese.

But the game might require the user to first take the knife. Let me check the previous steps. The user was in the kitchen, and the knife was on the counter. The user hasn't taken it yet. So the next step should be to take the knife, then use it to dice the cheese. However, the game might not allow using the knife unless it's picked up. So the user needs to take the knife first.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the recipe steps. They've already diced the block of cheese. The next step in the recipe is to "fry the block of cheese." But the user is having trouble finding the right command. The previous attempts used verbs like "fry" with different objects and prepositions, but the game isn't recognizing them.

Maybe the correct command is simply "fry block of cheese" without specifying the tool or pan. The recipe says "fry the block of cheese," so the action is just frying it. The user might need to use the stove, which is in the kitchen. Since the user is already in the kitchen and has the cheese, the next step is to fry it. The game might expect the command "fry block of cheese" as the verb. Let's try that.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the recipe steps. They've already diced the block of cheese. The next step in the recipe is to "fry the block of cheese." But the user is having trouble finding the right command. The previous attempts used verbs like "fry" with different objects and prepositions, but the game isn't recognizing them.

Maybe the correct command is simply "fry block of cheese" without specifying the tool or pan. The recipe says "fry the block of cheese," so the action is just frying it. The user might need to use the stove, which is in the kitchen. Since the user is already in the kitchen and has the cheese, the next step is to fry it. The game might expect the command "fry block of cheese" as the verb. Let's try that.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the recipe steps. They've already diced the block of cheese. The next step in the recipe is to "fry the block of cheese." But the user is having trouble finding the right command. The previous attempts used verbs like "fry" with different objects and prepositions, but the game isn't recognizing them.

Maybe the correct command is simply "fry block of cheese" without specifying the tool or pan. The recipe says "fry the block of cheese," so the action is just frying it. The user might need to use the stove, which is in the kitchen. Since the user is already in the kitchen and has the cheese, the next step is to fry it. The game might expect the command "fry block of cheese" as the verb. Let's try that.
