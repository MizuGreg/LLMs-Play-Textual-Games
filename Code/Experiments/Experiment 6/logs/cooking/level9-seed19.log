You arrive in a corridor. A normal kind of place. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.



There is an exit to the east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. An ordinary one. You begin looking for stuff.

As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a fridge. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! The fridge is empty, what a horrible day! You see an oven. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can make out a table. The table is massive. However, the table, like an empty table, has nothing on it. You make out a counter. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a counter? The counter is vast. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You can make out a stove. But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is a closed sliding patio door leading south. There is a closed plain door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one.
