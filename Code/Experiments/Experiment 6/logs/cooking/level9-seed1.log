You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

Well, here we are in the kitchen. Let's see what's in here.

What's that over there? It looks like it's a fridge. You see a closed oven right there by you. You can make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. Look over there! a counter. On the counter you make out a raw red potato, a red apple, a raw purple potato and a knife. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. But the thing is empty.

There is a closed frosted-glass door leading west. There is an exit to the east. There is an exit to the south.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe in the cookbook. The recipe requires red bell pepper, red potato, and yellow bell pepper. But in the kitchen, the user found a raw red potato, a red apple, a raw purple potato, and a knife. The table has a cookbook, but no other ingredients mentioned.

Wait, the user checked the table multiple times and only found the cookbook. The fridge and oven are closed, and the stove is empty. The ingredients needed for the recipe aren't present. The red apple and purple potato might not be the ones needed. The recipe specifies red bell pepper and yellow bell pepper, which aren't listed in the kitchen's current items. So the user might be missing the necessary ingredients. Since the table is undependable, maybe the ingredients are elsewhere, like in the fridge? But the fridge is closed. The user needs to open it to check. Alternatively, maybe the ingredients are in the pantry or another location. But the current environment only mentions the kitchen with the fridge, oven, table, counter, and stove. The user hasn't checked the fridge yet. So the next logical step is to open the fridge to see if the missing ingredients are inside. That makes sense because the recipe requires those specific vegetables, and they're not on the table. So the action should be to open the fridge.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal based on the recipe from the cookbook. The recipe requires red bell pepper, red potato, and yellow bell pepper. Earlier, the user checked the table and the fridge. The table had a cookbook, a raw red potato, a red apple, a raw purple potato, and a knife. The fridge had yellow bell pepper, yellow onion, green bell pepper, and raw red tuna.

Wait, the recipe needs a red bell pepper and yellow bell pepper. The fridge has a yellow bell pepper, but not a red one. The table has a red potato but not a red bell pepper. The user might need to find a red bell pepper somewhere else. But the current inventory in the kitchen doesn't show a red bell pepper. The fridge has a green bell pepper and yellow bell pepper. Maybe the user needs to look elsewhere, but the kitchen is the only place mentioned. Alternatively, maybe the red bell pepper is in the fridge but was missed. But according to the latest check, the fridge has yellow and green bell peppers, not red. The red potato is on the table. So the missing ingredient is the red bell pepper. But where is it? The user hasn't checked other areas. The kitchen's fridge is open, but maybe the red bell pepper is inside but not listed? Or perhaps the user needs to look in the pantry or another location. However, the current environment only mentions the kitchen with the fridge, oven, table, counter, and stove. Since the fridge is open and the user checked it, maybe the red bell pepper isn't present. Then the user can't proceed with the recipe. But the user is supposed to cook the meal, so maybe they need to use available ingredients. Alternatively, maybe the red bell pepper is a typo and the recipe actually needs a yellow bell pepper, which is available. But the recipe specifies red. Hmm. The user might need to check the counter again. The counter has a raw red potato, red apple, purple potato, and a knife. No bell peppers there. So the user is missing the red bell pepper. Since the fridge doesn't have it, maybe the user can't complete the recipe. But the game might expect the user to proceed with available ingredients. Alternatively, maybe the red bell pepper is in the fridge but wasn't listed. Wait, the user checked the fridge and saw yellow and green bell peppers. So the red bell pepper isn't there. Therefore, the user can't complete the recipe. But the goal is to cook the meal, so maybe the user needs to find another way. Alternatively, maybe the user can use the yellow bell pepper instead of the red one, but the recipe specifies red. This is confusing. The user might need to check other locations, but the kitchen is the only place. Maybe the user should try to use the available ingredients even if they don't match the recipe. But the recipe's directions require specific steps. The user is stuck because the red bell pepper is missing. So the next action should be to check the fridge again, but that's already been done. Alternatively, maybe the user should look for the red bell pepper elsewhere, but the environment doesn't mention other places. So perhaps the user can't proceed and needs to find another way. But the game might have a trick. Wait, the user has a raw red potato. Maybe the recipe's "red potato" is the same as the raw red potato on the table. The recipe also needs a red bell pepper, which is missing. The user might need to find a red bell pepper. But where? The fridge has yellow and green. Maybe the user can't complete the recipe and needs to look elsewhere. But the game's environment doesn't mention other locations. So the user is stuck. However, the user might have to proceed with the available ingredients. The user has a yellow bell pepper in the fridge. Maybe the recipe's "red bell pepper" is a mistake, and the user can use the yellow one. But that's speculation. Alternatively, the user might need to check the oven or stove. The oven is closed. Maybe the user can open it. So the next action should be to open the oven to check if the red bell pepper is inside. That's a possible step.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's recap. The user is trying to cook a meal based on a recipe that requires red bell pepper, red potato, and yellow bell pepper. So far, in the kitchen, they found a raw red potato on the table, and in the fridge, they found a yellow bell pepper, yellow onion, green bell pepper, and raw red tuna. The oven is empty.

The user has been checking the fridge and oven, but the red bell pepper is missing. The recipe needs a red bell pepper, but the available ingredients don't include it. The user might be stuck because they can't find the required ingredient. The oven is empty, so maybe there's no way to get the red bell pepper from there. The fridge has a yellow bell pepper, but the recipe specifies red. Maybe the user needs to look elsewhere, but the kitchen is the only place mentioned. Alternatively, maybe the red bell pepper is in the fridge but wasn't listed, but the user checked and it wasn't there. So the user can't proceed with the recipe as it stands. The next step might be to check other areas, but the environment doesn't mention any other locations. The user might have to use the available ingredients even if they don't match the recipe, but the recipe's directions are specific. Since the user can't find the red bell pepper, they can't complete the meal. Maybe the game expects them to proceed despite the missing ingredient, but that's unclear. The user might need to check the counter again, but the counter has the raw red potato and other items. The red potato is there, but not the bell pepper. So the user is stuck. The next action should be to check the counter again, but the user has already done that. Alternatively, maybe the user should try to use the yellow bell pepper instead of the red one, even though the recipe says red. But that's a guess. The user might need to proceed with the available ingredients, even if it's not perfect. So the next action could be to start cooking with the available items, even if they don't match the recipe. But the recipe's steps require specific ingredients. The user might have to proceed anyway. So the next step is to follow the recipe's directions with the available ingredients, even if they're not exactly matching. The user has the red potato and yellow bell pepper. Maybe the recipe's "red bell pepper" is a mistake, and the user can use the yellow one. Alternatively, the user might need to find another way. But given the current situation, the user has to proceed with what's available. So the next action is to start preparing the meal with the available ingredients.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal based on a recipe that requires red bell pepper, red potato, and yellow bell pepper. So far, they've checked the fridge and found a yellow bell pepper, but no red one. The table has a raw red potato, but not the bell pepper. The oven is empty. The counter has a raw red potato, apple, purple potato, and a knife. The user has been checking various places but can't find the red bell pepper.

The recipe's ingredients are missing the red bell pepper. The user might be stuck because that's the only missing item. The oven is empty, so maybe there's no way to get the red bell pepper from there. The fridge has a yellow bell pepper, but the recipe specifies red. Maybe the user needs to proceed with the available ingredients even if they don't match the recipe. Alternatively, maybe the red bell pepper is in the fridge but wasn't listed, but the user checked and it wasn't there. 

The user has to follow the recipe's directions: slice the red bell pepper, roast it, dice the red potato, roast it, chop the yellow bell pepper, fry it, and prepare the meal. Since the red bell pepper isn't available, the user can't complete the steps. But maybe the game expects them to use the yellow bell pepper instead. However, the recipe specifically says red. 

The user might need to check other areas, but the kitchen is the only place mentioned. The oven is empty, so no help there. The counter has the red potato, but not the bell pepper. The fridge has the yellow bell pepper. Maybe the user has to proceed with the yellow one, even though the recipe says red. That's a possible workaround. 

Alternatively, the user might have to look for the red bell pepper elsewhere, but the environment doesn't mention other locations. So the next step is to use the available yellow bell pepper instead of the red one, even though the recipe says red. That's the only way to proceed. So the next action would be to start preparing the meal with the available ingredients, even if they don't match the recipe.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, the user is trying to cook a meal based on a recipe that requires red bell pepper, red potato, and yellow bell pepper. They've checked the fridge and found a yellow bell pepper, but no red one. The table has a raw red potato. The user is stuck because the red bell pepper is missing.

The user has been trying to substitute the yellow bell pepper for the red one, but the game doesn't recognize those commands. The previous attempts to use the yellow bell pepper as a substitute are failing because the game expects a verb. The user needs to follow the recipe's steps: slice the red bell pepper, roast it, dice the red potato, roast it, chop the yellow bell pepper, fry it, and prepare the meal.

Since the red bell pepper isn't available, maybe the user needs to proceed with the available ingredients. The yellow bell pepper is in the fridge. The user should check if they can use it instead of the red one. The game might accept "use the yellow bell pepper" as a command, but the user has tried that and it's not working. Alternatively, the user might need to use the yellow bell pepper in the steps where the red one is required. The recipe's directions are specific, but maybe the game allows flexibility. The user needs to find a way to proceed with the available ingredients. The next step is to use the yellow bell pepper in place of the red one, even if the game doesn't recognize the command. The user might have to try a different phrasing or command.
