You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. An ordinary one. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."

Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a fridge. The fridge contains a carrot. Is this it? Is this what you came to TextWorld to see? a fridge? You make out an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. You shudder, but continue examining the table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a raw yellow potato, a yellow apple, a raw red potato, a red hot pepper and a red apple. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. You move on, clearly upset with TextWorld.
