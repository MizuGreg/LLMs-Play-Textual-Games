You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

You've entered a kitchen.

Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a fridge. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. The fridge contains a red onion, a raw red potato, a white onion, a green bell pepper and an orange bell pepper. You check the price tag on the fridge. 80 bucks? What a deal! You'll have to ask where they got this! You can make out a closed oven nearby. You see a table. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a cookbook and a knife. You scan the room, seeing a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The stove appears to be empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

Okay, let's see. The user is in a kitchen game where they need to cook a meal. The cookbook says to use a red onion, chop it, fry it, and prepare the meal. So far, they looked at the cookbook and saw the recipe. The next step would be to get the red onion from the fridge. The fridge has a red onion listed. So the user should take the red onion. Then, they need to chop it. But first, they need to pick up the onion. The command would be "take red onion". Then, after taking it, they can chop it. But the user hasn't taken the onion yet. So the next action should be to take the red onion from the fridge.

Okay, the user is in a text-based cooking game. They've taken the red onion from the fridge and now need to chop it. The game prompt asks what they want to chop the onion with. In a kitchen, typical tools for chopping are a knife, a spoon, or maybe a fork. But since the user has a knife on the counter (from the initial description), the logical tool would be the knife.

The user's previous action was "chop the red onion," but the game responded with a question about the tool. So the next step is to specify the tool. The knife is the most appropriate here. So the command should be "use knife" or "chop with knife." But in the game's context, maybe "chop with knife" is the correct syntax. Alternatively, since the user already has the onion, they need to specify the tool. The game might expect "use knife" or "chop with knife." Let me check the previous interactions. The user said "chop the red onion," and the game asked for the tool. So the next action should be to use the knife. Therefore, the correct command is "use knife" or "chop with knife." But in the game's context, maybe "chop with knife" is the right command. Alternatively, the game might require "use knife" to chop. But the user has the onion in hand, so the action would be to chop it with the knife. So the next command is "chop with knife."

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to chop the red onion but keeps getting errors. The previous attempts were "chop the red onion" which led to a question about the tool, then "chop with knife" which didn't work. Now, after trying "use knife", the game said that's not a recognized verb.

Hmm, maybe the correct command is to use the knife on the onion. But in TextWorld, commands are usually verbs. So instead of "use knife", maybe "cut onion with knife" or "chop onion". But the game might expect a specific syntax. The user has the onion in hand, so perhaps "chop onion" without specifying the tool, but the game previously asked for the tool. Alternatively, maybe the knife is already in hand, so the command is just "chop onion". Let me think. The user took the onion, so the next step is to chop it. The game might accept "chop onion" as the command. Let me try that.

Okay, the user is stuck again. They tried "chop onion" but the game still asks for the tool. Maybe the correct command is to specify the knife. Since the knife is on the counter, maybe they need to pick it up first. Wait, the user already took the onion. Maybe the knife is needed to chop. So the steps are: take the onion, take the knife, then chop the onion with the knife. But the user hasn't taken the knife yet. Let me check the initial description. The counter has a cookbook and a knife. So the user needs to take the knife. Then, chop the onion with it. So the next command should be "take knife" then "chop onion with knife". But the game might require "use knife" or "chop with knife". Alternatively, maybe "cut onion with knife". But the user's previous attempt was "chop with knife" which didn't work. Maybe the correct command is "use knife on onion" or "chop onion". But the game is strict with verbs. Maybe "cut onion" is the correct verb. Let me try "cut onion".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to chop the red onion but keeps getting errors. The game keeps asking for the tool or the correct verb. Previous attempts include "chop the red onion", "chop with knife", "use knife", "chop onion", "cut onion", and "chop the red onion" again. Each time, the game responds with errors or prompts for more info.

Hmm, maybe the correct command is to use the knife on the onion. Since the knife is on the counter, the user needs to take it first. Wait, the user already took the onion. So maybe the steps are: take the knife, then chop the onion with the knife. But the user hasn't taken the knife yet. Let me check the initial description again.

Maybe the correct verb is "slice" or "dice" as the game mentioned earlier. The game said "Either slice, dice, or chop it." So maybe the user needs to choose one of those verbs.

Okay, the user is in a kitchen game where they need to cook a meal. They've been trying to chop the red onion but keep getting errors. The game's response after looking around again shows the fridge, oven, table, counter with a cookbook and knife, and an empty stove. The user needs to follow the recipe from the cookbook, which requires chopping the red onion, frying it, and preparing the meal.

Earlier attempts to chop the onion resulted in errors, so the user might need to use the knife properly. The knife is on the counter, so maybe they need to take it first. The user already took the red onion from the fridge, so the next step is to take the knife. Then, use the knife to chop the onion. The game might require the command "take knife" followed by "chop onion with knife" or similar. But the user's previous attempts didn't work, so maybe the correct command is "use knife on onion" or "chop onion". However, the game might expect "cut onion" or "slice onion". But the user tried "slice" and "dice" and got errors. Maybe the correct verb is "chop" without specifying the tool, but the game requires the tool.

Okay, the user is stuck again. They've tried several commands like "fry onion", "cook onion", "heat stove", "heat pan", and "put onion in pan", but none worked. The game requires the correct verbs.

Maybe the correct action is to "place the onion on the stove" or "put the onion on the stove". But the game might expect "put onion on stove" without the article. Alternatively, "stove" is the object, so "put onion on stove". Let me try that.

Okay, the user is trying to put the onion on the stove but gets an error. They've already chopped the onion and taken the knife. The stove is in the kitchen. Maybe the correct command is "put onion in stove" or "place onion in stove". The game might require "stove" as the object. Let me try "put onion in stove".
