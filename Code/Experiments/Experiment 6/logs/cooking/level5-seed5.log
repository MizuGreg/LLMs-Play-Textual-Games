You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Bathroom =-
Well, here we are in a bathroom.

You can make out a toilet. The toilet is white. The toilet appears to be empty.

There is an exit to the north.

You've just sauntered into a corridor.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one. There is an exit to the south.

GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. An usual one. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, a yellow apple and an orange bell pepper. You see an oven. You smell a pungent smell, and follow it to a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. What's that over there? It looks like it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a banana, a raw yellow potato and a green apple. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty.

There is an open frosted-glass door leading east. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the recipe from the cookbook. The recipe says to "dice the banana" and "fry the banana", then "dice the yellow bell pepper" and "roast the yellow bell pepper". 

First, the user tried to "dice the banana", but the game responded that cutting requires a knife. They took the knife from the table. Then they tried "dice the banana" again, but the game still said cutting requires a knife. Then they tried "use knife on banana", which wasn't a recognized verb.

Hmm, maybe the correct action is to use the knife on the banana to dice it. But the game didn't recognize "use knife on banana" as a valid command. Maybe the correct syntax is different. Perhaps it's "cut banana with knife" or "dice banana with knife". Alternatively, maybe after taking the knife, the user needs to "cut the banana" instead of "dice".

Wait, the recipe says "dice the banana", so maybe the correct command is "dice banana". But earlier, when the user tried "dice the banana", the game said cutting requires a knife. So maybe the user needs to use the knife first. But the user already took the knife. So perhaps the next step is to "cut the banana" with the knife. But the game might expect a specific command.

Alternatively, maybe the user should "fry the banana" after dicing it. But the user is stuck on dicing. Since the game didn't accept "use knife on banana", maybe the correct command is "cut banana" without specifying the knife, assuming the knife is in hand. Or maybe "slice banana" instead of "dice".

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "put knife on banana" to start cutting. But the game's responses are a bit unclear. The user has to follow the recipe steps, so maybe the next action is to "dice the banana" again, hoping that the game accepts it now that the knife is in hand. But the game's previous response said that cutting requires a knife, so maybe the user needs to use the knife first. But the user already took the knife. Maybe the correct command is "cut banana with knife", but the game might not recognize that.

Alternatively, maybe the user should try "fry the banana" next, but that's part of the directions after dicing. Since the user is stuck on dicing, perhaps the correct action is to "cut banana" again, even though the game said cutting requires a knife. Maybe the game's message is a hint that the knife is needed, and the user has it. So the next step is to "cut banana" or "dice banana" again.

Maybe the game wants "cut banana" instead of "dice", or "slice banana". Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "put knife on banana" to start cutting. But the game's responses are confusing. The user is close to completing the recipe, so the next step should be to proceed with the next part of the recipe, even if they're stuck on dicing. Maybe after dicing, they can fry it. But since they can't dice, maybe they should try frying instead, but the recipe says to dice first. Alternatively, maybe the user should try "fry banana" even if it's not diced, but that's not according to the recipe. The user needs to follow the steps exactly. So the next action should be to dice the banana again, even though the game is prompting about the knife. Maybe the game is expecting "cut banana" without the knife mention. Let's try "cut banana".

Okay, the user is having trouble getting the game to recognize their commands. They've tried several actions like "dice banana", "cut banana", "slice banana", and "use knife on banana", but the game isn't responding correctly. The recipe requires dicing the banana and frying it, but the user is stuck on the first step.

The game's responses are confusing. It says "Cutting something requires a knife" even though the user has the knife. Maybe the game expects a specific verb or syntax. Since the user has the knife, perhaps they need to use it directly on the banana. But previous attempts to "use knife on banana" didn't work.

Alternatively, maybe the game is expecting the user to first "cut" the banana with the knife, then proceed to fry it. The user might need to try a different command structure, like "cut banana with knife" or "slice banana with knife". However, the game's error messages suggest that the commands are not being recognized properly.

Given the repeated failures, the user might need to try a different approach. Perhaps the game is expecting the user to "fry the banana" after dicing it, but since they can't dice it, they're stuck. Alternatively, maybe the user should proceed to the next step in the recipe, even if they haven't diced the banana yet. But according to the recipe, dicing is required first.

The user is close to the goal, but the game's command recognition is causing obstacles. The next step should be to try a different command that the game might recognize, even if it's not perfect. Maybe "cut banana" again, or "use knife on banana" despite the previous error.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, the user is having trouble getting the game to recognize their commands. They've tried several actions like "dice banana", "cut banana", "slice banana", and "use knife on banana", but the game isn't responding correctly. The recipe requires dicing the banana and frying it, but the user is stuck on the first step.

The game's responses are confusing. It says "Cutting something requires a knife" even though the user has the knife. Maybe the game expects a specific verb or syntax. Since the user has the knife, perhaps they need to use it directly on the banana. But previous attempts to "use knife on banana" didn't work.

Alternatively, maybe the game is expecting the user to first "cut" the banana with the knife, then proceed to fry it. The user might need to try a different command structure, like "cut banana with knife" or "slice banana with knife". However, the game's error messages suggest that the commands are not being recognized properly.

Given the repeated failures, the user might need to try a different approach. Perhaps the game is expecting the user to "fry the banana" after dicing it, but since they can't dice it, they're stuck. Alternatively, maybe the user should proceed to the next step in the recipe, even if they haven't diced the banana yet. But according to the recipe, dicing is required first.

The user is close to the goal, but the game's command recognition is causing obstacles. The next step should be to try a different command that the game might recognize, even if it's not perfect. Maybe "cut banana" again, or "use knife on banana" despite the previous error.

You need to specify how you want to cut the banana. Either slice, dice, or chop it.

Given the repeated failures, the user might need to try a different approach. Perhaps the game is expecting the user to "fry the banana" after dicing it, but since they can't dice it, they're stuck. Alternatively, maybe the user should proceed to the next step in the recipe, even if they haven't diced the banana yet. But according to the recipe, dicing is required first.

The user is close to the goal, but the game's command recognition is causing obstacles. The next step should be to try a different command that the game might recognize, even if it's not perfect. Maybe "cut banana" again, or "use knife on banana" despite the previous error.
