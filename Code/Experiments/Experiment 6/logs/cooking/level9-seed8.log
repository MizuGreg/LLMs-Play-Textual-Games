You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Backyard =-
You find yourself in a backyard. A typical one. You start to take note of what's in the room.

Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a patio chair. But the thing is empty. You can make out a patio table. The patio table is stylish. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You make out a BBQ.

There is a closed sliding patio door leading north. There is a closed barn door leading west. There is an exit to the south.

-= Kitchen =-
Okay, so you're in a kitchen, cool, but is it standard? You better believe it is.

A closed fridge, which looks conventional, is close by. You make out a closed oven. You see a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a yellow apple, a yellow bell pepper and a red apple, so there's that. You can make out a stove. But the thing is empty.

There is a closed plain door leading east. There is an open sliding patio door leading south. There is an exit to the north. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You need an exit without a door? You should try going north.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they need to cook a meal using the cookbook found in the kitchen. So far, they've navigated through the backyard, opened the patio door, entered the kitchen, looked at the cookbook, and took it. The next step is to use the cookbook's recipe to gather ingredients and follow the directions.

The recipe requires carrot, red potato, and yellow apple. The user needs to collect these ingredients. In the kitchen, there's a fridge, oven, stove, and the counter has a yellow apple, a yellow bell pepper, and a red apple. Wait, the ingredients need a red potato and a carrot. The counter has a red apple, but not a potato. The fridge is closed, so maybe they need to open it to find the red potato and carrot. The yellow bell pepper is there, but that's not an ingredient. So the user should check the fridge for the red potato and carrot. Then, follow the directions: chop the carrot, fry it, slice the red potato, grill it, chop the yellow apple, roast it, and prepare the meal. The next action should be to open the fridge to get the ingredients. But the user already took the cookbook, so the next step is to gather the ingredients. So the correct command is to open the fridge.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to take a carrot and a red potato from the fridge, but they can't see them. The fridge is open, but maybe the items are inside but not visible? Or maybe the user needs to check the fridge's contents more carefully.

Earlier, when the user looked at the fridge, it was described as open. But when they tried to take the carrot and red potato, it didn't work. Maybe the items are inside the fridge but not immediately visible. The user might need to check the fridge again or maybe there's a different way to interact with it. Alternatively, perhaps the fridge is empty, but that doesn't make sense because the recipe requires those ingredients.

Wait, in the initial description of the kitchen, the counter has a yellow apple, a yellow bell pepper, and a red apple. The fridge is closed, but when the user opened it, they couldn't see the carrot or red potato. Maybe the fridge doesn't have those items. But the recipe says to use carrot, red potato, and yellow apple. The user already has the yellow apple on the counter. So maybe the carrot and red potato are not in the fridge. That would be a problem because the recipe requires them. But where are they?

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to look elsewhere. The stove is in the kitchen, but that's for cooking. The oven is closed. The table has the cookbook and a knife. The user took the cookbook. Maybe the ingredients are on the counter? But the counter has a yellow apple, yellow bell pepper, and red apple. No carrot or potato. So maybe the fridge doesn't have them, which would mean the user can't complete the recipe. But that's a dead end. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to find the ingredients elsewhere, but the game's environment doesn't mention other places. Maybe the user is supposed to use the items available, but the recipe requires things not present. That's confusing.

Wait, the user is in the kitchen, and the recipe says to use carrot, red potato, and yellow apple. The user has the yellow apple on the counter. The fridge is open but doesn't have the carrot or red potato. So maybe the user needs to find those items elsewhere. But the game's environment only mentions the counter and the fridge. Maybe the user is supposed to use the red apple as a substitute for the red potato? But that's not specified. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the previous steps.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to look inside the fridge again, but the fridge is already open. The user tried to take the carrot and red potato, but it didn't work. Maybe the correct action is to check the fridge's contents again. But the user already did that. The fridge is open, but the items aren't there. So perhaps the user is stuck. But the original goal is to cook a meal using the recipe. If the ingredients aren't available, the user can't proceed. But the game might have a way to get the ingredients. Maybe the user needs to look for the carrot and red potato in another location. But the game's description doesn't mention other places. The user is in the kitchen, and the only other items are on the counter. So maybe the user is supposed to use the red apple as a substitute for the red potato, even though the recipe says red potato. That's a stretch, but maybe that's the intended path.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the knife from the table to chop the red apple, but that's not part of the recipe. The recipe says to chop the carrot, fry it, slice the red potato, grill it, etc. So the user needs the actual ingredients. Since the fridge doesn't have them, maybe the user is supposed to find them elsewhere. But the game's environment doesn't mention other locations. The user is in the kitchen, and the only other place is the living room, but that's not helpful.

The stove is there, but that's for cooking. The oven is closed. The user might need to check the oven, but it's closed. Maybe the user needs to open the oven to find the ingredients. But that's not part of the recipe. Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to use the red apple as a substitute for the red potato, even though the recipe says red potato. That's a possible mistake in the game's design, but maybe that's the intended path.

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to use the yellow bell pepper as a substitute for the carrot. But the recipe says carrot. This is confusing. The user is stuck because the required ingredients aren't available. But the game's goal is to cook a meal, so the user must have the ingredients. Maybe the user made a mistake in the previous steps. Let me check the game's environment again.

Okay, the user is trying to use the red apple as a substitute for the red potato in the recipe. The game doesn't recognize "use red apple as red potato" as a valid command. The previous attempts to use the red apple as a substitute have failed. The user needs to find a different way to proceed. Since the recipe requires a red potato and the user only has a red apple, maybe the correct action is to use the red apple as the red potato, even though the game doesn't accept that command. Alternatively, the user might need to check if there's another way to get the red potato. But the fridge doesn't have it, and the counter only has a red apple. The user might have to proceed with the red apple, even if it's not a perfect substitute. The next step could be to proceed with the recipe using the red apple, even if it's not the exact ingredient. The game might accept "use red apple" as the action. Alternatively, the user might need to use the knife from the table to chop the red apple, but that's not part of the recipe. The correct command might be "chop red apple" to follow the recipe's steps. But the recipe says to chop the carrot and slice the red potato. Since the user has the red apple, maybe they need to chop it. So the next action could be "chop red apple" to proceed with the recipe.

The user has the red apple on the counter, but the recipe requires a red potato. The fridge is open but doesn't have the potato. The user tried using the knife from the table but couldn't. The next step might be to proceed with the recipe steps even without the exact ingredients. Maybe the game expects the user to use the red apple as the red potato despite the mismatch. The correct command might be to "slice red apple" since that's part of the recipe's directions. Alternatively, the user might need to "roast yellow apple" as part of the recipe. Since the user has the yellow apple on the counter, maybe that's the next step. The recipe says to roast the yellow apple, so the user could try that. The command would be "roast yellow apple".

Okay, the user is stuck in the game because they can't find the required ingredients for the recipe. They have the yellow apple on the counter, but the recipe needs a carrot, red potato, and yellow apple. The fridge is open but doesn't have the carrot or red potato. The user tried using the red apple as a substitute but the game doesn't recognize the commands. The next step might be to check if there's another way to get the ingredients or if the game expects a different action. Since the user has the yellow apple, maybe they should proceed with the steps that involve the yellow apple, like roasting it. But the game doesn't accept "roast" as a verb. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the knife on the yellow apple. The correct command might be "chop yellow apple" or "slice yellow apple". The user tried "chop red apple" but that didn't work. Maybe the game expects "chop yellow apple" instead. Let me try that.

Okay, the user is trying to use the knife on the yellow apple but the game doesn't recognize the command. The previous attempts to chop the red apple or yellow apple failed. The user needs to find a valid command that the game accepts. Since the game requires specific verbs, maybe the correct action is to "slice yellow apple" or "cut yellow apple". The user has the knife from the table, so they need to use it on the yellow apple. The correct command might be "slice yellow apple with knife" or "cut yellow apple".

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

<think>
Okay, the user is trying to roast the yellow apple in the oven but the game doesn't recognize the command. They've already put the apple in the oven. Maybe the correct action is to "turn on oven" or "heat oven". The game might expect a specific verb for activating the oven. Let's try that.

Okay, the user is really stuck here. They've tried multiple commands to roast the yellow apple, but the game doesn't recognize any of them. The oven is open, the apple is in the oven, but the user can't get it to roast. Maybe the game expects a different verb or a specific phrase. Let me think about possible commands. The user has the yellow apple in the oven, so maybe the correct action is to "heat the oven" or "turn on the oven". But earlier attempts didn't work. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "open the oven" again, but it's already open. Wait, the user put the apple in the oven, but maybe they need to "close the oven" to trap the heat. Or perhaps the game expects "roast" without specifying the oven. But the user tried that before. Maybe the correct command is "roast yellow apple" even though it's not recognized. Alternatively, the game might have a different set of verbs. Maybe "cook" instead of "roast". Let me try "cook yellow apple".
