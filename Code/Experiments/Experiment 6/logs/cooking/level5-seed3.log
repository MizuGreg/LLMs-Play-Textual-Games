You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Bathroom =-
You've just sauntered into a bathroom.

If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a toilet. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door.

You can make out a sofa. You shudder, but continue examining the sofa. The sofa is comfy. But the thing is empty.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.

You've just shown up in a kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.

Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a fridge! The fridge contains a raw pork chop! You see an oven. You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a knife. You can see a counter. On the counter you see a raw red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it. You swear loudly.

There is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an exit to the west.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they need to cook a meal using the ingredients found in the kitchen. So far, they've taken the cookbook and the raw red potato. The goal is to follow the cookbook's recipe to make a dish.

Looking at the kitchen items: there's a fridge with a raw pork chop, an oven, a table with a knife, a counter with a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, and a cookbook. The user has already taken the red potato. The next step would be to gather more ingredients needed for the recipe.

The cookbook is essential here. Since the user took it earlier, they need to check the recipe inside. But in the previous step, they tried to open it and were told it wasn't something you could open. Then they took it, so maybe now they can use it. The recipe might list ingredients like pork chop, potatoes, and peppers. The user already has the red potato, so they might need the yellow potato and the pork chop. The red hot pepper is also a key ingredient.

So the next actions would be to take the yellow potato and the pork chop from the fridge. Then, using the knife, they can prepare the ingredients. After that, they can use the oven to cook the dish. The user has to collect all the necessary ingredients first before cooking. The stove is there, but maybe the oven is needed for baking or roasting. The user should proceed to gather all ingredients as per the recipe.

Okay, the user has collected the raw red potato, raw yellow potato, and raw pork chop, along with the red hot pepper. They have the cookbook. The next step is to use the cookbook to follow the recipe. Since the previous attempts to use the cookbook resulted in errors, maybe the correct command is to "open cookbook" again. But the user already took the cookbook. Alternatively, maybe they need to "read recipe" or "check cookbook". But the system might expect a specific command. The user tried "use cookbook" which didn't work, then "use recipe in cookbook" which also didn't work. The correct command might be "open cookbook" to view the recipe. Let me check the previous steps. The user took the cookbook from the counter. So the next action should be to open it. The correct command is "open cookbook".

Okay, the user is trying to follow the recipe from the cookbook. They have the pork chop and the knife. The recipe says to dice the pork chop. The user tried using the knife but got an error. Maybe the knife is already in hand, so they need to specify using it. The correct command might be "dice pork chop with knife" or "cut pork chop with knife". Since the system didn't accept "use knife", perhaps the correct verb is "cut" instead of "dice". Let me check the previous steps. The user tried "dice pork chop" and was prompted for the tool. Since the knife is available, the next step is to use it. The correct command is "cut pork chop with knife".

Okay, the user is stuck on the "cut pork chop with knife" command. They've tried it multiple times, but the system keeps prompting for the action. Maybe the correct command is just "cut pork chop" without specifying the knife, assuming the knife is already in use. Alternatively, the system might require the verb "dice" instead of "cut". Let me check the recipe again. The recipe says "dice the pork chop". The user tried "dice pork chop" but was asked for the tool. Since the knife is available, maybe the correct command is "dice pork chop with knife". But the system didn't accept that. Maybe the correct verb is "cut" instead of "dice". Alternatively, the user might need to use the knife first. Wait, the user has the knife from the table. So perhaps the correct command is "cut pork chop with knife". But the system keeps saying it only understood up to "cut the pork chop". Maybe the correct command is just "cut pork chop" and the knife is assumed. Alternatively, the system might require "use knife on pork chop" but that didn't work. Hmm. The user needs to follow the recipe's instruction to dice the pork chop. The correct command is likely "dice pork chop with knife", but the system isn't accepting it. Maybe the user should try "cut pork chop" without the knife. Let me try that.

You need to specify how you want to cut the pork chop. Either slice, dice, or chop it.

Okay, the user is trying to dice the pork chop using the knife. They've tried several commands like "use knife" and "use knife on pork chop", but the system isn't accepting them. The error messages indicate that the commands are not recognized. The recipe says to "dice the pork chop", so maybe the correct verb is "dice" instead of "cut" or "chop". The user might need to use the knife directly. Since the system didn't accept "use knife to dice pork chop", perhaps the correct command is just "dice pork chop with knife". But the system keeps prompting for the action. Alternatively, the user might need to use the knife first. Wait, the user has the knife from the table. Maybe the correct command is "cut pork chop with knife". But the system says "I only understood you as far as wanting to cut the pork chop".

Okay, the user is stuck in the kitchen, trying to roast the pork chop but can't get the command right. They've tried several verbs like "roast", "use", "put", but the system isn't accepting them. The recipe says to "roast the pork chop", so maybe the correct command is "roast pork chop with oven". But the system says that's not a verb. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the oven first. The available commands include "put ... on ...", so perhaps "put pork chop in oven". But the user has the pork chop in their inventory. Let me check the inventory. The user has the raw red potato, raw yellow potato, raw pork chop, red hot pepper, and the cookbook. So the pork chop is in inventory. The oven is in the kitchen. The correct command might be "put pork chop in oven". But the system might require the verb "roast". Alternatively, the user might need to "use oven on pork chop". But the system says that's not a verb. Maybe the correct command is "roast pork chop". The system says that's not a verb, but maybe it's acceptable. Let me try "roast pork chop".

Okay, the user is trying to roast the pork chop but keeps getting errors. They've opened the oven and put the pork chop inside. The next step is to roast it. The available commands include "roast", but the system says it's not a verb. Maybe the correct command is "use oven to roast pork chop" or "roast pork chop with oven". But the system isn't accepting it. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "close the oven" after putting the pork chop in. Wait, the oven was opened, and the pork chop is inside. The correct action might be to "close the oven" to roast it. Let me check the commands again. The available commands include "close ...". So maybe "close oven" to start roasting. Alternatively, the system might require the verb "roast" without specifying the oven. But the user has the pork chop in the oven. Maybe the correct command is "roast pork chop". The system says that's not a verb, but maybe it's acceptable. Let me try "roast pork chop".

Okay, the user is trying to roast the pork chop in the oven but keeps getting errors. They closed the oven, but the system still doesn't recognize the command. The recipe says to "roast the pork chop", so maybe the correct command is "roast pork chop". The system says that's not a verb, but maybe it's acceptable. Alternatively, the user might need to use the oven's function. Since the oven is closed, maybe the correct command is "use oven to roast pork chop". But the system says that's not a verb. The user has the pork chop in the oven, so maybe the next step is to "wait" for it to roast, but that's not a command. Alternatively, the user might need to "open the oven" again. But the oven is already closed. Hmm. The correct command might be "roast pork chop" even if the system says it's not a verb. Let me try that.

Okay, the user is stuck again. They've tried multiple commands but the system keeps rejecting them. The key is to follow the recipe's directions: dice the pork chop, roast it, slice the red potato, fry it, and prepare the meal. The user has already diced the pork chop and put it in the oven. Now, the next step is to slice the red potato. The recipe says "slice the red potato". The user has the red potato in their inventory. So the correct command should be "slice red potato". Let me check the available commands. The available commands include "slice ...", so that's the right verb. The user needs to slice the red potato next.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, the user is trying to fry the red potato but the system isn't accepting the command. The recipe says to "fry the red potato". The user has the red potato and the knife. The available commands include "fry ...". The correct command should be "fry red potato". The system says that's not a verb, but maybe it's acceptable. Let me try "fry red potato".
