You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Shed =-
You've entered a shed.

You make out a toolbox. You see a workbench. The workbench is wooden. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is a closed barn door leading west.

You can make out a patio table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a patio table, go to TextWorld. But there isn't a thing on it. You can make out a patio chair. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the patio chair. You make out a closed BBQ close by.

There is an open barn door leading east. There is a closed patio door leading north. There is an exit to the west.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal by finding a recipe in the kitchen. They started in the shed, opened the barn door, and went west to the backyard. Now they're in the backyard, but they haven't found anything useful yet. The backyard has a patio table and chair, a closed BBQ, and doors in four directions. The user has been checking each direction but hasn't found anything. The cookbook is mentioned to be in the kitchen, but they haven't gone back yet.

Wait, the user is at the backyard. The original goal was to check the cookbook in the kitchen. So maybe they need to go back to the kitchen. The shed was the starting point, then they went west to the backyard. The barn door was closed initially, but they opened it and went west. Now, to get back to the kitchen, they might need to go east back through the barn door. But the current location is the backyard, and the barn door is leading east. So maybe the user needs to go east back to the shed, then find another way to the kitchen. Alternatively, maybe there's a patio door north that leads to another area. But the user hasn't checked that yet. However, the user has been looking in all directions and hasn't found anything. The BBQ is closed, so maybe they need to open it? But the original goal is to find the cookbook. 

The user is confused because they've checked all directions and found nothing. The next logical step would be to go back to the shed, then check the kitchen. But the user is currently in the backyard. The exit to the west is the barn door, which they came from. So perhaps they should go east back to the shed, then look for the kitchen. Alternatively, maybe the patio door north leads to the kitchen. But the user hasn't checked that. However, in the previous steps, when they looked north, they saw nothing. Maybe the kitchen is in another part of the house. Alternatively, maybe the workbench in the shed has something. But the user hasn't checked the shed again. 

Wait, the user is in the backyard. The shed is to the east (since they came from the barn door). So to get back to the shed, they need to go east. Then, in the shed, they might find the kitchen. But the initial description of the shed mentioned a toolbox, workbench, and a closed barn door. The kitchen wasn't mentioned there. Maybe the kitchen is connected to the shed. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go through the patio door north. But the user hasn't checked that yet. However, the user has been looking in all directions and hasn't found anything. The next step would be to check the patio door north again, but the user already looked north and saw nothing. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to look for the cookbook in the backyard, but the description says the cookbook is in the kitchen. So the user needs to find the kitchen. The only way is to go back to the shed and then find the kitchen. So the next action should be to go east back to the shed, then check the kitchen. But the user is currently in the backyard. The exit to the west is the barn door, so going east would take them back to the shed. So the next command should be 'go east' to return to the shed. Then, in the shed, they can check the kitchen. But the initial shed description didn't mention a kitchen. Maybe the kitchen is in the shed. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go through the patio door north. But the user hasn't checked that yet. However, the user has already looked in all directions and found nothing. 

So the next logical step is to go back to the shed and check again. The user is in the backyard, so 'go east' would take them back to the shed. Then, in the shed, they can check the toolbox or workbench again, but the cookbook is supposed to be in the kitchen. Maybe the kitchen is connected to the shed. So the user needs to go back to the shed and then find the kitchen. Therefore, the next action is 'go east' to return to the shed.

Okay, the user is trying to find a cookbook to cook a meal. They started in the shed, went to the backyard, and checked all directions but didn't find anything. Now they're back in the shed, but still haven't found the cookbook. The original goal was to check the kitchen for the recipe. The shed doesn't have the kitchen mentioned, so maybe the kitchen is elsewhere. The user has been looking in all directions but maybe missed something. The next step should be to check the toolbox or workbench in the shed, even though they were empty before. Maybe there's something there. Alternatively, maybe the barn door leads to the kitchen. But the barn door was already opened and leads west. Wait, in the shed, the barn door is leading west, which was where they came from. Maybe the kitchen is connected to the shed. Alternatively, maybe they need to go through the barn door west to the backyard again and check again. But the user has already checked the backyard. Hmm. The user is stuck, so the next action should be to check the toolbox again, maybe there's something in there. The command would be 'look toolbox' or 'open toolbox'. But the user has to use the correct commands. The previous actions were 'look around', 'look west', etc. Maybe the correct next step is to check the toolbox again. So the answer is 'look toolbox'.

Now, they're in the backyard again. The original goal was to check the kitchen for the recipe. The user has been looking around but hasn't found the cookbook yet.

In the backyard, there's a patio table and chair, a closed BBQ, and doors leading east (barn door), north (patio door), and west (exit). The user has already checked the backyard thoroughly but didn't find anything. The next logical step would be to check the patio door north, maybe that leads to the kitchen. Alternatively, the BBQ might be a clue, but it's closed. However, the user's main goal is the cookbook in the kitchen. Since the shed didn't have the kitchen, maybe the patio door north leads to the kitchen. So the next action should be to go north through the patio door.

Okay, the user is trying to find a cookbook to cook a meal. They've been moving through different areas: shed, backyard, corridor, living room, and back to the corridor. They've checked various places but haven't found the cookbook yet. The original goal was to check the kitchen for the recipe.

In the current corridor, there's an open patio door south, exits east, north, and west. The user has been going back and forth between the corridor, living room, and backyard. The cookbook hasn't been found yet. Maybe the kitchen is in a different part of the house. The user needs to check all possible paths. The next step should be to check the exit to the north, as the corridor has an exit there. Maybe the kitchen is north of the corridor. So the next action is to go north.

There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the corridor and the living room. They've been going back and forth between the two locations multiple times without finding the cookbook. The original goal was to check the kitchen for the recipe. So far, the user hasn't found the kitchen yet. The corridor has an open patio door south, but the user hasn't tried going that way. Maybe the kitchen is through the patio door. The user should try going south through the patio door instead of continuing to go east and west. Let me check the previous steps. The user was in the corridor, then went east to the living room, then west back to the corridor. The patio door is south from the corridor. So the next action should be to go south through the patio door.

Okay, the user is stuck in the Livingroom, repeatedly trying to go south but can't. They've been moving between the Corridor and Livingroom, but the patio door south is blocked. Maybe the issue is that the patio door is closed again. Earlier, when they were in the Corridor, the patio door was open, but maybe when they tried to go south from the Livingroom, it's blocked. Wait, the user was in the Livingroom, and the exit to the east is open, but the south exit is blocked. The original goal was to find the cookbook in the kitchen. Maybe the kitchen is in a different part. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check other areas again. But since they can't go south, perhaps they need to find another way. The only other exit is west back to the Corridor. But they've been going in circles. Maybe the user needs to check the Livingroom again for clues. The sofa is mentioned, but it's empty. Maybe the cookbook is in the Livingroom, but the user hasn't looked closely. However, the original instruction said the cookbook is in the kitchen. So perhaps the user needs to find the kitchen through another route. But all exits are blocked except the west. Maybe the user needs to go west again to the Corridor and then try another direction. But the user has been doing that repeatedly. Maybe the answer is to give up and check the Livingroom again, but the user has to follow the commands. The next action should be to go west back to the Corridor.

Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the patio chair. You make out a closed BBQ close by.

There is an open barn door leading east. There is an open patio door leading north. There is an exit to the west.

-= Backyard =-
You arrive in a backyard. A standard kind of place. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You can make out a patio table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a patio table, go to TextWorld. But there isn't a thing on it. You can make out a patio chair. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the patio chair. You make out a closed BBQ close by.

There is an open barn door leading east. There is an open patio door leading north. There is an exit to the west.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, the user is stuck in a loop, repeatedly checking the same areas without finding the cookbook. They've been moving between the shed, backyard, corridor, living room, and back again. The original goal was to find the cookbook in the kitchen, but the user hasn't found it yet. All the places they've checked so far don't have the cookbook. Maybe they need to try a different approach. Since the user has been going in circles, the next step should be to check the BBQ in the backyard, even though it's closed. Maybe the cookbook is there. Alternatively, maybe the kitchen is in a different part of the house that hasn't been explored yet. But given the current path, the user needs to try opening the BBQ or checking other closed items. The next action should be to open the BBQ.
