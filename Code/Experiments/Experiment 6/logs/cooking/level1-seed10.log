You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
Welcome to the kitchen.

You can see a fridge. The fridge contains a green bell pepper, a green apple, a green hot pepper and a white onion. You make out a closed oven close by. You can make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw red potato, a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato and a knife. You can see a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You move on, clearly upset with TextWorld.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the recipe from the cookbook. The first step was to slice the green bell pepper. But they kept getting an error about needing a knife. So they took the knife from the counter. Then they tried to use it again.

Wait, the error messages suggest that the system might be expecting a specific command structure. Like, maybe "slice the green bell pepper" is the correct command, but when they tried to use the knife, it didn't work. Then they tried "use knife on green bell pepper" which wasn't recognized. Finally, they tried "slice green bell pepper with knife" which also didn't work. The system said they need to take the green bell pepper first, but they already took it from the fridge.

Hmm, maybe the correct command is just "slice the green bell pepper" after having the knife. But earlier attempts to do that resulted in an error. Wait, maybe the knife is already in hand? Or maybe the system is expecting the knife to be used in conjunction with the action. Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "cut the green bell pepper with the knife".

But the user tried "use knife on green bell pepper" and it didn't work. Then they tried "slice green bell pepper with knife" and it didn't work either. The system said they need to take the green bell pepper first, but they already did. So maybe the problem is that the knife isn't in their inventory yet. Wait, they took the knife from the counter, so it should be in hand. Maybe the correct command is "cut the green bell pepper" without specifying the knife, but the system requires using the knife. Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "slice the green bell pepper" and the system is just having trouble with the previous attempts.

Wait, the user just took the green bell pepper from the fridge. Now, they need to slice it. The previous error was that cutting requires a knife. So they need to have the knife. They took the knife from the counter, so it's in their inventory. So the next step is to slice the green bell pepper. But the system keeps saying that "slice the green bell pepper" is not working. Maybe the correct command is "use the knife to slice the green bell pepper". Or maybe "cut the green bell pepper with the knife".

But the user tried "use knife on green bell pepper" and it didn't work. Then they tried "slice green bell pepper with knife" and it didn't work. The system says "That's not a verb I recognise." So maybe the correct command is "slice the green bell pepper" and the system is having issues with the previous attempts. Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "cut the green bell pepper" with the knife. But the recipe says "slice the green bell pepper".

Wait, the user is in the kitchen, has the green bell pepper and the knife. The next step is to slice it. The correct command should be "slice the green bell pepper" but the system is not recognizing it. Maybe the system requires the knife to be used in the action. So the correct command is "use knife to slice green bell pepper". But the user tried that and it didn't work. Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "cut the green bell pepper with the knife".

But the user is getting errors. Maybe the system is expecting the command "slice the green bell pepper" without the knife, but that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to first take the knife, which they did, and then slice the pepper. But the system is not recognizing the command. Maybe the correct command is "slice the green bell pepper" and the system is just having a glitch. But the user tried that and got an error. So perhaps the correct action is to slice the green bell pepper, and the system is not recognizing it, but the user has to keep trying. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the knife on the pepper. But the system says that's not a verb.

Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "cut the green bell pepper" with the knife. But the recipe says "slice". So maybe the user should just try "slice the green bell pepper" again. But the system is not recognizing it. Maybe the system is expecting the user to have the knife in hand, which they do. So the next step is to slice the pepper. The user has already taken the knife and the pepper. So the correct command is "slice the green bell pepper".

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, the user is trying to follow the recipe from the cookbook. They've successfully sliced the green bell pepper using the knife. The next step in the recipe is to "fry the green bell pepper". However, the user is repeatedly getting an error that "fry is not a verb I recognize". 

Hmm, maybe the game's command system expects a different phrasing. Instead of "fry", perhaps they need to use a verb like "cook" or "heat". Alternatively, the system might require specifying the cooking appliance, like "fry in pan" or "fry on stove". 

Wait, in the kitchen, there's a stove mentioned. The user might need to use the stove to fry the pepper. So the correct command could be "fry the green bell pepper on the stove" or "cook the green bell pepper on the stove". But the recipe just says "fry", so maybe the game expects "fry" without specifying the stove. 

But the user tried "fry the green bell pepper" multiple times and got the same error. Maybe the system is expecting a different verb. Let me check the previous steps. The user took the knife, sliced the pepper. Now, they need to fry it. Maybe the correct command is "heat the green bell pepper" or "cook the green bell pepper". Alternatively, maybe "put the green bell pepper in the pan" or "fry the green bell pepper with the stove".

Alternatively, the game might have a specific command for using the stove. Since the stove is present, perhaps the user needs to "use the stove to fry the green bell pepper". But the error message says "fry is not a verb", so maybe the correct verb is "cook" or "heat".

Wait, the recipe says "fry the green bell pepper", so the user should use the correct verb. Maybe the game is expecting "fry" but the system is not recognizing it. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to first take the stove or the pan. But the stove is already in the kitchen. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the stove as the tool. So the command could be "fry the green bell pepper with the stove". But the system says "fry is not a verb". Maybe the correct verb is "cook" instead of "fry". 

Alternatively, the user might need to use the stove's function. Since the stove is there, maybe the correct command is "cook the green bell pepper on the stove". But the recipe says "fry", so maybe the game is expecting "fry" but the system is not recognizing it. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the stove's action. For example, "heat the stove" and then "fry the pepper". But the user hasn't done that yet. 

Given the error message, the system might not recognize "fry" as a verb. So the user might need to use a different verb like "cook" or "heat". Alternatively, the correct command is "fry the green bell pepper" but the system is having an issue. 

But the user has to follow the recipe's directions. The recipe says "fry the green bell pepper", so the correct action is to fry it. Maybe the system is expecting the user to use the stove. So the command should be "fry the green bell pepper on the stove". But the system says "fry is not a verb". 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the stove's action. For example, "use the stove to fry the green bell pepper". But the system might not recognize that. 

Given the previous errors, the user might need to try a different phrasing. Maybe "cook the green bell pepper" instead of "fry". Or "heat the green bell pepper". 

But the recipe specifically says "fry", so the user should stick to that. Maybe the system is having a glitch, and the correct command is still "fry the green bell pepper". The user has to keep trying. 

So the next action is to try "fry the green bell pepper" again, even though the system says it's not a verb. Maybe the system is just having a problem, and the correct command is indeed "fry".

<think>
Okay, the user is stuck on the "fry the green bell pepper" step. They've tried it multiple times, but the game keeps saying "fry is not a verb I recognize." Let me think about possible reasons.

First, maybe the game expects a different verb. The recipe says "fry," but perhaps the correct command is "cook" or "heat." Alternatively, the user might need to use the stove specifically. The kitchen has a stove, so maybe the command should include the stove, like "fry the green bell pepper on the stove."

Wait, in previous steps, the user took the knife and sliced the pepper. Now, they need to fry it. The error suggests that "fry" isn't recognized. Maybe the game uses "heat" instead of "fry." Or perhaps the user needs to use the stove's action. Let me check the environment again.

The kitchen has a stove, but it's described as "stove. Now why would someone leave that there? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though." So the stove is present but maybe not in use. The user might need to use the stove to fry the pepper. So the correct command could be "heat the green bell pepper on the stove" or "cook the green bell pepper on the stove."

Alternatively, the game might require the user to first take the stove or a pan. But the stove is already in the room. Maybe the correct verb is "fry" but the system is having a glitch. However, the user has to follow the recipe's directions. The recipe says "fry," so the user should try that again. But the system says it's not a verb. Maybe the user needs to use a different phrasing, like "fry the green bell pepper with the stove."

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the stove's function. The stove is there, so the command could be "use the stove to fry the green bell pepper." But the system might not recognize that. 

Given the previous errors, the user might need to try a different verb. Let's try "cook" instead of "fry." So the next action would be "cook the green bell pepper." If that doesn't work, maybe "heat the green bell pepper." But the recipe specifically says "fry," so the user should stick to that. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the stove as the tool. So the command is "fry the green bell pepper on the stove." The system might not recognize "fry" but could accept "cook." Let's try that.

Okay, the user is trying to enjoy their meal. They tried "enjoy meal" but got an error. The previous steps were successful: they sliced the green bell pepper, fried it, and prepared the meal. Now, the next logical step is to eat the meal. The correct command should be "eat the meal" or "enjoy the meal". Since "enjoy" wasn't recognized, maybe "eat" is the correct verb. Let me check the environment again. The user is in the kitchen, and the meal is prepared. So the next action is to eat it. The command should be "eat the meal".
