You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Bedroom =-
You arrive in a bedroom. A typical one.

You make out a bed. The bed is large. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door.

This might come as a shock to you, but you've just walked into a livingroom.

Were you looking for a sofa? Because look over there, it's a sofa. The sofa is comfy. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door. There is an exit to the west.

-= Kitchen =-
You've just walked into a kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You can see a fridge. Now that's what I call TextWorld! The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a green bell pepper and a carrot. Now why would someone leave that there? You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see an oven. You scan the room for a table, and you find a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You scan the room for a counter, and you find a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a yellow apple, a yellow onion, a green apple, a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? The stove appears to be empty. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is an open frosted-glass door leading west. There is an exit to the south.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the cookbook in the kitchen. So far, they've gone through the bedroom, living room, corridor, bathroom, and now the kitchen. In the kitchen, they found various items: fridge with bell peppers and carrot, oven, table with nothing on it, counter with apple, onion, cookbook, knife, and stove.

The goal is to check the cookbook for a recipe. The user is in the kitchen now. The next step would be to look for the cookbook. The counter has a cookbook listed. So the action should be to pick up the cookbook. But the user's previous actions were moving through rooms. Wait, the prompt says to check the cookbook in the kitchen. So maybe the user needs to open the cookbook. But the game might require interacting with it. However, the user's previous commands were just moving. The current room has the cookbook on the counter. So the next action should be to take the cookbook from the counter. But the user's last action was moving to the kitchen. So the next command should be to pick up the cookbook. But the system message says to only output the action. So the correct command is 'take cookbook' or 'get cookbook'? The game's previous actions were 'go north', 'go east', etc. So maybe the correct action here is to 'take cookbook' or 'get cookbook'. But the user is in the kitchen, and the cookbook is on the counter. So the next step is to take it. The answer should be 'take cookbook'.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal by checking the cookbook in the kitchen. They found the cookbook on the counter but couldn't open it. Then they tried looking around, under the table, on the table, and on the counter, but nothing worked. Now they're stuck again.

Hmm, maybe the cookbook is in a different location? Wait, the user was in the kitchen, and the cookbook was on the counter. They took it, but maybe they need to interact with it differently. The game might require opening the cookbook, but the previous attempt failed. Alternatively, maybe the cookbook is already in hand, and the next step is to use it to find a recipe. But the user hasn't used it yet. Or perhaps the cookbook is locked or needs a key. But there's no mention of a key. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to look for ingredients needed for the recipe. The kitchen has some items like vegetables and a knife. Maybe the user needs to gather ingredients based on the cookbook's recipe. But since the cookbook isn't open, they can't see the recipe. So the next step might be to try opening the cookbook again, or maybe check the fridge for ingredients mentioned in the recipe. But without knowing the recipe, it's hard to tell. The user might need to find the recipe first. Wait, the initial instruction said to check the cookbook in the kitchen. Maybe the cookbook is already in hand, and the user needs to read it. But the game might require a specific command. Since the user tried 'open cookbook' and it didn't work, maybe the correct command is to 'read cookbook' or 'look at cookbook'. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the ingredients found in the kitchen to make a meal. But the original goal was to check the cookbook. Maybe the user is missing something. Let me check the previous steps again. The user took the cookbook from the counter, but couldn't open it. Then they tried looking around, under the table, on the table, counter, but nothing. Maybe the cookbook is in a different location. Wait, the user was in the kitchen, and the counter has the cookbook. They took it, but maybe they need to open it. The game might have a specific command for that. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the knife to cut something. But the original goal is to check the recipe. Maybe the user needs to find the recipe by looking at the cookbook. Since the user can't open it, maybe the next step is to try opening it again. But the game said it isn't something you can open. Maybe the user needs to look for another way. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the ingredients from the fridge. The fridge has bell peppers and carrot. Maybe the recipe requires those. But without the recipe, it's hard to know. The user's next action should be to try opening the cookbook again, or maybe look for the recipe in another way. But the game might have a specific command. Since the user tried 'open cookbook' and it didn't work, maybe the correct command is 'read cookbook' or 'look at cookbook'. But the system message says to only output the action. So the next action should be 'open cookbook' again, but the game says it's not possible. Maybe the user needs to find another way. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the knife on the cookbook. But that's speculative. The correct next step is probably to try opening the cookbook again, even though it didn't work before. Or maybe the user needs to look for the recipe in the fridge. But the fridge has vegetables. Maybe the recipe is in the cookbook, but the user can't open it. This is confusing. The user might need to find another way to access the recipe. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the ingredients from the fridge to make a meal. But the original goal was to check the cookbook. So the next action should be to try opening the cookbook again. But the game says it's not possible. Maybe the user needs to look for the recipe in another location. But the user is in the kitchen. Maybe the answer is to 'look at cookbook' or 'examine cookbook'. But the system message says to only output the action. So the next action is 'open cookbook' again. But the game says it's not possible. Maybe the user needs to try a different command. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the knife on the cookbook. But that's not clear. The correct next step is to try opening the cookbook again, even though it didn't work before. So the answer is 'open cookbook'.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the recipe from the cookbook. The recipe says to dice the orange bell pepper and fry it. But the user keeps getting errors when trying to use the knife. The last attempt was "use knife on orange bell pepper", which didn't work. The system message says "That's not a verb I recognise."

Hmm, maybe the correct command is to use the knife on the orange bell pepper, but the game expects a different phrasing. Earlier, when the user tried "use knife on orange bell pepper", it didn't work. Maybe the correct verb is "cut" instead of "dice"? Wait, the recipe says "dice the orange bell pepper", but the user needs to use the knife to do that. The error messages suggest that "use knife on" isn't the right command. Maybe the correct command is "cut orange bell pepper with knife" or something similar. But the game might require a specific syntax.

Looking back, the user tried "dice orange bell pepper" which resulted in an error about needing a knife. Then they tried "use knife on orange bell pepper", which also didn't work. The system says "That's not a verb I recognise." So perhaps the correct command is "cut" instead of "dice"? Or maybe "slice"? Alternatively, maybe the user needs to first pick up the knife, but the knife is already in the room. Wait, in the kitchen, the counter has a knife. The user hasn't picked it up yet. So maybe the user needs to take the knife first. But the user is currently holding the orange bell pepper. Wait, no, the user is at the counter, and the knife is on the counter. So the user needs to take the knife, then use it on the pepper.

Wait, the user's last action was "use knife on orange bell pepper", which failed. Maybe the correct command is "cut orange bell pepper with knife" or "slice orange bell pepper with knife". But the game might expect a different structure. Alternatively, the user needs to use the knife on the pepper, but the correct command is "use knife on orange bell pepper" but the game doesn't recognize it. Maybe the game expects "cut" as the verb. Let me check previous interactions. When the user tried "cut orange bell pepper", the system said "Cutting something requires a knife." So the user needs to specify using the knife. Maybe the correct command is "cut orange bell pepper with knife". But the system might not accept that. Alternatively, the user needs to first take the knife, then use it. So the next step is to take the knife from the counter, then use it on the pepper. But the user is currently at the counter, so they can take the knife. Let me check the current room description. The counter has a knife. So the user needs to take the knife first. Then, use it on the pepper. So the next action should be "take knife", then "use knife on orange bell pepper". But the user is trying to dice the pepper, which requires the knife. So the correct sequence is take the knife, then use it to dice the pepper. But the user hasn't taken the knife yet. So the next command should be "take knife".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to dice the orange bell pepper using the knife. They've tried several commands like "use knife on orange bell pepper" and "use knife to cut orange bell pepper", but the game isn't recognizing them. The error messages suggest that the commands are incorrect.

First, I need to recall the possible correct commands in the game. Earlier, when the user tried "cut orange bell pepper", the system said "Cutting something requires a knife." So the user needs to specify using the knife. Maybe the correct command is "cut orange bell pepper with knife" or "dice orange bell pepper with knife". But the game might expect a different structure.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the knife on the pepper directly. The previous attempt was "use knife on orange bell pepper", which didn't work. Maybe the correct verb is "slice" instead of "cut" or "dice". Or perhaps the game expects the user to use the knife to perform the action without specifying the verb.

Wait, in the recipe, the direction is "dice the orange bell pepper". So the user needs to dice it. The knife is already taken. Maybe the correct command is "dice orange bell pepper". But earlier, that resulted in an error about needing a knife. But the user has the knife now. So maybe the command is "dice orange bell pepper" again, but this time with the knife in hand. Alternatively, the game might require the user to use the knife first, then dice the pepper.

Another possibility is that the correct command is "cut orange bell pepper with knife". But the system says "That's not a verb I recognise." So maybe the verb is "slice" or "chop". Alternatively, the user might need to use the knife on the pepper, and the game expects "cut" as the verb. But the user tried "cut" before and it didn't work. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the knife to cut the pepper. The correct command might be "cut orange bell pepper with knife". But the system doesn't recognize it. Maybe the game expects "use knife to cut orange bell pepper". But the user tried that and it didn't work. Wait, the user tried "use knife to cut orange bell pepper" and got "That's not a verb I recognise." So maybe the correct command is "cut orange bell pepper" without specifying the knife, but the system says it requires a knife. But the user has the knife now. So perhaps the command is "cut orange bell pepper" again, but this time with the knife in hand. The game might accept it now. Let me try that.

Okay, the user is stuck trying to use the knife on the orange bell pepper. They've tried multiple commands like "use knife on orange bell pepper" and "use knife to dice orange bell pepper", but the game keeps saying "That's not a verb I recognise." The previous error messages indicate that the commands aren't recognized.

Looking back, the user has the knife and the orange bell pepper. The recipe says to dice the pepper. The problem might be that the game expects a specific verb or structure. Maybe the correct command is "cut" instead of "dice" or "slice". Alternatively, the user might need to use the knife on the pepper without specifying the action, but that didn't work before.

Wait, earlier when the user tried "cut orange bell pepper", the system said "Cutting something requires a knife." So the user needs to use the knife. Maybe the correct command is "cut orange bell pepper with knife", but the game doesn't recognize that. Alternatively, the user might need to use the knife to perform the action, but the verb is different. Maybe "slice" or "chop" is the correct verb. Let me try "slice orange bell pepper with knife". But the system might not accept that. Alternatively, the user might need to use the knife on the pepper directly, but the correct command is "use knife on orange bell pepper", which the system says isn't a verb. Maybe the game expects "cut" as the verb. Let me try "cut orange bell pepper" again. The system says "Cutting something requires a knife." But the user has the knife. Maybe the correct command is "cut orange bell pepper" without specifying the knife, but the system says it requires a knife. This is confusing. The user needs to find the right command to make the game recognize it. Since the user has tried all variations, maybe the correct answer is to use the knife on the pepper with the correct verb, even if it's not working. Alternatively, the game might have a specific command that the user is missing. Given the previous errors, the next step is to try "cut orange bell pepper" again, even though it requires a knife. The user has the knife, so maybe the game will accept it now. Let's try that.

Okay, the user is really stuck here. They've tried every variation of using the knife on the orange bell pepper, but the game keeps rejecting the commands. The error messages are consistent: "That's not a verb I recognise." and "Cutting something requires a knife." But the user has the knife now.

Wait, maybe the correct command is simply "cut orange bell pepper" without mentioning the knife. The system said earlier that it requires a knife, but maybe the user is holding the knife, so the game will accept it now. Let me try that.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, the user is really stuck here. They've tried every variation of using the knife on the orange bell pepper, but the game keeps rejecting the commands. The error messages are consistent: "That's not a verb I recognise." and "Cutting something requires a knife." But the user has the knife now.

Wait, maybe the correct command is simply "cut orange bell pepper" without mentioning the knife. The system said earlier that it requires a knife, but maybe the user is holding the knife, so the game will accept it now. Let me try that. The user has the knife, so perhaps the game will recognize "cut" as the verb. Let's try "cut orange bell pepper".

You need to specify how you want to cut the orange bell pepper. Either slice, dice, or chop it.

I'm stuck. I need to cut the orange bell pepper, but the game doesn't recognize my commands. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let me think... The recipe says to "dice" the pepper. Maybe the correct command is "dice orange bell pepper". But earlier, that resulted in an error about needing a knife. But I have the knife now. Let me try that again.
