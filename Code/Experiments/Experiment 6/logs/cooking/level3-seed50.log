You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You're now in a kitchen.

You make out an opened fridge in the corner. The fridge contains a block of cheese. You can see an oven. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a green hot pepper, a green apple, a green bell pepper, a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. You make out a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.
