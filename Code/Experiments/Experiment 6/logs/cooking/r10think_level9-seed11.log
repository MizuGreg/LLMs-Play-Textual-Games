Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me think through this. The user is in a garden scene where they've been picking up various items. The goal seems to be cooking a meal using the ingredients found here. So far, they've collected an orange bell pepper, yellow bell pepper, tomato, white onion, and red apple. The next step would logically be to find a way to cook these ingredients.

The initial prompt mentioned checking the cookbook in the kitchen. So maybe the next action is to go to the kitchen. But the current location is the garden, and the exit is to the south. Wait, the user hasn't checked the kitchen yet. The kitchen might be a separate location, but the exit is to the south. However, the user is in the garden, and the kitchen might be accessible from there. Alternatively, maybe the kitchen is part of the garden's layout.

But the user has been picking up items, and the next step after gathering ingredients is to cook. Since the user hasn't gone to the kitchen yet, the next action should be to go to the kitchen. However, the exit is to the south. Let me check the environment again.

The environment description says: "There is an exit to the south." So the user is in the garden, and the exit is to the south. But the kitchen might be in the garden or another location. Wait, the user is supposed to check the cookbook in the kitchen. So the kitchen must be a different location. But the exit is to the south. Maybe the kitchen is south of the garden. So the user should go south to the kitchen.

But the user hasn't moved yet. So the next action should be to go south to the kitchen. However, the user is in the garden, and the exit is to the south. So the correct action is to go south. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next step is to go to the kitchen, which is south. Therefore, the next command should be "go south".

-= Backyard =-
You arrive in a backyard. An ordinary one.

Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a patio chair. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a patio chair? The patio chair is stylish. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? Hey, want to see a patio table? Look over there, a patio table. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You make out a closed BBQ close by.

There is a closed patio door leading south. There is a closed wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is in a text-based game where they need to collect ingredients to cook a meal. They started in the garden, picking up various vegetables and fruits. They moved to the backyard, but the main goal is to cook something, so the next step should be to use the ingredients they've collected.

The user has been picking up items like bell peppers, tomato, onion, apple, and now potatoes and hot peppers. The score is increasing each time they pick something up. The original goal was to check the cookbook in the kitchen. But the user hasn't gone to the kitchen yet. The exit to the south was leading to the backyard, but maybe the kitchen is another location.

Wait, the user tried going south multiple times, but the kitchen wasn't in the backyard. Maybe the kitchen is in the garden or another part. However, the current location is the garden, and the exit is to the south. The user might need to find the kitchen through another path. But the environment descriptions don't mention a kitchen yet. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the ingredients they've collected to cook. The BBQ in the backyard is mentioned as closed. Maybe they need to open it and use the ingredients there. But the user hasn't interacted with the BBQ yet. The next step could be to go to the BBQ, open it, and start cooking. But the user hasn't done that yet.

Looking at the previous actions, the user has been picking up items and moving between locations. The score is increasing, but the goal is to cook a meal. So the final step is to use the collected ingredients in the kitchen or BBQ. Since the user is in the garden, maybe they need to go to the kitchen, which might be accessible through the exit to the south. But the backyard's description doesn't mention a kitchen. 

Alternatively, the user might need to cook the ingredients they've collected in the backyard's BBQ. The closed BBQ could be the place to cook. So the next action should be to go to the BBQ, open it, and start cooking. But the user hasn't interacted with the BBQ yet. The command would be to go to the BBQ, but the available actions are moving directions. The user is in the garden, and the exit is to the south. The backyard has a closed BBQ. So maybe the next step is to go to the BBQ, open it, and use the ingredients. But the user needs to move to the BBQ's location. 

Wait, the user is in the garden, and the backyard is south. The BBQ is in the backyard. So the user needs to go south to the backyard, then interact with the BBQ. But the user has already tried going south and is stuck in a loop. The BBQ is closed, so maybe the user needs to open it. But the available commands are movement. The user might need to go to the BBQ, open it, and then cook the ingredients. However, the user hasn't done that yet. The next action should be to go to the BBQ, but the user is already in the garden. The exit to the south is the backyard. So the correct next step is to go south to the backyard, then interact with the BBQ. But the user has already done that. The BBQ is closed, so maybe the user needs to open it. But the game might require the user to use the correct commands. Since the user is in the backyard, the next step is to interact with the BBQ. But the available commands are movement. The user might need to go to the BBQ's location, which is in the backyard. So the next action is to go to the BBQ, but the user is already there. Maybe the user needs to open the BBQ. But the game might not have that command. Alternatively, the user needs to cook the ingredients they've collected. Since they have all the necessary items, the next step is to cook. But the game might require the user to use the BBQ. So the final action is to cook the meal using the ingredients. But the user hasn't done that yet. The correct next step is to go to the BBQ, open it, and start cooking. But the user needs to move to the BBQ's location. The user is in the backyard, so the next action is to go to the BBQ. However, the game might not have that command. Alternatively, the user needs to use the ingredients they've collected to cook. Since they have all the ingredients, the next step is to cook. But the game might require the user to use the BBQ. So the final action is to cook the meal. But the user needs to interact with the BBQ. The correct command would be to use the ingredients in the BBQ. But the game might not have that command. The user might need to go to the kitchen, but the kitchen isn't mentioned. Therefore, the next action is to go to the BBQ and cook the meal.

<think>
Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is in a text-based game where they need to cook a meal. They've been picking up ingredients in the garden and backyard. The main goal is to check the cookbook in the kitchen, but the user hasn't found the kitchen yet.

The user has been moving between the garden and backyard, picking up items like peppers, tomatoes, onions, and potatoes. They tried to cook a meal but couldn't because the BBQ is closed. The game's environment mentions a closed BBQ in the backyard, so maybe the user needs to open it. However, the available commands are movement, so the user might need to go to the BBQ's location and then open it. But the user hasn't interacted with the BBQ yet.

The user is stuck in a loop between the garden and backyard, trying to cook but unable to. The next step should be to find the kitchen where the cookbook is. The exit to the south leads to the backyard, but the kitchen might be accessible through another door. The backyard has a closed wooden door leading west. Maybe the user needs to go west through that door to find the kitchen. Alternatively, the kitchen could be in the garden, but the exit is to the south.

Since the user hasn't found the kitchen yet, the next action should be to explore the backyard's other exits. The closed wooden door west might lead to the kitchen. So the correct next step is to go west through the wooden door. That makes sense because the user needs to access the kitchen to check the cookbook and then cook the meal.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal in this text game. They've been collecting ingredients in the garden and backyard. The main goal is to check the cookbook in the kitchen. So far, they've picked up various vegetables and fruits, but they haven't found the kitchen yet.

The user tried going south to the backyard, then west through the wooden door, which led them to a shed. From the shed, they went east back to the backyard. Now they're back in the garden, with the exit to the south. The original plan was to go to the kitchen, but the kitchen hasn't been located yet. The backyard has a closed BBQ, but the user can't cook yet because the BBQ is closed. The shed didn't have the cookbook either.

The user needs to find the kitchen. The backyard's description mentions a closed patio door leading south and an open wooden door leading west. The shed was accessible via the west door. Maybe the kitchen is elsewhere. Wait, the garden's exit is to the south, which leads back to the backyard. The user has been looping between the garden and backyard. Maybe the kitchen is in the backyard, but it's not mentioned. Alternatively, the user might need to interact with the BBQ in the backyard. But the BBQ is closed. The user tried cooking but couldn't. The next step should be to open the BBQ or find the kitchen.

Since the user is in the garden again, maybe they need to go south to the backyard again and try to open the BBQ. But the BBQ is closed. Alternatively, the kitchen might be through another door. The backyard has a closed patio door south and an open wooden door west. The shed was west of the backyard. Maybe the kitchen is in the shed? But the shed only had a toolbox and workbench. No cookbook there.

Wait, the original instruction said to check the cookbook in the kitchen. So the kitchen must be a separate location. The user hasn't found it yet. The only way is to explore more. The user is in the garden, exit to the south. Maybe the kitchen is south of the garden? But the backyard is south. The user tried going south and ended up in the backyard. Maybe the kitchen is in the backyard, but it's not mentioned. Alternatively, the user needs to find another way.

The user's last action was going north back to the garden. Now they're in the garden again. The next step should be to go south to the backyard again and try to open the BBQ or find the kitchen. Since the BBQ is closed, maybe the user needs to open it. But the game doesn't have an 'open' command for the BBQ. The user can't see the cookbook yet. So the correct next action is to go south to the backyard and try to interact with the BBQ or find the kitchen. But the user has to move there again.

Wait, the user's score is 2/47, meaning they have 2 points. The original goal was to cook a meal, which requires the cookbook. The user needs to find the cookbook in the kitchen.

Maybe the user needs to check the workbench for the cookbook. But the workbench was empty. 

Alternatively, the user might need to go to the BBQ and try to cook despite it being closed. But the game says they can't see the cookbook. The user is stuck. The correct next action is to go west again to the shed, check the workbench, and maybe find the cookbook there. But the shed's description didn't mention it. The user might need to try that.

<think>
Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the garden and backyard, repeatedly going north and south. The main goal is to cook a meal by checking the cookbook in the kitchen. So far, they've collected various ingredients but haven't found the kitchen yet.

The backyard has a closed BBQ, but the user can't cook because it's closed. The shed west of the backyard was explored earlier but didn't have the cookbook. The user needs to find the kitchen. The only way is to explore the open wooden door west again, but they already did that and went to the shed. Maybe the kitchen is in the shed? But the shed only had a toolbox and workbench. Alternatively, the user might need to check the workbench in the shed for the cookbook. But the workbench was empty. 

Alternatively, the user might need to go to the BBQ and try to cook despite it being closed. But the game doesn't have an 'open' command for the BBQ. The user can't see the cookbook yet, so they need to find the kitchen. The only remaining option is to go west again to the shed, check the workbench, and maybe find the cookbook there. But the shed's description didn't mention it. The user might need to try that.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

<think>
Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the garden and backyard, repeatedly going north and south. The main goal is to cook a meal by checking the cookbook in the kitchen. So far, they've collected various ingredients but haven't found the kitchen yet.

The backyard has a closed BBQ, but the user can't cook because it's closed. The shed west of the backyard was explored earlier but didn't have the cookbook. The user needs to find the kitchen. The only way is to explore the open wooden door west again, but they already did that and went to the shed. Maybe the kitchen is in the shed? But the shed only had a toolbox and workbench. Alternatively, the user might need to check the workbench in the shed for the cookbook. But the workbench was empty. 

Alternatively, the user might need to go to the BBQ and try to cook despite it being closed. But the game doesn't have an 'open' command for the BBQ. The user can't see the cookbook yet, so they need to find the kitchen. The only remaining option is to go west again to the shed, check the workbench, and maybe find the cookbook there. But the shed's description didn't mention it. The user might need to try that.

-= Backyard =-
You arrive in a backyard. An ordinary one.

Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a patio chair. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a patio chair? The patio chair is stylish. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? Hey, want to see a patio table? Look over there, a patio table. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You make out a closed BBQ close by.

There is a closed patio door leading south. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.
