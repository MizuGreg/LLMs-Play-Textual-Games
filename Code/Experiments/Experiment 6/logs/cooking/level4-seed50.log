You've just sauntered into a bathroom. You begin looking for stuff.



There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a fridge, so there's that. The fridge contains a white onion and a red bell pepper. You see a closed oven nearby. You scan the room for a table, and you find a table. But there isn't a thing on it. You smell a hideous smell, and follow it to a counter. You see a green hot pepper, a green bell pepper, an orange bell pepper, a yellow apple, a tomato, a raw yellow potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You can make out a stove. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a stove, go to TextWorld. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is an open frosted-glass door leading east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door. There is an exit to the south.

You find yourself in a kitchen. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a fridge, so there's that. The fridge contains a white onion and a red bell pepper. You see a closed oven nearby. You scan the room for a table, and you find a table. But there isn't a thing on it. You smell a hideous smell, and follow it to a counter. You see a green hot pepper, a green bell pepper, an orange bell pepper, a yellow apple, a tomato, a raw yellow potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You can make out a stove. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a stove, go to TextWorld. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is an open frosted-glass door leading east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door. There is an exit to the south.
