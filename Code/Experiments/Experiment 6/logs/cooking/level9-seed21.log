You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
Well how about that, you are in a place we're calling a kitchen. Let's see what's in here.

You can make out a fridge. You can see an oven. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the counter you make out a green hot pepper, a green bell pepper, a red bell pepper and a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. Oh, great. Here's a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is a closed patio door leading east. There is a closed plain door leading north. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.
