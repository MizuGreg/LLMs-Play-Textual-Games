You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Corridor =-
Ah, the corridor. This is some kind of corridor, really great ordinary vibes in this place, a wonderful ordinary atmosphere. You begin looking for stuff.



There is a closed patio door leading north. There is an exit to the east. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. An ordinary one.

You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a closed oven in the corner. You can make out a table. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. Hmmm... what else, what else? You see a counter. The counter is vast. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

There is a closed frosted-glass door leading north. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.
