You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. An usual one.

Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a fridge. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The fridge contains a green bell pepper, a block of cheese, a green hot pepper, an orange bell pepper, a raw red tuna and a carrot. Hey, want to see an oven? Look over there, an oven. You can make out a table. The table is massive. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a cookbook and a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.
