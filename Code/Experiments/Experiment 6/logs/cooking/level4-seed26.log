-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. A normal one. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."

You can make out an opened fridge here. What a letdown! The fridge is empty! You can make out a closed oven in the room. You can make out a table. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You can see a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. You see a cookbook on the counter. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh, great. Here's a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is an open frosted-glass door leading east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door.

GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. A normal one. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."

You can make out an opened fridge here. What a letdown! The fridge is empty! You can make out a closed oven in the room. You can make out a table. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You can see a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. You see a cookbook on the counter. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh, great. Here's a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is an open frosted-glass door leading east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door.
