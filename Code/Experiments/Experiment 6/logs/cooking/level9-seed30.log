-= Bedroom =-
You've just sauntered into a bedroom.

You make out a bed. The bed is large. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a bed in a room.

You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.

-= Livingroom =-
You find yourself in a livingroom. A typical kind of place. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a sofa. The sofa is comfy. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.
