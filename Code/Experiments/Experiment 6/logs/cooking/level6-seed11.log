You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Bedroom =-
If you're wondering why everything seems so standard all of a sudden, it's because you've just sauntered into the bedroom. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

Look over there! a bed. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Hm. Oh well

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one.
