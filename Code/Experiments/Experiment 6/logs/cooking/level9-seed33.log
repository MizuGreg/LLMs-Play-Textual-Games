You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Backyard =-
You arrive in a backyard. A typical kind of place.

You make out a patio table. The patio table is stylish. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. Sometimes, just sometimes, TextWorld can just be the worst. You can see a patio chair. The patio chair is stylish. However, the patio chair, like an empty patio chair, has nothing on it. You make out a closed BBQ, which looks recent, close by.

There is a closed barn door leading east. There is a closed sliding patio door leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

You are in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.

A closed fridge is in the room. You can see a closed conventional looking oven right there by you. Oh, great. Here's a table. Now why would someone leave that there? You see a knife on the table. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You see a counter. On the counter you make out a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You smell a pungent smell, and follow it to a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is a closed frosted-glass door leading east. There is an open sliding patio door leading south. You need an exit without a door? You should try going north. There is an exit to the west.
