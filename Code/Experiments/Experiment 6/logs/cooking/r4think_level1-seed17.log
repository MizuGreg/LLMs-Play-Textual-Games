You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You're now in the kitchen. You begin looking for stuff.

You can make out a fridge. The fridge contains a red onion, a red bell pepper, a yellow onion, a raw white tuna and a white onion. You can see an oven. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they need to cook a meal. The goal is to follow a recipe from the cookbook and then enjoy the meal. So far, they've tried to open the cookbook but couldn't. Then they looked around, but didn't find anything. Now they're asking if they're on the right track and what their next move should be.

First, I need to recall the environment. The kitchen has a fridge with various vegetables and tuna, an oven, a stove, a table with a cookbook and a knife, and some strange noises. The user tried to open the cookbook but it wasn't possible. Maybe the cookbook is in a different place or needs to be accessed another way. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to find the recipe first.

Since the cookbook is on the table, perhaps the user needs to pick it up. But the previous attempt to open it failed. Maybe the cookbook is closed, so they need to open it first. But the user tried that and it didn't work. Wait, maybe the user needs to look at the cookbook to find the recipe. Or maybe the cookbook is a book that needs to be opened, but the game doesn't allow that action. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to find the ingredients first.

The user is hungry and needs to cook. The fridge has ingredients. The stove and oven are available. The table has a knife. The user might need to gather ingredients, prepare them, and then cook. But the main issue is accessing the recipe. Since the cookbook is on the table, maybe the next step is to take the cookbook. Then, perhaps read it or find the recipe. But the user tried to open it and it didn't work. Maybe the action is to look at the cookbook instead of open it. Or maybe the user needs to find the recipe in the kitchen elsewhere.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check the fridge for ingredients needed for a recipe. The cookbook might have a recipe that requires specific items. The user has to find the recipe first. Since the cookbook is on the table, perhaps the next step is to take the cookbook. Then, look through it to find the recipe. But the user tried to open it and it didn't work. Maybe the correct action is to take the cookbook first. Let me check the previous steps again.

In the initial state, the user is in the kitchen. The table has a cookbook and a knife. The user tried to open the cookbook but it wasn't possible. Then they looked around but couldn't find anything. So maybe the next step is to take the cookbook. Then, perhaps the recipe is in the cookbook, and once it's taken, the user can read it. But the game might require the user to open the cookbook after taking it. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to look at the cookbook to find the recipe. So the next action should be to take the cookbook. Then, perhaps look at it to find the recipe. But the user tried to open it and it didn't work. Maybe the correct action is to take the cookbook first. So the next command should be "take cookbook" or "pick up cookbook". Then, once it's taken, the user can look at it to find the recipe. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to find the recipe in the kitchen elsewhere. But given the current state, the cookbook is on the table. So the next step is to take it. Then, perhaps the recipe is available. So the answer should be to take the cookbook.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the recipe from the cookbook. The recipe says to chop the red onion. They have the knife now. Wait, the previous attempt to chop the red onion failed because the knife wasn't available. Then they took the knife from the table. Now they're trying to chop the red onion again. But the system message says "Cutting something requires a knife." But they already took the knife. Maybe the knife is in their inventory now. So the next step should be to chop the red onion with the knife. But the system might need the exact command. The previous command was "chop red onion", which failed. Maybe the correct command is "chop the red onion with the knife"? But the game might expect a different syntax. Alternatively, maybe the knife is already in hand, so just chopping the onion is sufficient. Wait, the user has the knife, so perhaps the action is just "chop red onion" again. But the system says it requires a knife. Maybe the user needs to use the knife explicitly. Let me check the previous steps. The user took the knife, so now they can use it. The next action should be to chop the onion with the knife. But the game might accept "chop red onion" again. Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "chop the red onion". Let me think. The user has the knife, so the action should be possible. The system might have a typo, but the user needs to proceed. So the next action is to chop the red onion again.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to chop the red onion with the knife. They tried "chop red onion" which failed, then tried "use knife on red onion" which wasn't recognized. So, what's the correct action here? The game might expect a specific verb. Maybe "cut" instead of "chop"? Or "slice"? Alternatively, maybe the command is "chop the red onion with the knife". But the previous attempt to use "use knife on" didn't work. The user has the knife and the onion. The recipe says "chop the red onion". Maybe the correct command is "chop the red onion" again, but the system says it requires a knife. Wait, the user already has the knife. Maybe the game is expecting the user to use the knife explicitly. Maybe the correct command is "cut red onion with knife". Or perhaps "slice the red onion". Alternatively, maybe the user needs to put the onion on the counter first. But the user is holding the onion. Hmm. The previous error was "Cutting something requires a knife." So maybe the user needs to use the knife to cut the onion. The correct command might be "cut red onion with knife". But the game might not recognize that. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "chop the red onion" again, assuming the knife is available. Since the user took the knife, maybe the system is just being picky and the correct command is "chop red onion". Let me try that again.

Okay, the user is trying to cut the red onion with the knife. They've tried "chop red onion", "use knife on red onion", and "cut red onion with knife". The game hasn't accepted any of these. The error messages suggest that the commands aren't recognized. Maybe the correct verb is "slice" instead of "cut" or "chop". Alternatively, the game might require a specific phrase like "cut the red onion with the knife". Let me try "slice red onion with knife". If that doesn't work, maybe "cut the red onion". The user needs to find the right command that the game understands. Since the previous attempts failed, perhaps the correct action is "cut the red onion" without mentioning the knife, assuming it's already in hand. Alternatively, the game might need the knife to be used explicitly. Let me try "cut the red onion".

Okay, the user is trying to use the knife on the red onion but keeps getting an error. They took the red onion from the fridge and are now trying to "thouse" it, which is obviously a typo. The correct verb should be "chop" or "slice". Since the game previously accepted "chop" but required a knife, maybe the correct command is "chop red onion with knife". But the user might have misspelled "chop" as "thouse". So the next step is to correct the command to "chop red onion with knife" or "slice red onion with knife". Let me check the previous steps. The user has the knife and the onion. The recipe says to chop the onion. The correct command should be "chop red onion with the knife" or similar.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, the user is trying to finish the recipe. They have the red onion roasted in the oven. The next step according to the recipe is to "prepare meal". But the game isn't recognizing "teenth" as a command. Wait, maybe there's a typo. The user might have meant "heat" or "serve". Alternatively, the correct command could be "prepare meal" or "serve the meal". Since the recipe says "prepare meal" after roasting, the next action should be to prepare the meal. The correct command is "prepare meal".

Okay, the user is trying to prepare the meal but keeps getting errors. The recipe says to follow the directions: chop, roast, and prepare the meal. The user has already chopped and roasted the red onion. The next step is to prepare the meal, but the game isn't recognizing the command. Maybe the correct term is "serve" or "finish". Alternatively, maybe they need to use the stove or oven again. Since the oven is open and the onion is inside, perhaps the meal is ready to be served. The correct command might be "serve meal" or "eat meal". But the game says "You still miss something." So maybe the user needs to check if all ingredients are used or if there's another step. Wait, the recipe only mentions the red onion. Maybe the meal is just the roasted onion. So the final step is to serve it. The correct command is "serve meal" or "eat meal". Let me try "serve meal".

Okay, the user is stuck on the last step. They need to "prepare meal" but the game isn't recognizing it. The recipe says to follow the directions: chop, roast, and prepare the meal. The user has done the first two steps. The third step is preparing the meal. Maybe the correct command is "serve" or "eat". But the game says "You can't see any such thing." Maybe the meal is already prepared, and the user just needs to eat it. The correct command might be "eat" or "consume". Let me try "eat meal".
