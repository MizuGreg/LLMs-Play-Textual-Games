You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You've just walked into a kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

You see a fridge. The fridge contains a yellow onion, a raw white tuna, a white onion, a raw red tuna, a yellow bell pepper, a red onion and a red bell pepper. Now why would someone leave that there? You can make out an oven. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. You scan the room, seeing a table. The table is massive. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a yellow apple, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal based on the recipe from the cookbook. The recipe requires white tuna, yellow onion, and yellow potato. 

First, they checked the cookbook and found the recipe. Then they tried to take the white tuna from the counter, but it wasn't there. They looked around again but couldn't find it. The counter has the raw yellow potato, yellow apple, raw red potato, cookbook, and knife. The fridge has a raw white tuna, but the user didn't check there yet.

Wait, the fridge is mentioned in the initial description. The user walked into the kitchen and saw the fridge containing a yellow onion, raw white tuna, etc. But when they checked the counter, they didn't look in the fridge. Maybe the white tuna is in the fridge, not on the counter. The user might have missed checking the fridge.

So the next step should be to check the fridge for the white tuna. The user has been looking in the wrong places. The recipe says "white tuna" is an ingredient, and the fridge has a raw white tuna. So the correct action is to open the fridge and take the white tuna from there.

Okay, let's see. The user has successfully taken the white tuna from the fridge. Now, they need to gather the other ingredients: yellow onion and yellow potato. The recipe says to dice the white tuna, roast it, chop the yellow onion, fry it, etc. 

The user already has the white tuna. The yellow onion is in the fridge, as per the initial inventory. The yellow potato is on the counter. So next steps would be to take the yellow onion from the fridge and the yellow potato from the counter. Then proceed with chopping and frying as per the recipe.

But the user's last action was taking the white tuna. Now, they need to get the yellow onion. The fridge is already open, so they can take the yellow onion from there. Then go to the counter for the yellow potato. After that, they might need to use the knife to chop the onion and potato, then fry them in the stove. But the stove is empty, so maybe they need to put the ingredients in and heat it up. The user has to follow the directions step by step. So the next action should be taking the yellow onion from the fridge.

Okay, let's see. The user has chopped the yellow onion and the yellow potato. The next step in the recipe is to fry both of them. So they need to put the chopped onion and potato into the stove. But the stove is conventional, so maybe they need to place the ingredients on the stove and turn it on. The user has the knife, but now they need to use the stove. The previous actions were chopping, so the next logical step is to fry the onion and potato. But the stove is empty, so they need to put the ingredients there. The command would be to fry the chopped yellow onion and chopped yellow potato. But the game might require specific commands. The directions say "fry the yellow onion" and "fry the yellow potato". So the user should fry each one. But since they're both chopped, maybe they can put both in the stove at once. The correct command would be to fry the yellow onion and yellow potato. But the game might need separate commands. Wait, the user just chopped both, so next is to fry them. The stove is conventional, so maybe the action is to put them in and fry. The exact command would be "fry yellow onion" and "fry yellow potato". But the user has to do them one by one. Alternatively, maybe "fry the yellow onion and yellow potato". But the game might require individual commands. Let me check the previous steps. The user chopped the onion and potato. Now, the next step is to fry them. So the next action should be to fry the yellow onion first, then the potato. But the game might accept both in one command. However, the user's last action was chopping the potato. So the next step is to fry them. The correct command would be to fry the yellow onion and yellow potato. But the game might require separate actions. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to put them in the stove. But the stove is empty. So the command would be to put the chopped onion and potato into the stove and then fry them. But the exact command structure isn't clear. The recipe says "fry the yellow onion" and "fry the yellow potato". So the user should perform both frying actions. The next action should be to fry the yellow onion first, then the potato. But the user can only input one command at a time. So the next command is to fry the yellow onion.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to fry the yellow onion but the game isn't recognizing "fry" as a verb. Maybe the correct command is to use the stove. The previous actions involved using the knife and chopping. Now, the stove is conventional, so perhaps the action is to put the onion on the stove and then heat it. The game might expect a command like "put yellow onion on stove" or "heat stove". But the recipe says "fry the yellow onion", so maybe the correct command is "fry yellow onion with stove". But the user tried that and it didn't work. Alternatively, maybe the stove needs to be turned on first. The user might need to "turn on stove" before frying. But the initial description said the stove is conventional and empty. So perhaps the correct action is to "fry yellow onion" without specifying the stove, but the game is expecting a different verb. Maybe "cook" instead of "fry"? Or "sear"? Alternatively, the user might need to use the stove's action. Since the user has the knife and the ingredients, the next step is to use the stove. The correct command might be "put yellow onion on stove" or "fry yellow onion". But the game isn't recognizing "fry". Maybe the correct verb is "heat" or "cook". Alternatively, the user might need to "place yellow onion on stove" and then "heat". But the user can only input one command. Given the previous commands, maybe the correct action is "fry yellow onion with stove" but the game doesn't accept that. Alternatively, the user might need to "use stove to fry yellow onion". But the game might require a different phrasing. Since the user is stuck, maybe the correct next action is to "put yellow onion on stove" to start the process.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to fry the yellow onion but the game isn't recognizing the commands. They've tried "fry", "put on stove", "heat", and "use stove to fry". None worked. The recipe says to "fry the yellow onion" and "fry the yellow potato". Maybe the correct command is just "fry yellow onion" even though the game says it's not a verb. Or perhaps the action is to "cook" the onion. Alternatively, since the stove is conventional, maybe the user needs to "turn on stove" first. But the user already put the onion on the stove. Maybe the game expects "cook" instead of "fry". Let me check previous interactions. The user had to "chop" and "take" items. Maybe the correct verb here is "cook". So the next action would be "cook yellow onion". Alternatively, "sear" but that's not in the recipe. The recipe says "fry", so maybe the game has a different term. Alternatively, the user might need to "place" the onion on the stove and then "heat" it. But the user already put it on the stove. Maybe the correct command is "fry yellow onion" despite the error. The user might have to keep trying. So the next action is "fry yellow onion".

Okay, the user is trying to cook the yellow onion but keeps getting errors. They tried "fry" and "cook", but the game didn't recognize them. Then they put the onion on the stove and took it back. Now, they need to figure out the correct command. The recipe says to "fry the yellow onion" and "fry the yellow potato". Maybe the correct action is to use the stove's function. Since the stove is conventional, perhaps the command is "fry yellow onion with stove". But the user tried that before. Alternatively, the game might expect "heat" or "cook".

Okay, the user has successfully fried both the yellow onion and the yellow potato. The next step in the recipe is to "prepare meal". Since the user has all the ingredients cooked, they should now combine them into a meal. The previous steps involved chopping and frying, so the final action is to prepare the meal. The correct command would be "prepare meal" or "serve meal". The game might expect "prepare" as the verb. So the next action is to prepare the meal.

Okay, the user has followed the recipe steps: gathered ingredients, chopped the onion and potato, fried them, and now needs to prepare the meal. The game is stuck because the correct action is "prepare meal" but it's not working. The user has already fried the required items, so the final step is to combine them into a meal. The game might expect the command "serve meal" or "prepare meal". Since "prepare" was tried before and didn't work, maybe "serve" is the correct verb. But the game says "That's not a verb I recognise." Alternatively, the user might need to "put the ingredients together" or "assemble the meal". However, the allowed commands are limited. The correct answer is likely "prepare meal" even if it's not recognized, but the user has to try again. So the next action is "prepare meal".
