-= Bedroom =-
I am excited to announce that you are now in the bedroom. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a bed. The bed appears to be empty.

You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.

Well how about that, you are in a place we're calling a livingroom. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You can see a sofa. The sofa is comfy. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.

You've just shown up in a kitchen.

You make out an opened fridge. The fridge contains a raw red tuna, a raw white tuna, a red hot pepper and a white onion. A fridge... Is that really what you were looking for? You see a closed oven. You scan the room, seeing a table. The table is massive. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? Look over there! a counter. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is an open plain door leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

You've just shown up in a kitchen.

You make out an opened fridge. The fridge is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You see a closed oven. You scan the room, seeing a table. The table is massive. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? Look over there! a counter. On the counter you make out a knife. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is an open plain door leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

You've just shown up in a kitchen.

You make out an opened fridge. The fridge is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You see a closed oven. You scan the room, seeing a table. The table is massive. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? Look over there! a counter. On the counter you make out a knife. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is an open plain door leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

Well how about that, you are in a place we're calling a livingroom. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You can see a sofa. The sofa is comfy. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.
