You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. A normal one.

You make out a fridge. The fridge contains a red onion, a raw pork chop, a red bell pepper, a yellow onion, a carrot, a lettuce and an orange bell pepper. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's an oven. You wonder idly who left that here. You scan the room, seeing a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to a stove. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?
