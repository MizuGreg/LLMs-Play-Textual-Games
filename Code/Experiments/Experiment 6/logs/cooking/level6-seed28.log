-= Bedroom =-
Ah, the bedroom. This is some kind of bedroom, really great usual vibes in this place, a wonderful usual atmosphere. And now, well, you're in it.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a bed. The bed is large. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset.

You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.
