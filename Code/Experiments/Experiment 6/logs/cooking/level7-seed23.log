You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Livingroom =-
You've just walked into a livingroom. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You see a sofa. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a sofa, go to TextWorld. But there isn't a thing on it.

You need an exit without a door? You should try going south. There is an exit to the west.

You arrive in a bedroom.

You see a bed. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door.
