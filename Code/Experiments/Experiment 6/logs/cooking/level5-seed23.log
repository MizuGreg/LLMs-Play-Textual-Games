You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Livingroom =-
Well, here we are in the livingroom.

You see a sofa. But there isn't a thing on it. Silly sofa, silly, empty, good for nothing sofa.

There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. A normal one. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

You make out a fridge. The fridge contains a raw red tuna, a red onion and a raw white tuna. You can see an oven. You can make out a table. The table is massive. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. On the counter you can make out a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a raw yellow potato, a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is an open plain door leading south. There is an exit to the east. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.

You are in a kitchen. A normal one. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

You make out a fridge. The fridge contains a raw red tuna, a red onion and a raw white tuna. You can see an oven. You can make out a table. The table is massive. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. On the counter you can make out a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a raw yellow potato, a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is an open plain door leading south. There is an exit to the east. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.
