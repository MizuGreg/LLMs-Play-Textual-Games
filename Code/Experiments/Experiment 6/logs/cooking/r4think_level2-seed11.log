You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You've just walked into a kitchen.

You can make out a fridge. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper and a carrot. You wonder idly who left that here. You make out a closed oven right there by you. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Silly table, silly, empty, good for nothing table. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a yellow apple, a yellow onion, a green apple, a green hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You scan the room for a stove, and you find a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

Okay, let me figure out what to do next. The user is in a kitchen game where they need to cook a meal. They've already taken the cookbook from the counter. The recipe in the cookbook says to use an orange bell pepper and a yellow apple. The directions are to dice and fry both ingredients.

Looking at the items available in the kitchen: the fridge has an orange bell pepper, red hot pepper, yellow bell pepper, and carrot. The counter has a yellow apple, yellow onion, green apple, green hot pepper, cookbook, and knife. The user has already taken the cookbook, so now they need to gather the ingredients.

The recipe requires the orange bell pepper and yellow apple. The user has the yellow apple since they took the cookbook, but they need to get the orange bell pepper. The fridge is closed, so they need to open it. The next logical step is to go get the orange bell pepper from the fridge. Then, they can proceed to dice and fry it according to the recipe. So the next action should be to open the fridge.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe in the cookbook. So far, they've taken the cookbook, opened the fridge, and picked up the orange bell pepper. The recipe requires dicing and frying both the orange bell pepper and the yellow apple. They already have the yellow apple from the counter, right?

Wait, the user took the cookbook from the counter, and the yellow apple is on the counter. So they probably have the yellow apple. Now, the next step is to dice the orange bell pepper and the yellow apple. But how do they do that? The knife is on the counter. So they need to use the knife to dice the ingredients.

So the next action should be to take the knife from the counter. Then, they can dice both the orange bell pepper and the yellow apple. After dicing, they need to fry them in the oven or stove. But the stove is mentioned as being there, though it's described as a piece of junk. Maybe the oven is the right place to fry them. Wait, the recipe says "fry the orange bell pepper" and "fry the yellow apple". So they need to put them in a pan and heat them. But the user has to use the available tools. The knife is already taken, so next step is to dice the ingredients.

So the next action is to take the knife from the counter. Then, dice both peppers and apples. Then fry them. But the user has to follow the directions step by step. So after getting the knife, they need to dice the orange bell pepper and the yellow apple. Then fry them. So the immediate next step is to take the knife.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to fry the orange bell pepper and the yellow apple according to the recipe. The previous steps involved dicing both ingredients with the knife. Now, they tried to "fry orange bell pepper in oven" but got an error because "fry" isn't a recognized verb here.

Hmm, maybe the correct action is to use the oven. Since the oven is closed, they need to open it first. Then, place the diced pepper inside and heat it. But the recipe says "fry," which might require a stove instead. However, the stove is described as a piece of junk, so maybe the oven is the right place. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the stove's burner. But the game might have specific commands.

Wait, the user has the knife, the diced ingredients, and the oven is closed. The correct steps would be to open the oven, put the diced pepper in, and then heat it. But the error was with "fry." Maybe the correct verb is "put" or "place" in the oven. Alternatively, maybe "heat" is the verb. Let me check the previous actions. The user had to "dice" the ingredients, so maybe "fry" is not the right verb here. Perhaps the correct action is to "put the diced orange bell pepper in the oven" and then "heat it." But the game might require specific commands. Since the oven is closed, first open it, then put the ingredients in. Then maybe "heat" or "fry" is the next step. But the user tried "fry" and it didn't work. So maybe the correct action is to "put" the diced pepper into the oven after opening it. Let's try that.

But the stove is described as a piece of junk, so perhaps the oven is the right place. However, the previous action was putting the orange bell pepper into the oven.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal in the kitchen game. They've followed the recipe steps: gathered ingredients, diced the orange bell pepper and yellow apple, and put both into the oven. Now, they need to make the meal ready. The recipe says to "fry" the ingredients, but the oven is the only cooking appliance available. The user tried "heat oven" and "wait for oven to heat", but those weren't recognized as verbs.

Hmm, maybe the correct action is to "close the oven" after putting the ingredients in, since it was open earlier. Or perhaps "turn on the oven" or "start the oven". But the game might expect a specific command. Since the oven is already open and the ingredients are inside, maybe the next step is to "open the oven" again, but that's already done. Wait, the user has to follow the recipe's directions. The recipe says "fry the orange bell pepper" and "fry the yellow apple". Since the oven is the only place, maybe the user needs to "heat the oven" or "turn on the oven". But the game doesn't recognize "heat" or "turn on". Alternatively, maybe the correct verb is "put" again, but that's already done. Wait, maybe the user needs to "close the oven" to trap the heat. But the oven was opened earlier. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "wait" for the oven to heat up, but "wait" isn't a verb here. The user is stuck because the commands aren't working. The correct next step might be to "close the oven" to finish cooking. Let me check the previous steps again. The user put both ingredients into the oven. The next step is to close it to let the heat do the work. So the command would be "close oven".

Okay, let's see. The user is in a kitchen game where they need to cook a meal. They followed the recipe steps: gathered ingredients, diced the orange bell pepper and yellow apple, and put both into the oven. Then they closed the oven, but the game didn't recognize that. Now, they opened the oven again and saw the diced ingredients inside.

The next step according to the recipe is to fry the ingredients. But the oven is the only cooking appliance here. The user might need to "heat" the oven or "start" the cooking process. However, the game's previous commands didn't accept "heat" or "start". Alternatively, maybe the correct action is to "take" the cooked ingredients from the oven. But the user hasn't cooked them yet. Wait, the recipe says "fry", which might require a stove, but the stove is described as a piece of junk. Maybe the oven is the right place. Since the oven is open, the user might need to "put" the ingredients into the oven again, but they're already there. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "close" the oven to trap the heat. But the oven was already closed. Hmm. The user has to follow the recipe's directions. The next step after putting the ingredients in the oven is to cook them. Since the oven is open, maybe the correct action is to "close" it again to finish cooking. But the game didn't recognize "close" earlier. Wait, the user just opened the oven again, and the ingredients are inside. Maybe the next step is to "take" the cooked meal from the oven. But the user hasn't cooked it yet. Alternatively, maybe the game expects the user to "eat" the meal. But the original goal is to enjoy the meal. So the final step is to take the cooked ingredients from the oven and eat them. The correct command would be "take cooked meal from oven" or something similar. But the game might use "eat" as the command. However, the user needs to follow the recipe's steps. Since the oven is open and the ingredients are there, maybe the user needs to "close" the oven again to let the heat do the work. But the game didn't recognize "close" earlier. Alternatively, the user might need to "heat" the oven, but that's not a recognized verb. The correct next action is probably to "eat" the meal, but the user has to make sure it's cooked. So the final step is to take the ingredients from the oven and eat them. The command would be "eat meal" or "take meal from oven". But the game might expect "eat".

You can't use multiple objects with that verb.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to eat the orange bell pepper and yellow apple. The game says they can't use multiple objects with the "eat" verb. So maybe they need to eat them one at a time. Earlier, they took both items from the oven. The correct command would be to eat each item separately. So first, eat the orange bell pepper, then the yellow apple. But the game might require the exact command format. The user tried "eat orange bell pepper and yellow apple" which didn't work. So the next step is to eat one item at a time. The correct commands would be "eat orange bell pepper" followed by "eat yellow apple". Let me check the previous steps. The user took both items from the oven. Now, they need to eat them individually. So the next action is to eat the orange bell pepper first.
