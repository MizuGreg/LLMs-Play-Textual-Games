You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Bedroom =-
If you're wondering why everything seems so standard all of a sudden, it's because you've just sauntered into the bedroom. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

Look over there! a bed. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Hm. Oh well

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they've been moving through different rooms: bedroom, living room, corridor, bathroom, and back and forth. The original goal was to cook a meal by checking the cookbook in the kitchen. But so far, the player has been moving between rooms without ever entering the kitchen.

The current location is the corridor again, with exits to north, south, and west. The user has been repeatedly going west and east, which leads them between the bathroom and corridor. The problem is that the kitchen hasn't been accessed yet. The cookbook is in the kitchen, so the next logical step is to find the kitchen.

Looking at the previous movements, the player has been moving west from the corridor to the bathroom and back. The corridor's description mentions an exit to the north, but the user hasn't tried that. However, the user's previous actions have been following the advice to go west when prompted, which keeps them looping between bathroom and corridor. 

To reach the kitchen, the player needs to find a path that leads to the kitchen. Since the kitchen hasn't been mentioned yet, maybe the kitchen is accessible from the corridor's north exit. Alternatively, maybe the kitchen is in a different part of the house. But given the current room descriptions, the only way to proceed is to explore the available exits.

The user is currently in the corridor. The available exits are north, south, and west. The user has been going west, which leads to the bathroom. The south exit hasn't been explored yet. Maybe the south exit leads to the kitchen. Alternatively, the north exit might lead to another room. But the user hasn't tried going north yet.

Wait, in the corridor's description, the user is told to try going south or west if they need an exit without a door. The north exit is mentioned as existing but not blocked by a door. However, the user hasn't tried going north yet. Maybe the kitchen is north of the corridor. Alternatively, the user might need to go south from the corridor to reach the kitchen.

But since the user has been stuck in a loop between the bathroom and corridor, perhaps the kitchen is accessible via the south exit. Alternatively, maybe the kitchen is in the north. However, the user needs to try different directions to find the kitchen.

Given that the user's goal is to find the cookbook in the kitchen, the next step is to explore the available exits. Since the user has been going west (to bathroom) and back, maybe trying the north exit would be the next logical step. But the user's previous actions have been following the advice to go west, which might not be leading them towards the kitchen.

Alternatively, maybe the kitchen is accessible from the living room or bedroom. But the user hasn't checked those rooms for a kitchen. However, the initial prompt mentioned the kitchen as the place with the cookbook. So the user needs to find the kitchen.

In the current corridor, the user has to decide between north, south, or west. Since the user has been going west, perhaps trying the north exit is the way to go. But the user's previous action was going west again. However, the user is now at corridor 15, and the next step should be to try a different direction to reach the kitchen.

Alternatively, maybe the kitchen is in the south direction from the corridor. The user hasn't tried that yet. So the next action should be to go south from the corridor to check if that leads to the kitchen.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the corridor, bathroom, and living room. They've been moving back and forth without finding the kitchen where the cookbook is. The original goal was to cook a meal by checking the cookbook in the kitchen. So far, the user hasn't entered the kitchen yet.

Looking at the current room, they're in the living room again. The exits are north and west. The user has been going west to the bedroom and then east back to the living room. The corridor is north, but the user hasn't tried going north from here. Maybe the kitchen is north of the living room. But the corridor's description says going north from there leads to another corridor, which the user has already explored.

Wait, the user has been going back and forth between the corridor, bathroom, and living room. The kitchen hasn't been mentioned in any of these rooms. Maybe the kitchen is in a different part of the house that's not yet explored. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to find a different path. But all the exits from the current rooms lead back to the same areas.

The user's actions so far have been repetitive, moving west and east between the bathroom and corridor, then to the living room. The next logical step would be to try going north from the living room to the corridor again, but that's already been done. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to find a way to exit the building, but the goal is to find the kitchen, not escape.

Wait, the initial prompt said the user is hungry and needs to cook a meal by checking the cookbook in the kitchen. The user hasn't found the kitchen yet. Maybe the kitchen is in the north exit of the corridor, but the user hasn't tried that. However, the user has been avoiding the north exit because the corridor's description says to try south or west. But maybe the kitchen is north of the corridor.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check all possible exits again. Since the user is in the living room, going north to the corridor again, then maybe trying south from there. But the user has already done that. It's possible that the game is designed to loop until the user finds the kitchen, but the user hasn't found it yet.

The next action should be to try going north from the living room to the corridor again, hoping that maybe the kitchen is there. But the user has been going north and south multiple times. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check the west exit from the living room, which leads to the bedroom, but that's been explored.

Wait, the user is in the living room again. The exits are north and west. The user has been going west to the bedroom and back. The north exit leads to the corridor. Maybe the user needs to go north again to the corridor and then try a different direction. But the user has already done that. It's possible that the kitchen is in the north corridor, but the user hasn't checked there yet.

So, the next step is to go north from the living room to the corridor again, then maybe try south or west from there. But the user has been doing that. Maybe the user needs to try a different approach. However, based on the previous interactions, the only available exits are the ones mentioned. The user might be stuck in a loop, but the goal is to find the kitchen. Since the user hasn't found it yet, the next action should be to continue exploring the available exits, even if it's repetitive. So, the next command would be to go north from the living room to the corridor again.

You arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a fridge. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You scan the room for a table, and you find a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a yellow apple, a raw purple potato, a tomato, a red apple, a raw red potato, a raw yellow potato, a green apple, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife. Were you looking for a stove? Because look over there, it's a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is a closed frosted-glass door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

Okay, the user is in the kitchen and has been collecting items from the fridge. They took a carrot, lettuce, two bell peppers, and now a yellow apple. But they can't carry more than a certain number. The goal is to cook a meal, so they need ingredients. They have some vegetables and fruits. Maybe they should drop one item to carry another. The next step could be to drop the lettuce to make space and take the yellow apple. Alternatively, maybe they need to use the knife or cook the items. But since they're carrying too much, dropping an item is necessary. The user might need to focus on gathering the necessary ingredients without overloading. So, the next action should be to drop the lettuce to take the apple.

Okay, the user is in the kitchen and has been trying to collect ingredients. They've picked up a yellow apple, a carrot, a green bell pepper, and a red bell pepper. But they can only carry so much. The goal is to cook a meal, so they need to use the ingredients. The user has been dropping items to make space but keeps picking them up again. Maybe they need to focus on using the items they have instead of collecting more. The next step could be to use the knife to prepare the ingredients or go to the stove to cook. Since the stove is mentioned, maybe they should try using it. But the user is carrying too many items. Alternatively, they might need to drop one item to carry another. The user has already dropped the red bell pepper, so maybe they can take the apple and carrot and cook with those. The next action should be to go to the stove to start cooking.
