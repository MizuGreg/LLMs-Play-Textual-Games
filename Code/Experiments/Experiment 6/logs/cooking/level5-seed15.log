You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Livingroom =-
You've just shown up in a livingroom.

You can make out a sofa. The sofa is comfy. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

There is an exit to the north. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.

GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Corridor =-
You arrive in a corridor. An ordinary one.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door. There is an exit to the west.

GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You can make out an opened fridge, which looks conventional, nearby. The fridge contains a raw white tuna, a white onion, a raw pork chop and a yellow onion! You see an oven. You see a table. You wonder idly who left that here. The table is massive. But the thing is empty. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. There's something about an object in a room that's just so... TextWorld. You see a red hot pepper, a raw red tuna, a red bell pepper, a green hot pepper, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is an open frosted-glass door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

You are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You can make out an opened fridge, which looks conventional, nearby. The fridge contains a raw white tuna, a white onion, a raw pork chop and a yellow onion! You see an oven. You see a table. You wonder idly who left that here. The table is massive. But the thing is empty. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. There's something about an object in a room that's just so... TextWorld. You see a raw red tuna, a red bell pepper, a green hot pepper, a raw red potato and a cookbook on the counter. What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is an open frosted-glass door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.
