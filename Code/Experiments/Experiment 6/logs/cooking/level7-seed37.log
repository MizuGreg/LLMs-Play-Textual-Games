You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Bedroom =-
I am excited to announce that you are now in the bedroom. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a bed. The bed appears to be empty.

You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.

-= Livingroom =-
Well how about that, you are in a place we're calling a livingroom. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You can see a sofa. The sofa is comfy. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.

-= Kitchen =-
Look at that notice! What does it say? It says Welcome to the kitchen? Well that's cool. The room is well lit.

You make out a closed fridge. You make out a closed oven. You make out a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh, great. Here's a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper, a red apple, a green hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife. You can see a stove. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What's the point of an empty stove?

There is a closed plain door leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.
