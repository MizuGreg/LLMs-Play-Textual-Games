You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Backyard =-
Guess what, you are in a place we're calling a backyard. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a patio table. The patio table is stylish. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a patio chair. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make out a closed BBQ in the room.

There is a closed wooden door leading east. There is a closed screen door leading west. There is an exit to the north.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me think through this. The user is trying to cook a meal by gathering ingredients. So far, they've collected a tomato and lettuce from the garden and placed them on the patio table in the backyard. They've also explored the shed but didn't find anything useful there.

The next step would be to find more ingredients or tools needed for cooking. The shed has a toolbox and workbench, maybe there's something useful there. But the user already went west from the shed and came back. The BBQ is closed in the backyard, maybe they need to open it. Alternatively, maybe they need to find a recipe or a way to prepare the ingredients.

Wait, the original instruction was to check the cookbook in the kitchen. But the user is currently in the backyard. The kitchen isn't mentioned yet. Maybe they need to go back to the kitchen through the north exit. But the user has been going between the garden, backyard, and shed. The kitchen might be another location. However, the current location is the backyard. The north exit leads to the garden again. Maybe the user needs to find the kitchen through another path. Alternatively, maybe the BBQ needs to be opened to cook the ingredients. The user has the tomato and lettuce, so maybe they need to use the BBQ to cook them. But the BBQ is closed. So the next action should be to open the BBQ. Let me check the previous steps. In the backyard, there's a closed BBQ. The user hasn't interacted with it yet. So the next logical step is to open the BBQ to cook the meal. Therefore, the command should be to open the BBQ.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal using the tomato and lettuce they collected. They opened the BBQ, but now they need to use it to cook the ingredients. The previous attempt was "cook meal with tomato and lettuce", which didn't work. Then they tried "use bbq on tomato and lettuce", which also failed.

Hmm, maybe the correct command is to put the ingredients on the BBQ. Since the BBQ is closed, maybe they need to open it first, but they already did. Wait, the BBQ is closed, so perhaps they need to interact with it differently. Or maybe the game expects a specific verb like "grill" or "cook" followed by the item. Alternatively, maybe they need to place the tomato and lettuce on the BBQ first. Let me check the previous steps again.

The user has the tomato and lettuce on the patio table. The BBQ is closed. They opened it. Now, maybe the next step is to put the ingredients on the BBQ. The correct command might be "put tomato on bbq" and "put lettuce on bbq". But the user tried "use bbq on tomato and lettuce" which wasn't recognized. Maybe the correct action is to use the BBQ to cook the items once they're placed on it. Alternatively, maybe the game expects a command like "cook tomato" or "cook lettuce" using the BBQ. But since the user has both items, perhaps they need to place both on the BBQ first. Let me think of the possible commands. The user might need to "put tomato on bbq" and "put lettuce on bbq" separately. But the user tried to use the BBQ on the items, which didn't work. So maybe the correct action is to place the items on the BBQ. Let me check the available actions again. The user is in the backyard, with the BBQ open. The correct command would be to put the tomato and lettuce on the BBQ. So the next action should be "put tomato on bbq" and then "put lettuce on bbq". But the user might need to do them one at a time. Alternatively, maybe the game expects a single command like "cook meal with tomato and lettuce" but that didn't work. Alternatively, maybe "grill tomato and lettuce on bbq". But the game didn't recognize "use bbq on..." so maybe the correct command is to put the items on the BBQ. So the next step is to put the tomato on the BBQ.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal using the tomato and lettuce they collected. They've placed both items on the BBQ, but the game says putting them on the BBQ achieves nothing. The previous attempts to use the BBQ on the items didn't work. Maybe the correct action is to actually cook them using the BBQ. Since the BBQ is open, maybe the command is to cook the meal with the ingredients. But the user tried "cook meal with tomato and lettuce" earlier, which didn't work. Alternatively, maybe the game expects a specific verb like "grill" or "cook" followed by the items. Since the user has both items on the BBQ, perhaps the next step is to use the BBQ to cook them. The correct command might be "cook tomato and lettuce with bbq" or something similar. But the game didn't recognize "use bbq on..." so maybe the correct action is to use the BBQ directly. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to interact with the BBQ in a different way. Since the BBQ is closed, but the user already opened it, maybe the next step is to cook the meal. The original goal was to check the cookbook in the kitchen, but the user hasn't done that yet. Wait, the user is in the backyard, and the kitchen might be another location. But the current location is the backyard. Maybe the user needs to go to the kitchen through the north exit. But the user has been going back and forth. Alternatively, maybe the correct action is to cook the meal using the ingredients and the BBQ. The game might expect the command "cook meal" or "grill meal" with the items. Since the user has the items on the BBQ, maybe the correct command is "cook meal" or "grill meal". Let me check the previous steps again. The user tried "use bbq on tomato and lettuce" which didn't work. Maybe the correct command is "cook tomato and lettuce" or "grill tomato and lettuce". Alternatively, since the BBQ is open, maybe the user needs to put the items on it and then cook them. But the game says putting them on the BBQ achieves nothing. So maybe the correct action is to use the BBQ to cook the meal. The next step is to try "cook meal with tomato and lettuce" again, even though it didn't work before. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the BBQ as the cooking tool. The correct command might be "use bbq to cook tomato and lettuce". But the game didn't recognize "use bbq on...". Maybe the correct verb is "cook" instead of "use". So the next action should be "cook tomato and lettuce" or "cook meal with tomato and lettuce". Let me try that.
