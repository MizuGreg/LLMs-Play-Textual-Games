You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

Well, here we are in a kitchen.

You see an opened fridge. The fridge is empty! What a waste of a day! You see an oven, so there's that. Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a raw yellow potato, a red hot pepper, a red bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a yellow apple, a raw red potato and a knife. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.

There is an open plain door leading south. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a kitchen, and the goal is to cook a meal. The initial action was to look at the cookbook, but that didn't work. Now, they need to figure out the next steps.

First, the kitchen has a fridge (empty), an oven, a table with a cookbook, a counter with various ingredients like potatoes, peppers, apples, and a knife. The stove is empty. The user needs to find a recipe and cook something.

Since the cookbook wasn't visible, maybe it's in a different location. Wait, the user saw a cookbook on the table. Maybe they didn't check it properly. Or maybe the cookbook is in another place. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the ingredients available to make a meal without the cookbook. But the prompt says to check the cookbook first.

Wait, the user tried to look at the cookbook but couldn't. Maybe the cookbook is not on the table? Let me check the description again. The table is massive, and on it, the user sees a cookbook. So the cookbook is there. Maybe the user needs to take it. The previous action was "look at the cookbook in the kitchen", but the response was "You can't see any such thing." That's confusing because the description says the cookbook is on the table. Maybe the user needs to check the table again or take the cookbook.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the ingredients to cook something. Since the oven is present, maybe they can use it. But the recipe is needed. Wait, the user is supposed to check the cookbook. Maybe the problem is that the user didn't take the cookbook. So the next step should be to take the cookbook from the table. Let me check the available actions. The user can pick up items. So the correct action would be to take the cookbook. Then, once the cookbook is in hand, they can proceed to follow the recipe.

But the user's previous action was looking at the cookbook, which didn't work. Maybe the correct action is to take the cookbook instead of looking at it. So the next step is to take the cookbook from the table.

GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Okay, let's see. The user is in a kitchen game where they need to cook a meal. They started by looking for a cookbook, found it on the table, and took it. Now they're at step 0/2. The next logical step would be to check the cookbook's contents to find a recipe. Since the cookbook is in hand, the next action should be to open it. But the user might need to interact with the cookbook first. Wait, the previous action was taking the cookbook, so the next step is probably to open it to see the recipes. The game might require opening the cookbook to find the ingredients needed. So the next command should be to open the cookbook.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal in the kitchen. They found the cookbook on the table, but it's not opening. So the next step would be to figure out what to do with the cookbook. Since it's a recipe, maybe they need to look at the ingredients listed. But the cookbook isn't opening, so maybe they need to check the contents without opening it? Or perhaps there's another item they need to use with the cookbook.

Looking at the kitchen items: there's a knife, potatoes, peppers, apples. The user has the cookbook. Maybe they need to use the cookbook to find a recipe, then gather the ingredients. But since the cookbook isn't opening, maybe they need to check the table for ingredients. Wait, the user already took the cookbook. Maybe the next step is to check the ingredients listed in the cookbook, but since it's not opening, perhaps they need to look at the cookbook's contents in another way. Alternatively, maybe they need to use the knife on something. But the goal is to cook a meal, so the steps would be: get ingredients, follow the recipe, cook.

Wait, the user is in the kitchen, has the cookbook, but can't open it. Maybe the next action is to look at the cookbook's pages, but since it's not opening, maybe they need to check the ingredients on the table. The table has potatoes, peppers, apples. Maybe the recipe requires those. So the user needs to take the ingredients. But the user hasn't taken any yet. So maybe the next step is to take an ingredient, like a potato, and then use the cookbook to find the recipe. But the cookbook isn't opening. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the cookbook to find a recipe, but since it's not opening, maybe they need to check the cookbook's contents in another way. Or perhaps the user needs to look at the cookbook's pages, but since it's not opening, maybe they need to check the ingredients on the table. Wait, the user is supposed to follow the recipe from the cookbook. So maybe the next step is to look at the cookbook's pages, but since it's not opening, maybe they need to check the ingredients listed in the cookbook. But how? Maybe the user needs to use the cookbook to find the recipe, but since it's not opening, maybe they need to check the ingredients on the table. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the knife on something. But the goal is to cook, so the user needs to gather ingredients and follow the recipe. Since the cookbook isn't opening, maybe the user needs to check the ingredients on the table. So the next action would be to take an ingredient, like a potato, and then use the cookbook to find the recipe. But the user hasn't taken any ingredients yet. So the next step is to take an ingredient. Let's see, the user is in the kitchen, has the cookbook, but can't open it. So maybe the next action is to take a potato from the table. But the user hasn't taken any ingredients yet. So the next action is to take the potato. But the user's previous action was opening the cookbook, which didn't work. So maybe the next step is to take an ingredient. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to look at the cookbook's pages, but since it's not opening, maybe they need to check the ingredients on the table. So the next action is to take a potato. But the user hasn't taken any yet. So the answer would be to take the potato. But the user's previous action was open the cookbook, which didn't work. So maybe the next step is to take an ingredient.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal in the kitchen. They started by looking for the cookbook, which they found on the table. Then they tried to open it but couldn't. Now they took a raw yellow potato. The score increased by one.

Hmm, the goal is to cook a delicious meal. So far, they've gathered some ingredients. The cookbook might have a recipe that requires specific items. The user has the potato, but maybe they need more ingredients. Let's check the items available. The counter has a raw yellow potato, red hot pepper, red bell pepper, yellow bell pepper, yellow apple, raw red potato, and a knife. The user has the yellow potato. Maybe they need to collect other ingredients from the counter. The next step could be to take another ingredient, like a bell pepper or a pepper. Alternatively, maybe they need to use the knife to prepare the potato. But since the cookbook wasn't openable, maybe they need to find another way. Wait, the user is at 1/4 points. Maybe they need to collect four ingredients? Or follow the recipe steps. Since the cookbook wasn't openable, maybe the recipe is in the cookbook, but they need to interact with it differently. Alternatively, maybe the next step is to use the ingredients they have. But the user has only taken the potato. So perhaps the next action is to take another ingredient, like a bell pepper. Let's think: the user has the potato, so maybe they need to cook it. But the stove is empty. Maybe they need to put the potato on the stove. But the user hasn't used the stove yet. Alternatively, maybe they need to use the knife to cut the potato. But the user hasn't done that yet. However, the previous action was taking the potato, so the next logical step might be to use the knife. But the user hasn't taken the knife yet. Wait, the counter has a knife. So maybe the user should take the knife next. But the user is at 1/4 points. Maybe they need to collect four ingredients. Let me check the items again. The counter has: raw yellow potato, red hot pepper, red bell pepper, yellow bell pepper, yellow apple, raw red potato, and a knife. The user has taken the yellow potato. So maybe they need to take other ingredients. The recipe might require multiple vegetables. So the next step could be to take another ingredient, like a red bell pepper. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the knife on the potato. But the user hasn't taken the knife yet. So perhaps the next action is to take the knife. But the user's previous action was taking the potato. Alternatively, maybe the user should take another ingredient. Let's think about the game's progression. The user needs to cook a meal, so they need ingredients and maybe follow a recipe. Since the cookbook wasn't openable, maybe the user needs to find another way. But the user has the potato. Maybe the next step is to use the stove. But the stove is empty. So perhaps the user needs to put the potato on the stove. But the user hasn't done that yet. Alternatively, maybe they need to use the knife to prepare the potato. But the user hasn't taken the knife. So the next action should be to take the knife. But the user hasn't done that yet. Alternatively, take another ingredient. The user has the potato, so maybe they need to take another item. Let's check the possible actions. The user is in the kitchen, so possible actions are taking items from the counter, using the knife, or using the stove. Since the user has the potato, maybe the next step is to use the knife on it. But the user hasn't taken the knife. So the next action should be to take the knife. But the user's previous action was taking the potato. So the next action is to take the knife. But the user hasn't done that yet. Alternatively, maybe the user should take another ingredient. Let me think again. The user's score is 1/4. Maybe they need to collect four ingredients. So they have the potato, and need three more. So next, take another ingredient, like a red bell pepper. So the next action is to take the red bell pepper. Alternatively, take the knife. But the user hasn't taken the knife yet. The knife is on the counter. So maybe the next action is to take the knife. But the user is at 1/4. Maybe the user needs to take the knife to prepare the potato. So the next action is to take the knife. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the answer is take the knife. But the user's previous action was taking the potato. So the next action is take the knife. But the user hasn't taken it yet. Alternatively, maybe the user should take another ingredient. Let me check the possible items again. The counter has a knife, so taking the knife is possible. So the next action is to take the knife. But the user hasn't done that yet.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal in the kitchen. So far, they've taken the cookbook, but couldn't open it. Then they took a potato and a knife, chopped the potato. Now they need to proceed.

The goal is to cook a delicious meal, so the next step would be to use the ingredients they have. They have a chopped potato, maybe they need to cook it. The oven is in the kitchen, so maybe they should put the potato in the oven. But wait, the user has other ingredients like peppers and apples. Maybe they need to make a dish that uses multiple ingredients.

But the cookbook wasn't opened, so maybe they need to find a recipe. However, the user already took the cookbook. Maybe the next step is to look for a recipe in the cookbook. But earlier, they couldn't open it. Maybe they need to find a way to open it. Alternatively, since they have the ingredients, they can start cooking.

The user has a knife, potato, and other veggies. Maybe they need to prepare a dish like a potato dish with peppers. Since the oven is available, perhaps they should put the chopped potato in the oven. But the user needs to check the cookbook for the recipe. However, the cookbook wasn't opened. Maybe the next step is to open the cookbook again, but the user tried that before. Alternatively, maybe they can use the ingredients they have to make a meal without the recipe. But the game might require following the recipe.

Wait, the original instruction said to check the cookbook for the recipe. So maybe the user needs to find the recipe first. But they couldn't open it. Maybe they need to look through the cookbook. Alternatively, maybe the cookbook is a book that can be read, so they need to open it. But the user tried that and it wasn't possible. Maybe the cookbook is a puzzle. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the ingredients they have to make a meal, even without the recipe.

But the game's goal is to cook a meal, so the user needs to use the ingredients. They have a potato, peppers, apples, and a knife. Maybe they can chop the peppers and apples, then cook them. But the user has already chopped the potato. Maybe the next step is to chop the peppers. So the user should take the red hot pepper and chop it with the knife. Then, maybe cook the ingredients in the oven. Alternatively, use the stove, but the stove is empty.

So the next action could be to chop another ingredient, like the red hot pepper. That makes sense. So the user should take the red hot pepper and chop it with the knife. Then, maybe put the chopped ingredients into the oven. But the user needs to check the cookbook for the recipe. However, the cookbook wasn't opened. Maybe the user needs to find a way to open it again. But the previous attempt failed. Alternatively, maybe the user can proceed to cook without the recipe.

But the game might require following the recipe. So maybe the user needs to find the recipe in the cookbook. Since the user took the cookbook, maybe they need to open it. But the game said it isn't something you can open. Maybe the user needs to look through it. Alternatively, maybe the user can use the ingredients they have to make a meal. So the next step is to chop the peppers. Let's go with that.

The goal is to cook a delicious meal, so the next step would likely be to use the ingredients they've gathered. They have a potato, a hot pepper, and a knife. Maybe they need to chop the pepper next.

But the stove is there, but it's empty. Maybe they need to cook the potato and pepper on the stove. But the user has a knife, so maybe chopping the pepper is the next step.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal in the kitchen. So far, they've taken the cookbook, but couldn't open it. Then they started gathering ingredients: potato, knife, hot pepper. They chopped both the potato and the hot pepper. Now, the score is 4/9.

The original goal was to cook a delicious meal, so the next step would be to use the ingredients they've prepared. Since they have a potato and a hot pepper, maybe they need to cook them. But the oven is mentioned, so perhaps they need to put the chopped ingredients into the oven. But the user hasn't used the oven yet. Also, there are other vegetables on the counter: red bell pepper, yellow bell pepper, apple. Maybe the recipe requires more ingredients. But the cookbook wasn't opened, so maybe the user needs to find the recipe steps. However, the user couldn't open the cookbook earlier. Wait, maybe the cookbook is a clue. Alternatively, since the user has chopped two items, maybe they need to cook them. But the stove is mentioned, but it's empty. Maybe they need to put the chopped potato and pepper into the stove or oven. But the user hasn't done that yet. The next logical step would be to cook the ingredients. So the action would be to put them in the oven or on the stove. But the user has to use the knife and the ingredients. Since they have the knife, maybe they need to cut more ingredients. But they already have the potato and hot pepper. Alternatively, maybe they need to combine the ingredients. But the user is at 4/9, so maybe they need to proceed to cook. The possible next action is to put the chopped items into the oven. But the user hasn't used the oven yet. So the next action would be to put the chopped potato and hot pepper into the oven. But the game might require specific commands. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to find the recipe steps from the cookbook, but since it couldn't be opened earlier, maybe they need to try again. However, the user has already taken the cookbook. Maybe the next step is to use the ingredients to cook. So the answer is to cook the ingredients. But the available actions are to use the oven or stove. Since the stove is empty, maybe the user needs to put the chopped items on the stove. But the command would be something like "put the chopped potato in the oven" or "cook the potato". But the game might require specific commands. Alternatively, since the user has the knife, maybe they need to cut another ingredient. But they already have the hot pepper. The user might need to proceed to cook. So the next action is to cook the chopped items. But the exact command depends on the game's mechanics. The user has the knife and the ingredients, so the next step is to cook them. Therefore, the next action is to cook the potato and hot pepper.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook the chopped yellow potato and red hot pepper in the oven. But the system says you can't use multiple objects with that verb. So, maybe the action needs to be done one at a time.

First, I should check what the valid actions are. The user has the knife, the chopped potato, and the chopped pepper. The oven is available. Maybe the correct approach is to cook each item separately. 

But the system might require specific commands. Maybe "cook the chopped yellow potato in the oven" and then "cook the chopped red hot pepper in the oven" as two separate actions. Since the user can't do both at once, they need to handle them individually. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to put each ingredient into the oven one by one. So the next step would be to cook one of them first, then the other. The system's error message suggests that using "cook" with multiple objects isn't allowed. So the correct action is to cook one item at a time. 

Therefore, the next action should be to cook the chopped yellow potato in the oven. Then, after that's done, proceed to cook the red hot pepper. But since the user can only do one action at a time, the immediate next step is to cook the potato first.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal in the kitchen. They've already taken some ingredients, chopped the potato and red hot pepper, and cooked the potato. Now, the next step would likely be to cook the red hot pepper. But the user tried to cook both at once and got an error. So, they need to handle each item separately.

The user just cooked the yellow potato, so the next logical step is to cook the red hot pepper. The oven is available, so using "cook the red hot pepper in the oven" should work. That makes sense because the previous action was successful for the potato, and the error was trying to cook both together. So, the correct command would be to cook the red hot pepper individually.
