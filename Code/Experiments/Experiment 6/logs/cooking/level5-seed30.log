You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Pantry =-
You arrive in a pantry. An usual one.

You see a shelf. But there isn't a thing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is an open plain door leading west.

GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.

You can make out an opened conventional looking fridge in the room. The fridge contains a raw pork chop and a red onion. You make out a closed oven. You can make out a table. The table appears to be empty. You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a red hot pepper, a raw red tuna, a yellow bell pepper, a green hot pepper, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a stove. But the thing is empty.

There is an open plain door leading east. You need an exit without a door? You should try going north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door.
