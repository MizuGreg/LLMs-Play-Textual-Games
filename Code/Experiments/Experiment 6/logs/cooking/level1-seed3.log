You've entered a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

You see a fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop and a lettuce! You can make out a closed conventional looking oven close by. You can see a table. You see a knife on the table. You can see a counter. On the counter you can see a cookbook. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a kitchen game where they need to cook a meal. They tried to open the cookbook but couldn't. The fridge has a pork chop and lettuce, there's a knife, a stove, and an oven. The user is hungry and needs to follow a recipe.

First, the cookbook is closed, so maybe they need to find another way to get the recipe. Since the cookbook is on the counter, maybe they can look for clues there. Alternatively, maybe the recipe is implied by the ingredients available. The user has a pork chop and lettuce, which are ingredients for a dish like pork chop with lettuce, maybe a salad or a sandwich. But the game might require following a specific recipe.

Since the cookbook is closed, perhaps the user needs to find another way to proceed. The knife is on the table, so maybe they need to use that to prepare the pork chop. The stove is empty, so maybe they need to heat something up. But without the recipe, it's hard to know the exact steps. The user might need to use the available ingredients and tools to make a meal, even if the recipe isn't explicitly in the cookbook. So the next step could be to use the knife on the pork chop to prepare it, then cook it on the stove. Alternatively, check the oven if it's available. But the oven is closed, so maybe they need to open it first. Wait, the user tried to open the cookbook but couldn't. Maybe the cookbook is a clue, but since it's closed, perhaps they need to find another way. Alternatively, maybe the recipe is in the description of the items. For example, the pork chop and lettuce could be used to make a pork salad. So the next action might be to use the knife on the pork chop to chop it, then cook it on the stove. But the user needs to follow the game's logic. Since the cookbook is closed, maybe they need to look for another way to get the recipe. Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to use the ingredients and tools available to make a meal without the recipe. So the next step could be to use the knife on the pork chop to prepare it, then cook it on the stove. Let me check the available items again. The user has a knife, pork chop, lettuce, stove, oven, fridge. The stove is empty, so maybe they need to put the pork chop on it. But the user needs to cook it. So the next action could be to use the knife on the pork chop to chop it, then put it on the stove. But the user might need to first get the pork chop from the fridge. Wait, the pork chop is already in the fridge. So the user can take it. But the user hasn't done that yet. So maybe the next step is to take the pork chop from the fridge, then chop it with the knife, then cook it on the stove. But the user is in the kitchen, so they can take the pork chop. However, the user's previous action was trying to open the cookbook, which didn't work. So maybe the next step is to take the pork chop from the fridge. But the user is already in the kitchen, so they can take it. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the knife on the pork chop to prepare it. But the user hasn't taken the pork chop yet. So the next action should be to take the pork chop from the fridge. Wait, the user is in the kitchen, and the fridge has the pork chop. So the user can take it. Then use the knife to chop it. Then cook it on the stove. But the user needs to follow the game's commands. The user's last action was trying to open the cookbook, which didn't work. So the next step is to take the pork chop from the fridge. But the user might need to first check the fridge. Alternatively, maybe the user can use the knife on the pork chop directly. But the pork chop is in the fridge. So the user needs to take it first. So the next action is to take the pork chop from the fridge. Then use the knife on it. Then cook it on the stove. But the user needs to make sure they have the ingredients. Alternatively, maybe the user can use the lettuce and pork chop to make a salad. But the game might require cooking. So the next step is to take the pork chop from the fridge. Let me check the game's environment again. The user sees the fridge with a raw pork chop and lettuce. So the user can take the pork chop. Then use the knife to chop it. Then put it on the stove. But the stove is empty. So the user can put the pork chop on the stove and cook it. But the user needs to follow the steps. So the next action is to take the pork chop from the fridge. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the correct next action is to take the pork chop from the fridge. But the user's previous action was trying to open the cookbook. So the next action should be to take the pork chop. However, the user might need to first check the fridge. Alternatively, the user can take the pork chop directly. So the next action is "take pork chop from fridge".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal in this text adventure. They started by opening the cookbook, but it wasn't possible. Then they took the pork chop from the fridge. Now they need to proceed.

The goal is to make a delicious meal, so they need to follow a recipe. The cookbook was in the kitchen, but they couldn't open it. Maybe they need to find another way to get the recipe. Wait, maybe the cookbook is closed, so they need to open it first. But earlier, the user tried to open it and it wasn't possible. Maybe the cookbook is a book that needs to be opened with a specific action.

Alternatively, maybe the recipe is in the cookbook, so once they have the pork chop and lettuce, they can use the stove and oven. The user has the pork chop now. They need to cook it. The stove is there, but it's empty. Maybe they need to put the pork chop on the stove and cook it. Then use the oven for baking? Or maybe the oven is for something else.

Wait, the user has the pork chop and lettuce. The recipe might require both. So maybe they need to cook the pork chop and use the lettuce as a side. The stove is conventional, so maybe they can cook the pork chop on the stove. Then, maybe the oven is for roasting or something else. But the user hasn't used the oven yet.

So the next step would be to use the stove. They have the pork chop, so they can put it on the stove. The command would be "put pork chop on stove" or "cook pork chop on stove". But the game might expect a specific command. Alternatively, maybe they need to use the oven. But the oven is closed. So they might need to open the oven first.

Wait, the user has the pork chop and the lettuce. The cookbook is closed. Maybe they need to open the cookbook to find the recipe. But earlier, they tried to open it and it wasn't possible. Maybe the correct action is to take the cookbook first. Let me check the previous steps.

In the first step, the user tried to open the cookbook, but it wasn't possible. Then they took the pork chop. Now, maybe they need to open the cookbook again. But why was it not possible before? Maybe they need to take the cookbook first. So the next action should be to take the cookbook from the counter. Then, maybe open it. But the user hasn't taken the cookbook yet.

Wait, the user is in the kitchen, and the cookbook is on the counter. So the correct action would be to take the cookbook first. Then, maybe open it. But the user tried to open it and it wasn't possible. So maybe the cookbook is closed, and they need to open it. But the game might require them to take it first. So the next action should be to take the cookbook from the counter. Then, open it. But the user hasn't done that yet.

Alternatively, maybe the recipe is in the cookbook, so once they have the ingredients, they can use the stove and oven. But without the recipe, they might not know how to proceed. So the user needs to open the cookbook to get the recipe. But the initial attempt to open it failed. Maybe the correct action is to take the cookbook first. Let me check the environment again.

In the kitchen, the user sees a counter with a cookbook. So the first step is to take the cookbook. Then, maybe open it. But the user tried to open it and it wasn't possible. So maybe the correct action is to take the cookbook, then open it. But the user hasn't taken it yet. So the next action should be to take the cookbook from the counter. Then, open it. But the user is at step 1/3, and the score increased by one. So the next action is to take the cookbook. But the user hasn't done that yet.

Wait, the user's last action was taking the pork chop. Now, the next step is to take the cookbook. So the correct action is to take the cookbook from the counter. Then, open it. But the user might not have done that yet. So the next action is to take the cookbook. Then, open it. But the user is at step 1/3, so maybe the next action is to open the cookbook again. But the previous attempt failed. Maybe the correct action is to take the cookbook first. So the answer should be to take the cookbook from the counter.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal in this text-based game. The goal is to follow the recipe from the cookbook to make a dish. So far, they've taken the pork chop from the fridge and the cookbook from the counter. The next logical step would be to check the cookbook for the recipe. But wait, the user tried to open the cookbook earlier, and it wasn't possible. Maybe they need to look through it instead.

Wait, the user just took the cookbook, so now they need to open it. But the previous attempt to open it failed. Hmm, maybe the cookbook is closed, so they need to open it first. But the user already took it from the counter. So the next action should be to open the cookbook. But the system message said "It isn't something you can open." Maybe the cookbook is closed, so they need to open it. But the user is in the kitchen, so maybe they can open it now. Alternatively, maybe they need to find the recipe steps. Let me think: the user has the pork chop and the cookbook. The next step is to read the recipe. So maybe the user needs to open the cookbook to find the instructions. But the previous attempt to open it didn't work. Maybe the correct action is to open the cookbook again, but the system might have a different command. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to look at the cookbook's pages. But the game might require a specific command. Since the user has the cookbook, the next step is to open it. So the correct action is "open cookbook".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal using the items in the kitchen. They've already taken the pork chop from the fridge and the cookbook from the counter. The problem is that the cookbook isn't opening. So, the next step would be to figure out how to use the cookbook.

Since the cookbook is closed, maybe they need to open it. But the user tried "open cookbook" again and it didn't work. Maybe the cookbook is in a different location or needs a different action. Wait, the user is in the kitchen, and the cookbook is on the counter. They took it, so maybe they need to look inside the cookbook for a recipe. But the game might require them to read the cookbook first, which might involve a specific command.

Alternatively, maybe the cookbook is a book that needs to be opened, but the game doesn't allow that action. So perhaps the next step is to check the contents of the cookbook. But the user can't open it, so maybe they need to use the cookbook to find a recipe. Wait, the original goal was to cook a meal, so maybe the recipe is in the cookbook. Since the user can't open it, maybe they need to use the cookbook in another way. Or maybe they need to look for a recipe in the kitchen. But the items available are pork chop, lettuce, knife, stove, oven, etc. Maybe the user needs to use the cookbook to find a recipe that uses the pork chop and lettuce. But since the cookbook isn't opening, perhaps the next step is to try to read it, even though it's closed. Or maybe the user needs to use the knife to cut the pork chop or lettuce. But the user hasn't done that yet. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the stove to cook the pork chop. But the stove is empty. So, maybe the next step is to use the knife on the pork chop to prepare it. But the user hasn't done that yet. Wait, the user has the pork chop and the cookbook. The goal is to make a meal, so the next step would be to use the cookbook to find a recipe, but since it's closed, maybe the user needs to open it. But the game says it's not something you can open. So perhaps the user needs to look at the cookbook in another way. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the cookbook to find a recipe, even if it's closed. But the game might require the user to open it first. Since the user can't open it, maybe they need to try a different action. Wait, maybe the user needs to check the cookbook's contents without opening it. But the game might not allow that. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the cookbook to find a recipe, and the game expects the user to use the 'read' command. But the user can't open it. So maybe the next step is to try to read the cookbook, even though it's closed. But the game might not allow that. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the cookbook to find a recipe, and the game expects the user to use the 'use' command. But the user hasn't tried that yet. So, the next action would be to try to use the cookbook. But the game might not allow that. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to look for a recipe in the kitchen, but the only items are the pork chop, lettuce, knife, stove, oven, and cookbook. So, maybe the user needs to use the knife to cut the pork chop and lettuce, then cook them on the stove. But the user hasn't done that yet. So, the next step would be to use the knife on the pork chop. But the user hasn't done that. So, the next action is to use the knife on the pork chop. But the user hasn't done that yet. So, the answer is to use the knife on the pork chop.

Or perhaps "use knife on pork chop" is the right command, but the system said it's not recognized. Maybe the game expects "cut" as the verb. Let me think. The user has the knife and the pork chop.

Okay, the user is trying to cook a meal in this text-based game. Let me recap the current situation. They've taken the pork chop from the fridge and the cookbook from the counter. They tried to open the cookbook but couldn't, then used the knife on the pork chop, which wasn't a valid command. Now they tried "cut pork chop" and were told to specify how to cut it: slice, dice, or chop.

So the next step is to choose one of those three actions. The user needs to pick a valid cutting method. Since the goal is to cook a meal, maybe chopping the pork chop would be a logical first step. But the game requires a specific command. Let me check the previous interactions. The user had a pork chop, a knife, and a cookbook. They need to follow the recipe from the cookbook. But the cookbook isn't open yet. Wait, maybe the recipe is in the cookbook, so they need to open it first. But earlier attempts to open it failed. Maybe the cookbook is closed, so they need to open it before proceeding.

But the user just tried "cut pork chop" and was told to specify the method. So perhaps the correct action is to choose one of the three cutting methods. The user might need to cut the pork chop first before proceeding to cook it. Let me think: the recipe might require chopping the pork, so "chop pork chop" could be the next step. But the game says to specify slice, dice, or chop. So the correct command would be "chop pork chop". But the user previously tried "cut pork chop" and was told to specify. So the correct action is to use one of the three options. Let me check the possible commands again. The user needs to use the knife to cut the pork chop. So the valid commands are "slice pork chop", "dice pork chop", or "chop pork chop". The user might need to choose one of these. Since the user is trying to follow the recipe, maybe "chop" is the right choice here. So the next action should be "chop pork chop".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal in this text adventure. They've already taken the pork chop from the fridge and the cookbook from the counter. They tried to open the cookbook but couldn't. Then they tried to use the knife on the pork chop, but that wasn't a valid command. Next, they tried to cut the pork chop, but the game asked them to specify the method: slice, dice, or chop. They chose "chop," and now the game is asking what they want to chop the pork chop with.

So, the next step is to use the knife. Since the knife is on the table, they need to specify using the knife to chop the pork chop. The correct command would be to use the knife on the pork chop. The user has the knife available, so the action should be "use knife on pork chop." But wait, earlier when they tried "use knife on pork chop," the game said that's not a recognized verb. Hmm, maybe the correct syntax is different. Let me check the previous interactions.

Earlier, when they tried "use knife on pork chop," the response was "That's not a verb I recognise." Then they tried "cut pork chop," which was valid, but then the game asked for the method. After choosing "chop," the game asked for the tool. So the correct action here is to specify the tool, which is the knife. So the next command should be "use knife on pork chop" again, but maybe the game expects a different phrasing. Alternatively, maybe it's "chop pork chop with knife." But the game might require the exact command. Since the user has already taken the knife (assuming it's on the table and they can take it), the correct action is to use the knife to chop the pork chop. The previous attempt was "use knife on pork chop," which was rejected. Maybe the correct command is "chop pork chop with knife." But the game might accept "use knife on pork chop" if the user has the knife. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to first take the knife. Wait, the knife is on the table, so the user needs to take it first. But in the previous steps, the user hasn't taken the knife yet. So the correct sequence would be: take knife from table, then use it to chop the pork chop. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next step is to take the knife first. Wait, but the user is currently in the kitchen, and the knife is on the table. So the user needs to take the knife, then use it to chop the pork chop. But in the previous steps, the user hasn't taken the knife. So the next action should be to take the knife from the table. Then, after taking the knife, they can use it to chop the pork chop. But the current prompt is asking what they want to chop the pork chop with. So the user needs to specify the tool, which is the knife. Therefore, the correct command is "use knife on pork chop." But the game said that's not a recognized verb. Maybe the correct command is "chop pork chop with knife." Alternatively, the game might expect "use knife to chop pork chop." But the user has to follow the exact command structure. Since the user is at the step where they need to specify the tool, the correct action is to use the knife. So the next command should be "use knife on pork chop." But the game rejected it. Maybe the correct command is "chop pork chop with knife." Let me check the previous interactions again. The user tried "chop pork chop" and the game asked for the method. Then they chose "chop," and the game asked for the tool. So the next step is to specify the tool. The available tool is the knife. So the correct command is "use knife on pork chop." But the game said that's not a recognized verb. Maybe the correct command is "chop pork chop with knife." Alternatively, the game might expect "use knife to chop pork chop." But the user has to follow the exact command. Since the user has the knife on the table, they need to take it first.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal in this text-based game. The goal is to follow the recipe from the cookbook. So far, they've taken the pork chop from the fridge, the cookbook from the counter, and the knife from the table. They tried to chop the pork chop but got prompted to specify the tool.

Wait, the user just took the knife, so now they should be able to use it to chop the pork chop. The previous step was taking the knife, so the next logical action is to chop the pork chop with the knife. But the game might require a specific command format. Let me check the history.

The user tried "chop pork chop" and was asked to specify the tool. Then they took the knife. Now, the correct command would be to use the knife on the pork chop. So the next action should be "chop pork chop with knife" or similar. But the game might accept "chop pork chop" again, but since they already have the knife, maybe the system expects the tool to be specified. However, the user's last action was taking the knife, so the next step is to chop the pork chop with the knife. The correct command here is probably "chop pork chop with knife". But the game might have a specific syntax. Alternatively, maybe "use knife on pork chop" is the correct command. Let me check the previous interactions.

Earlier, when the user tried "use knife on pork chop", the system said "That's not a verb I recognise." So maybe the correct verb is "chop" and the tool is specified. So the correct command would be "chop pork chop with knife". But the user might need to use the correct syntax. Alternatively, maybe "chop pork chop" is sufficient once the knife is in hand. But the system previously asked to specify the tool. So the user needs to specify the tool. Therefore, the next action should be "chop pork chop with knife".
