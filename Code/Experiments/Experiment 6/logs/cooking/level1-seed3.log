You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You've entered a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

You see a fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop and a lettuce! You can make out a closed conventional looking oven close by. You can see a table. You see a knife on the table. You can see a counter. On the counter you can see a cookbook. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal in this text adventure. They started by looking at the kitchen and found a fridge with a raw pork chop and lettuce. There's a cookbook on the counter, but when they tried to open it, it wasn't possible. Then they looked around again and tried looking at the cookbook, which had a recipe for a meal using a pork chop. The recipe says to dice and roast the pork chop.

But the user is hesitant because the pork chop is raw. The recipe's directions are pretty vague—just dice and roast. The user might need to find a way to cook the pork chop. The stove is there, but it's empty. Maybe they need to use the stove to roast the pork chop after dicing it. They have a knife on the table, so maybe they can dice the pork chop with that. The oven is closed, but maybe they can use it instead of the stove. Wait, the recipe says "roast," which usually requires an oven. But the stove is conventional, maybe a stovetop oven? Or maybe the user needs to use the stove's heating element to roast it. 

The user has already looked at the cookbook and the pork chop. The next step would be to dice the pork chop with the knife. Then, maybe put it in the oven or on the stove to roast. But the oven is closed, so they need to open it first. Alternatively, use the stove. But the recipe says "roast," so maybe the oven is the right place. So the next action should be to open the oven, then put the diced pork chop inside, and then roast it. But the user hasn't opened the oven yet. So the next step would be to open the oven. Wait, but the user is at the kitchen, and the oven is closed. So the user needs to open it. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action would be to open the oven. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to first dice the pork chop. The user has the knife, so they can dice it. Let me check the previous steps again.

The user tried to open the cookbook but couldn't. Then looked around, then looked at the cookbook, which had the recipe. Then looked at the pork chop, which was raw. The user is now considering whether they're on the right track. The recipe says to dice and roast the pork chop. So the next logical step is to dice the pork chop with the knife. So the action would be "dice pork chop" or "use knife on pork chop". But the game's commands might require specific syntax. The user has the knife on the table, so they can take the knife first, then dice the pork chop. But the user hasn't taken the knife yet. So maybe the next step is to take the knife, then dice the pork chop. But the user's last action was looking at the pork chop, and the response was that they couldn't eat the raw pork chop. So the user needs to process it according to the recipe. The recipe says to dice it, so the next action should be to dice the pork chop. But how? The user has the knife, so they can use it to dice. So the next command would be "dice pork chop with knife" or something similar. But the game might require specific commands. Alternatively, the user can just "dice pork chop". The user's previous action was looking at the pork chop, so the next step is to perform the action described in the recipe. The recipe says "dice the pork chop", so the user should do that. So the next action is "dice pork chop".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal in the kitchen. They have a raw pork chop and a knife. The recipe says to dice the pork chop. But every time they try to dice it, the game says "Cutting something requires a knife." Wait, they already took the knife from the table. Maybe the issue is that they need to use the knife on the pork chop instead of just dicing it. The previous attempt to use the knife on the pork chop resulted in an error. Maybe the correct command is to slice or chop the pork chop with the knife. Alternatively, maybe they need to put the pork chop on the stove or oven first. But the recipe says to roast it after dicing. The oven is closed, so they need to open it. But the user hasn't done that yet. Alternatively, maybe the stove is the right place to roast it. But the stove is empty. So the steps are: dice the pork chop with the knife, then roast it in the oven or on the stove. Since the recipe says "roast," the oven is probably needed. So next steps: open the oven, put the diced pork chop inside, then roast it. But the user is stuck on dicing. The error message says "Cutting something requires a knife," but they have the knife. Maybe the correct command is "slice pork chop with knife" or "chop pork chop with knife." The previous attempt to "use knife on pork chop" didn't work. Maybe "cut pork chop with knife" is the right command. Let's try that.
