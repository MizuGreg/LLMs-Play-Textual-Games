You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Pantry =-
You're now in a pantry.

You can see a shelf. But the thing is empty.

There is an open plain door leading north.

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

You see an opened fridge. What a letdown! The fridge is empty! You make out a closed oven right there by you. Look over there! a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Look over there! a counter. You see a raw yellow potato, a yellow onion, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty. You move on, clearly depressed by your TextWorld experience.

There is an open plain door leading south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

You see an opened fridge. What a letdown! The fridge is empty! You make out a closed oven right there by you. Look over there! a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Look over there! a counter. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty. You move on, clearly depressed by your TextWorld experience.

There is an open plain door leading south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.

You find yourself in a livingroom. An ordinary kind of place. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."

Oh, great. Here's a sofa. The sofa is comfy. However, the sofa, like an empty sofa, has nothing on it.

There is an exit to the east. There is an exit to the west.

You are in a kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

You see an opened fridge. What a letdown! The fridge is empty! You make out a closed oven right there by you. Look over there! a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Look over there! a counter. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty. You move on, clearly depressed by your TextWorld experience.

There is an open plain door leading south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.

You are in a kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

You see an opened fridge. What a letdown! The fridge is empty! You make out a closed oven right there by you. Look over there! a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Look over there! a counter. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty. You move on, clearly depressed by your TextWorld experience.

There is an open plain door leading south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.
