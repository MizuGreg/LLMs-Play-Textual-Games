You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Pantry =-
You arrive in a pantry. An usual one.

You see a shelf. But there isn't a thing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is an open plain door leading west.

go west
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You can make out a fridge! The fridge contains a raw pork chop, a red onion, a red bell pepper, a red apple, a yellow onion, a white onion, an orange bell pepper and a raw white tuna. You shudder, but continue examining the room. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see an oven. You can make out a table. The table appears to be empty. You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a red hot pepper, a green apple, a banana, a raw red tuna, a yellow bell pepper, a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a stove. But the thing is empty.

There is an open plain door leading east. You need an exit without a door? You should try going north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door.
