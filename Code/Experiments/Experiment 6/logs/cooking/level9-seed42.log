You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Bathroom =-
You make a grand eccentric entrance into a bathroom. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

What's that over there? It looks like it's a toilet. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You swear loudly.

There is an exit to the north.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

-= Kitchen =-
You've entered a kitchen.

You can see a closed fridge. You see an oven. Is this what you came to TextWorld for? This... oven? You can see a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. You smell a wretched smell, and follow it to a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. Hmmm... what else, what else? You scan the room, seeing a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

There is a closed screen door leading north. There is a closed frosted-glass door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.
