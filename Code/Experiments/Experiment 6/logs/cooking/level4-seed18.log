There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one. There is an exit to the west.

You've entered a bathroom.

You need an exit without a door? You should try going north.

You need an exit without a door? You should try going north.
