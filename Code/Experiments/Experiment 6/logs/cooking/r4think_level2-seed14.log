You are in a kitchen. An usual one.

Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a fridge. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The fridge contains a green bell pepper, a block of cheese, a green hot pepper, an orange bell pepper, a raw red tuna and a carrot. Hey, want to see an oven? Look over there, an oven. You can make out a table. The table is massive. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a cookbook and a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is in a text-based game where they need to cook a meal using the ingredients from the kitchen. The recipe requires chopping the block of cheese and roasting it, along with dicing the green bell pepper and frying it. So far, the user tried to chop the cheese but was told that cutting requires a knife. They then tried using the knife on the cheese, but the system said that's not a recognized verb.

Wait, maybe the issue is with the phrasing. The game might expect specific verbs. The user tried "chop" and "use the knife on," but the system didn't accept "use the knife on." Maybe the correct command is just "use the knife" or "cut the cheese with the knife." Alternatively, perhaps the game expects the user to first pick up the knife, then use it on the cheese.

Looking back at the previous steps: The user was in the kitchen, saw the knife on the counter, and tried to use it. The error message says "That's not a verb I recognise," which suggests that "use the knife on the block of cheese" isn't the right syntax. Maybe the correct command is "cut the block of cheese with the knife" or "use the knife to chop the block of cheese." But the game might have specific commands. Since the user tried "chop" and "use the knife on," but got errors, maybe the correct action is to first pick up the knife, then use it. However, in the initial state, the user hasn't picked up the knife yet. So perhaps the correct sequence is to take the knife first, then use it on the cheese. But the user hasn't done that yet. Alternatively, maybe the game allows "cut the block of cheese" if the knife is available. But the system said cutting requires a knife, so the user needs to use the knife. Maybe the correct command is "cut the block of cheese with the knife," but the system might not recognize that. Alternatively, the game might expect "use the knife on the block of cheese" but the system is strict with syntax. Since the user tried that and got an error, maybe the correct action is to "use the knife" on the cheese. But the system says that's not a verb. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "chop the block of cheese" again, but the system says that requires a knife. So perhaps the user needs to first take the knife, then use it. But in the current state, the user is at the counter where the knife is. So the next step should be to take the knife, then use it on the cheese. However, the user hasn't taken the knife yet. So the correct action would be "take the knife," then "use the knife on the block of cheese." But the user hasn't done that yet. The previous attempt was "use the knife on the block of cheese," which was rejected. So maybe the correct command is "take the knife," then "chop the block of cheese." But the user is confused. Alternatively, maybe the game expects "cut the block of cheese" if the knife is available. But the system says cutting requires a knife, so the user must use the knife. Therefore, the next step is to take the knife first. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the correct action is "take the knife," then proceed to cut the cheese. However, the user's last action was "use the knife on the block of cheese," which was rejected. Therefore, the next step should be to take the knife first. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the correct command is "take the knife."

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to chop the block of cheese using the knife. They took the cheese from the fridge and the knife from the counter. The previous attempt was "use the knife on the block of cheese," which the system rejected because "That's not a verb I recognise." The user then tried "chop the block of cheese with the knife," which also didn't work. The system says that "use the knife on the block of cheese" is not a recognized verb. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the correct command is just "chop the block of cheese" since the knife is already in hand. But earlier, the system said cutting requires a knife, so maybe the user needs to use the knife. Alternatively, maybe the game expects the verb "cut" instead of "chop." Let me check the recipe again. The recipe says "chop the block of cheese" and "roast the block of cheese." So the correct action is to chop it. But the system says that chopping requires a knife, so the user has to use the knife. But the user already took the knife. So maybe the correct command is "cut the block of cheese" instead of "chop." Or perhaps "use the knife to chop the block of cheese." But the system didn't accept "use the knife on." Maybe the correct verb is "cut" instead of "chop." Let me try that. The user has the knife and the cheese. So the next action should be "cut the block of cheese." Let's try that.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based cooking game. Their goal is to follow the recipe from the cookbook to prepare a meal. So far, they've managed to chop the block of cheese, which was the first step in the recipe. The next steps are to roast the block of cheese, dice the green bell pepper, fry the green bell pepper, and then prepare the meal.

Looking at the current state, the user has the block of cheese chopped. Now, the next step according to the recipe is to "roast the block of cheese." But the user needs to figure out how to roast it. In the kitchen, there's an oven mentioned. So maybe the next action is to put the chopped cheese into the oven. However, the user hasn't interacted with the oven yet. They might need to go to the oven first or find a way to roast the cheese there.

Alternatively, maybe the game expects the user to use the stove since there's a stove in the kitchen. But the recipe says "roast," which typically uses an oven. The user has the cheese, so they need to place it in the oven. But the game might require specific commands like "put the chopped block of cheese in the oven" or "roast the block of cheese in the oven." Since the user has the cheese, the next step is to roast it. The correct command would be "roast the block of cheese" or "put the block of cheese in the oven." Given that the oven is mentioned in the kitchen, the user should probably go to the oven first. But the current location is the kitchen, so maybe they can directly roast it. However, the game might require the user to specify the oven. Let me check the previous steps. The user was in the kitchen, saw the oven, table, counter, and fridge. The oven is in the same room. So the next action should be to roast the cheese in the oven. The correct command would be "roast the block of cheese in the oven." But the game might not recognize "in the oven" as part of the command. Alternatively, the user might need to "put the block of cheese in the oven" or "place the block of cheese in the oven." Since the user has the cheese, the next step is to roast it. The correct command is likely "roast the block of cheese." Let's try that.

Okay, let's see. The user has successfully put the block of cheese in the oven. The next step according to the recipe is to "roast the block of cheese." But since they already put it in the oven, maybe the next action is to close the oven again. Wait, but the recipe says "roast," which might require turning on the oven or setting the temperature. However, in the game, the user might just need to close the oven after putting the cheese in. Alternatively, maybe the game expects the user to "roast" the cheese directly. But the user already put it in the oven, so maybe the next step is to close the oven. Let me check the previous steps. The user opened the oven, put the cheese in, and now the oven is open. The next logical step is to close it to start roasting. So the command would be "close the oven." That makes sense. Let me confirm: the user has the cheese in the oven, so closing it would initiate the roasting process. The recipe says "roast the block of cheese," so closing the oven would be the next action. Therefore, the correct command is "close the oven."

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to dice the green bell pepper. They have the knife and the green bell pepper. The previous attempt was "use the knife on the green bell pepper," which the system rejected. The error message says "That's not a verb I recognise." So maybe the correct command is different. The recipe says "dice the green bell pepper," but the system might require using the knife. Since the user already has the knife, maybe they need to use it to dice the pepper. But the system didn't accept "use the knife on" before. Maybe the correct verb is "dice" instead of "use the knife on." Wait, the user tried "dice the green bell pepper" earlier, but the system said "Cutting something requires a knife." So they need to use the knife. Perhaps the correct command is "cut the green bell pepper with the knife," but the system might not recognize that. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to first take the green bell pepper. Wait, in the initial setup, the green bell pepper is in the fridge. The user hasn't taken it yet. So maybe they need to take the green bell pepper first. Let me check the previous steps. The user took the block of cheese from the fridge, but the green bell pepper is still in the fridge. So the next step should be to take the green bell pepper. Then, use the knife to dice it. But the user hasn't taken the pepper yet. So the correct action is "take the green bell pepper." Then, use the knife to dice it. But the user's last action was "use the knife on the green bell pepper," which failed. So maybe the correct sequence is first take the pepper, then dice it. But the user is at the kitchen counter where the knife is. Wait, the green bell pepper is in the fridge. So the user needs to go to the fridge, take the green bell pepper, then come back to the counter to dice it. But the current location is the kitchen. The fridge is in the kitchen. So the user should go to the fridge, take the green bell pepper, then return to the counter to dice it. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next step is to "go to the fridge," then "take the green bell pepper." But the user is in the kitchen. So the correct command is "go to the fridge," then "take the green bell pepper." However, the user might not have the ability to go to the fridge directly. Alternatively, maybe the user can take the green bell pepper from the fridge. But the system might require the user to be at the fridge. So the next action should be "go to the fridge," then "take the green bell pepper." But the user hasn't done that yet.

Okay, the user has taken the green bell pepper from the fridge. Now they need to dice it. They have the knife from the counter. The previous attempt was "use the knife on the green bell pepper," which didn't work. The system said "That's not a verb I recognise." So maybe the correct command is "dice the green bell pepper" but with the knife. Since the user has the knife, maybe they need to use it to dice the pepper. The recipe says "dice the green bell pepper," so the correct action is to dice it. But the system might require using the knife. So the command should be "use the knife to dice the green bell pepper" or "dice the green bell pepper with the knife." However, the system might not accept "use the knife to." Alternatively, the user might just need to "dice the green bell pepper" since they have the knife. Let me check the previous steps. The user has the knife and the green bell pepper. The correct command is likely "dice the green bell pepper." Let's try that.

You need to specify how you want to fry the green bell pepper. Either sauté, pan-fry, or deep-fry it.

Okay, the user is trying to fry the green bell pepper. They've already diced it, so now they need to cook it. The previous attempts to use "fry" didn't work, and the system suggested "saute, pan-fry, or deep-fry." The user tried "pan-fry" but got a confused response. Maybe the correct command is "fry the green bell pepper" but with the correct tool, like a pan. Since the kitchen has a stove, maybe they need to use the pan. But the user hasn't taken the pan yet. Wait, in the initial description, the kitchen has a stove but nothing on it. So the user needs to find a pan. But the user is at the counter where the knife and cookbook are. Maybe the pan is on the stove. So the next step is to "go to the stove," then "take the pan," then "fry the green bell pepper." But the user hasn't done that yet. Alternatively, maybe the game expects the user to use the stove directly. Since the user is in the kitchen, maybe they can just "fry the green bell pepper" without specifying the tool. But the system said "That's not a verb I recognise." So perhaps the correct command is "pan-fry the green bell pepper" but the system doesn't recognize it. Alternatively, the user needs to use the stove. So the next action is to "use the stove to fry the green bell pepper." But the system might not accept that. Alternatively, the user needs to "put the green bell pepper in the pan" and then "fry it." But the pan isn't mentioned yet. The user might need to take the pan from the stove. So the correct sequence is "go to the stove," "take the pan," then "fry the green bell pepper." But the user is currently at the counter. So the next step is to "go to the stove."

Okay, the user is trying to fry the green bell pepper but keeps getting errors. They tried "fry the green bell pepper" and "pan-fry," but the system doesn't recognize those. The previous steps show they have the diced pepper and the knife. The kitchen has a stove, but the pan isn't mentioned. Maybe the correct action is to "put the green bell pepper in the pan" and then "fry it." But the user hasn't taken the pan yet. The system might require the user to first take the pan from the stove. However, the user tried "take the pan from the stove" and got an error. Maybe the correct command is "take the pan" without specifying the stove. Alternatively, the user needs to "use the stove" to fry the pepper. Since the system is strict with verbs, maybe the correct command is "fry the green bell pepper" again, even though it didn't work before. But the user is confused. The next step should be to try "fry the green bell pepper" once more, even though it's been tried before. Alternatively, the user might need to "heat the pan" first. But the system might not recognize that. The correct answer is likely "fry the green bell pepper," so I'll try that again.

Okay, the user is stuck on the frying step. They tried "fry the green bell pepper" but it didn't work. Looking at the available commands, maybe they need to use "put" instead. The recipe says to "fry the green bell pepper," but in the game, the correct command might be "put the green bell pepper in the pan" or "fry the green bell pepper with the pan." Since the user has the green bell pepper and the knife, perhaps they need to use the stove or pan. The available commands include "put ... on ..." or "put ... in ...". The user might need to put the pepper in the pan first. But the pan isn't mentioned yet. Wait, the kitchen has a stove, so maybe the user needs to "put the green bell pepper in the pan on the stove." But the system might require specific commands. The correct action is likely "put the green bell pepper in the pan" or "fry the green bell pepper in the pan." Since the user can't use "fry" directly, maybe "put the green bell pepper in the pan" is the way to go. Let me check the available commands again. The user can "put ... on ..." or "put ... in ...". So the next step is to put the pepper in the pan. But the user hasn't taken the pan yet. So first, they need to take the pan from the stove. But the user tried that and got an error. Maybe the correct command is "take the pan from the stove." But the system says that's not a verb. Alternatively, the user can "use the stove" to fry the pepper. But the available commands don't have "use" for that. The correct command is probably "put the green bell pepper in the pan" after taking the pan. Since the user is stuck, the next action should be to "put the green bell pepper in the pan" once the pan is taken. But the user needs to take the pan first. So the correct sequence is "take the pan from the stove" followed by "put the green bell pepper in the pan." But the user tried "take the pan from the stove" and got an error. Maybe the correct command is "take the pan" without specifying the stove. Let me try that.

<think>
Okay, the user is really stuck here. They've tried multiple times to put the green bell pepper in the pan on the stove, but the system keeps saying "You can't see any such thing." Maybe the pan isn't in the kitchen. The initial description mentioned a stove but nothing on it. The user might need to find the pan elsewhere. Wait, the user is in the kitchen, and the counter has a knife and cookbook. The fridge has ingredients. Maybe the pan is in the oven? Or perhaps the user needs to take the pan from the stove. But the user tried "take the pan" and got an error. Maybe the correct command is "take the pan from the stove." But the system says that's not a verb. Alternatively, the user needs to "use the stove" to get the pan. But the available commands don't have that. The user is close to completing the recipe, but the final step is unclear. The next action should be to "put the green bell pepper in the pan" again, even though it's been tried. Alternatively, the user might need to "fry the green bell pepper" again. But the system doesn't recognize it. The correct answer is likely "put the green bell pepper in the pan" despite the error.
