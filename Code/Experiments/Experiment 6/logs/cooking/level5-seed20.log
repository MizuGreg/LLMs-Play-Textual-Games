You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. An usual one.

You can make out a fridge! The fridge contains a raw pork chop, a raw white tuna, a white onion and a raw red tuna. You make out a closed oven. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a knife. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a cookbook. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.

There is an open frosted-glass door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east.

You arrive in a bedroom. An usual kind of place.

You can make out a bed. However, the bed, like an empty bed, has nothing on it.

There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.

-= Livingroom =-
You are in a livingroom. A standard one. The room is well lit.

You see a sofa. You can't really describe the sofa besides that it's comfy. But there isn't a thing on it.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one. There is an exit to the west.
