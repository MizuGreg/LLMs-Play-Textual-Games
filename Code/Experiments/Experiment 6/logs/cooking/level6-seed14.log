You've entered a kitchen.

Hey, want to see a fridge? Look over there, a fridge. The fridge contains a green bell pepper, a block of cheese, a yellow onion, a raw white tuna, a green hot pepper, an orange bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a red onion, a raw red tuna, a red bell pepper and a carrot. A closed conventional looking oven is close by. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Look over there! a counter. You shudder, but continue examining the counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. You scan the room, seeing a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is an open frosted-glass door leading south. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door. There is an exit to the west.
