You need an exit without a door? You should try going north.

-= Bathroom =-
This is going to sound unbelievable, but you've just entered a bathroom. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."

What's that over there? It looks like it's a toilet. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

You need an exit without a door? You should try going north.
