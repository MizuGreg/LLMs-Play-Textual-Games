You've just sauntered into a bathroom. You begin looking for stuff.



There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.

You have moved into a corridor. Not the corridor you'd expect. No, this is a corridor.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.

You arrive in a kitchen. An ordinary one.

You can make out a closed fridge. You can see an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. Hm. Oh well You can make out a stove. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a stove, go to TextWorld. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is a closed frosted-glass door leading east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door. There is an exit to the south.
