You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You've entered a kitchen. You start to take note of what's in the room.

Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a fridge. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The fridge contains a raw red tuna, a red onion, a raw white tuna, a block of cheese and a lettuce. You see an oven. You see a table. The table is massive. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Silly table, silly, empty, good for nothing table. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a green apple, a green bell pepper, a red apple, a green hot pepper, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. Were you looking for a stove? Because look over there, it's a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

You've entered a kitchen. You start to take note of what's in the room.

Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a fridge. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The fridge contains a raw red tuna, a red onion, a raw white tuna, a block of cheese and a lettuce. You see an oven. You see a table. The table is massive. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Silly table, silly, empty, good for nothing table. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a green apple, a green bell pepper, a red apple, a green hot pepper, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. Were you looking for a stove? Because look over there, it's a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?
