You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Livingroom =-
I am stoked to announce that you are now in the livingroom.

If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a sofa. You wonder idly who left that here. But the thing is empty. Hopefully, this discovery doesn't ruin your TextWorld experience!

You need an exit without a door? You should try going north.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal by finding a recipe in the kitchen. They started in the living room, then went north to the bedroom, then north again to the corridor, then west to the bathroom, and back east to the corridor again.

The current location is the corridor again, with the same description. The user is asking if they're on the right track and if they're close to the goal. The goal is to find the cookbook in the kitchen to get the recipe.

So far, they've passed through several rooms: living room, bedroom, bathroom, and back to the corridor. The kitchen hasn't been mentioned yet. The initial instruction said to check the cookbook in the kitchen. So the next step would be to find the kitchen. But the current corridor has exits north, south, east (sliding door), and west. The user is in the corridor again, so maybe they need to go east through the sliding patio door to reach the kitchen? Or maybe the kitchen is another direction. But the previous rooms don't mention the kitchen yet. The user might need to explore further. Since the sliding door is closed, maybe they need to open it. But the game's responses so far haven't mentioned any actions needed to open it. Alternatively, maybe the kitchen is accessible through another exit. But the user is in the corridor, and the previous rooms didn't include the kitchen. So the next logical step would be to check the east sliding door, perhaps. But the user is asking if they're close. Since they haven't found the kitchen yet, they might need to proceed east through the sliding door. But the game's previous steps didn't have the user go through that door yet. So the next action should be to go east through the sliding door to reach the kitchen. But the user is in the corridor again, so maybe the correct direction is east. The user's last action was going east from the bathroom back to the corridor. Now, in the corridor, the east exit is the sliding door. So the next step is to go east to reach the kitchen, which is where the cookbook is. Therefore, the next action should be "go east".

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is trying to navigate through a text-based game to find a cookbook in the kitchen. They started in the living room, then moved through several rooms: bedroom, corridor, bathroom, and back to the corridor. The current location is the corridor, where there's a closed sliding patio door leading east.

The user has been trying to go east, but the game keeps prompting them to open the sliding patio door first. They've tried saying "open sliding patio door east" multiple times, but the game isn't recognizing it. Instead, it's just repeating the same message. The user is now asking if they're on the right track and if they're close to the goal.

Hmm, maybe the correct command to open the door is different. The game might expect a simpler command like "open door" or "open east door" instead of specifying "sliding patio door east". Alternatively, maybe the door has a specific name or requires a different action. Since the user has been stuck on this door for several attempts, perhaps they need to try a different approach. Let me check the previous interactions again.

In the corridor description, it says there's a closed sliding patio door leading east. The user tried "go east" but was told to open the door first. Then they tried "open sliding patio door east", which the game didn't recognize. Maybe the correct command is just "open door" or "open east". Alternatively, maybe the door is called something else, like "sliding door" or "patio door".

Since the game's responses are limited, the user might need to use the most straightforward command. The previous attempts to specify the door's type and direction might be causing confusion. The game might just want "open door" or "open east". Let me try that. If the user says "open door", the game might accept it. Alternatively, "open east" could work. But the user has to make sure they're using the correct syntax. Since the game hasn't accepted "open sliding patio door east", maybe it's expecting a simpler command. So the next action should be to try "open door" or "open east".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal by finding a recipe in the kitchen. So far, they've navigated through several rooms: living room, bedroom, corridor, bathroom, back to the corridor, then opened the sliding door to enter the backyard, then went south to the garden. In the garden, they picked up a green apple.

The original goal was to check the cookbook in the kitchen. The user hasn't found the kitchen yet. They're currently in the garden. The next step would be to find the kitchen. But how? The garden's description mentions an exit to the north, which leads back to the previous room, the backyard. But the kitchen hasn't been encountered yet. Maybe the kitchen is through another exit. Wait, in the backyard, there's a closed wooden door leading north. Maybe that's the way to the kitchen? Or perhaps the garden's exit north leads to the kitchen. Alternatively, maybe the kitchen is in the corridor or another room. But the user hasn't explored the backyard's north exit yet. So the next action should be to go north from the garden to the backyard, then check the wooden door. But the user is in the garden, so the next command should be "go north" to return to the backyard. Then, maybe open the wooden door. But the user's last action was picking up the apple, and now they need to proceed towards the kitchen. Since the kitchen is the target, the user needs to find the path back to the kitchen. The garden's north exit is the way back to the backyard, then the wooden door north in the backyard might lead to the kitchen. So the next step is to go north from the garden to the backyard, then open the door. But the user is in the garden, so the immediate next action is "go north".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to open a door in the backyard. The game mentioned a closed wooden door leading north and an open sliding patio door west. The user tried "open wooden door north" and "open door north", but the game didn't recognize it. Now the user is asking which door they mean.

The original goal is to find the cookbook in the kitchen. The user has been moving through rooms, eventually reaching the backyard. The kitchen hasn't been found yet. The wooden door north in the backyard might lead to the kitchen. The sliding door west is already open but leads back to the corridor. Since the user needs to get to the kitchen, they should try opening the wooden door north. The game might expect the command "open wooden door" or "open door north". But the user previously tried "open wooden door north" and it wasn't recognized. Maybe the correct command is just "open door" or "open north door". Alternatively, maybe the door has a specific name. But given the previous interactions, the user should try "open door north" again. However, the game might require a different phrasing. Since the user is confused, the next step is to try opening the wooden door again, perhaps using "open wooden door" without specifying north, but the game might require the direction. Alternatively, maybe the door is called "wooden door" and the direction is implied. But the user needs to follow the game's expected command. Given the previous error, maybe the correct command is "open door" without specifying, but the game might need the direction. Since the user is in the backyard, the north door is the one leading to the kitchen. So the next action is to open the wooden door north.

Okay, the user is trying to open a door in the backyard. The game mentions a closed wooden door leading north and an open sliding patio door west. The user has tried "open wooden door north" and "open door north", but the game isn't recognizing it. The user is confused between the sliding patio door and the wooden door.

The original goal is to find the cookbook in the kitchen. The user needs to get to the kitchen. The wooden door north in the backyard is likely the correct path. The sliding door west is already open but leads back to the corridor. Since the user is in the backyard, the next step is to open the wooden door north. The game might expect the command "open wooden door" or "open door north". But the user has been told to specify the door. Maybe the correct command is "open door north" again. Alternatively, the game might require "open wooden door" without the direction. But the user needs to follow the game's expected syntax. Since the user is stuck, the next action is to try opening the wooden door again, perhaps using "open wooden door" without the direction, but the game might require it. However, the user's previous attempts were incorrect. So, the correct command is likely "open wooden door north" but the game isn't accepting it. Maybe the game expects "open door" without specifying, but the user needs to try that. Alternatively, the user might need to go north first, then open the door. But the user is in the backyard. So, the next action is to try "open door north" again.

Maybe the correct command is just "open door" or "open north door". Since the user is stuck, the next action should be to try "open door" without specifying, but the game might require the direction. Alternatively, the user might need to go north first, then open the door. But the user is in the Backyard. So, the next action is to try "open door north" again.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, the user is stuck in the Backyard trying to open the correct door. The game mentions both a sliding patio door (west) and a wooden door (north). The user has tried "open wooden door north" multiple times, but the game isn't recognizing it. The original goal is to find the cookbook in the kitchen.

The user needs to get to the kitchen. The wooden door north in the Backyard is likely the correct path. The sliding door west is already open but leads back to the corridor. Since the user is in the Backyard, the next step is to open the wooden door north. The game might expect the command "open door" without specifying, but the user has been specifying "wooden door". Maybe the correct command is just "open door" or "open north door". Since the user is stuck, the next action should be to try "open door" without specifying, but the game might require the direction. Alternatively, the user might need to go north first, then open the door. But the user is in the Backyard. So, the next action is to try "open door north" again.
