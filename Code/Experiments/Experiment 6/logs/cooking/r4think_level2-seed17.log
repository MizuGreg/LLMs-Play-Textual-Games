You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. A normal one.

You make out a fridge. The fridge contains a red onion, a raw pork chop, a red bell pepper, a yellow onion, a carrot, a lettuce and an orange bell pepper. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's an oven. You wonder idly who left that here. You scan the room, seeing a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to a stove. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal in the kitchen. They found the cookbook, but it wasn't openable. Then they looked around but couldn't find anything. Now they're asking if they're on the right track and what the next move should be.

First, the initial goal was to check the cookbook for a recipe. The user tried to open it but couldn't. Maybe the cookbook is in a different state, like needing to be picked up or interacted with differently. Since the cookbook is on the table, perhaps they need to take it first. But the user already tried looking around and didn't see anything else. Wait, the user mentioned the cookbook is on the table, so maybe they need to take it to use it. But the problem was that the cookbook wasn't openable. Maybe the correct action is to take the cookbook first, then try to open it again. Alternatively, maybe there's another item they need to use to open it. But the user hasn't interacted with the cookbook yet. The next logical step would be to take the cookbook from the table. Let me check the previous actions. The user tried to open the cookbook but it wasn't possible. So maybe the correct action is to take the cookbook first. The user's last action was looking around, which didn't find anything. So the next step should be to take the cookbook. Then, once taken, maybe open it. But the user is asking if they're close to the goal. Since they haven't used the cookbook yet, perhaps they need to take it. So the next action should be to take the cookbook.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal in the kitchen. They found the cookbook on the table, took it, but couldn't open it. The goal is to check the cookbook for a recipe. Since the cookbook isn't openable, maybe they need to find a way to open it. Perhaps there's a different action they can take with the cookbook. Alternatively, maybe they need to use another item first. Wait, they have a knife on the table. Maybe the knife is needed to open the cookbook. Or maybe the cookbook is a book that needs to be read instead of opened. But the game's previous actions didn't allow reading. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to look for a different object. But the user is stuck on the cookbook. The next step could be to use the knife on the cookbook, but that's just a guess. Alternatively, maybe the cookbook is already in their inventory and they need to interact with it differently. Since the game says "It isn't something you can open," maybe the correct action is to read it, but the game doesn't have a 'read' command. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to look at the cookbook again. But the user already looked around. Hmm. The next possible action might be to use the knife on the cookbook, but that's speculative. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check the fridge again for ingredients. Wait, the original goal was to check the cookbook for the recipe. If the cookbook can't be opened, maybe there's another way to get the recipe. But the user is supposed to check the cookbook. Maybe the correct action is to look at the cookbook again, but the game says they can't see anything. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the knife to cut something, but that's not related. Wait, the user has a knife. Maybe they need to use the knife to prepare an ingredient. But the goal is to find the recipe. So perhaps the next step is to use the knife on the cookbook, but that's not clear. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to look for another object. But the user is stuck. The next action should be to use the knife on the cookbook, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check the fridge again. But the original plan was to check the cookbook. Since the cookbook isn't openable, maybe the game expects a different action. Maybe the user needs to look at the cookbook again. But the game says they can't see anything. Hmm. Maybe the correct action is to use the knife on the cookbook. Let's try that.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe from the cookbook. The current step is after chopping the pork chop, but they need to follow the directions properly.

The recipe says: chop the pork chop, fry the pork chop, dice the red onion, fry the red onion, then prepare the meal. The user has the pork chop and a knife. They tried to chop it, but the game says cutting requires a knife. Wait, they already have the knife, right? The knife is on the table, and they took the cookbook. So maybe they need to use the knife on the pork chop to chop it. But the previous action was "chop pork chop", which the game responded with "Cutting something requires a knife." So maybe the correct command is to use the knife on the pork chop. Let me check the previous steps. The user has the knife, so the next action should be to use the knife on the pork chop to chop it. Then proceed with frying. So the next command should be "use knife on pork chop" or "chop pork chop with knife". But the game might expect the exact command. Since the user tried "chop pork chop" and it failed, maybe the correct action is to use the knife on the pork chop. So the next action is "use knife on pork chop".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to chop the pork chop, but the game keeps saying that cutting requires a knife. They've tried "chop pork chop" and "use knife on pork chop", but the latter isn't recognized. The previous error was "That's not a verb I recognise." So maybe the correct command is to use the knife on the pork chop. But the user tried that and got an error. Wait, maybe the command should be "cut pork chop with knife"? But the game might not accept that. Alternatively, maybe the correct action is to "chop the pork chop" using the knife. But the game says "Cutting something requires a knife." So perhaps the user needs to use the knife first. Wait, the user already has the knife. Maybe the correct command is "use knife on pork chop" but the game doesn't recognize it. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "slice" the pork chop. But the recipe says "chop". Hmm. The user is stuck here. The next step should be to use the knife on the pork chop, even though the game says it's not a verb. Maybe the game expects "chop" with the knife. So the next action is "chop pork chop" again, but the game says it needs a knife. Wait, the user already has the knife. Maybe the correct command is "cut pork chop" but the game says it's not recognized. I'm confused. The user needs to follow the recipe's directions. The recipe says "chop the pork chop". So the correct action is to chop it, but the game requires using the knife. So the next action should be "use knife on pork chop" even though the game says it's not a verb. Maybe the game has a different command structure. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "slice" the pork chop. But the recipe says "chop". I think the correct answer is to use the knife on the pork chop, even if the game says it's not a verb. So the next action is "use knife on pork chop".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe. They took the pork chop from the fridge. The next step is to chop it. But earlier attempts to chop failed because the game said cutting requires a knife. The user has the knife on the table. So the correct action would be to use the knife on the pork chop. But the game might require the exact command. The previous error was "That's not a verb I recognise." So maybe the correct command is "chop pork chop" but with the knife. Alternatively, "cut pork chop with knife". But the game says "You need to take the pork chop first." So the user took it, now they need to chop it.

Okay, the user is trying to fry the pork chop. The game says "That's not a verb I recognise." So maybe the correct command is to use the stove or pan. The user has a knife and pork chop. The previous steps involved chopping the pork chop. Now, they need to fry it. The correct action would be to use the stove. So the next command is "use stove on pork chop" or "fry pork chop on stove". But the game might expect "fry pork chop" with the stove. Let's try "fry pork chop".

Okay, the user is trying to fry the pork chop but the game isn't recognizing the command. Let me think. The previous steps involved chopping the pork chop with the knife. Now, they need to fry it. The game might require using the stove. The correct action would be to use the stove to fry the pork chop. But the user hasn't interacted with the stove yet. So the next step is to use the stove. The command should be "use stove on pork chop" or "fry pork chop with stove". But the game says "That's not a verb I recognise." Maybe the correct command is "fry pork chop" without specifying the stove. Alternatively, the user needs to put the pork chop on the stove. Let me check the previous actions. The user has the pork chop and the knife. The stove is in the kitchen. So the next action is to use the stove to fry the pork chop. The correct command is "fry pork chop on stove" but the game doesn't recognize it. Maybe the correct verb is "cook" or "heat". But the recipe says "fry". Alternatively, the user needs to put the pork chop on the stove. So the next action is "put pork chop on stove".

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, the user is really stuck here. They've tried multiple commands like "fry pork chop" and "use stove to fry pork chop", but the game isn't recognizing them. Let me think. The recipe says to "fry the pork chop". The user has the pork chop on the stove. Maybe the correct command is "cook" instead of "fry". Alternatively, the game might require using the stove's function. Since the user put the pork chop on the stove, the next step is to use the stove to cook it. The correct verb might be "cook" instead of "fry". Let me try "cook pork chop".

Okay, the user is trying to use the stove to cook the pork chop but the game says "You can't see any such thing." Maybe the stove isn't in the right place or the user needs to interact with it differently. The user has the pork chop on the stove, so maybe the correct action is to "cook" the pork chop using the stove. But the game doesn't recognize "cook". Alternatively, the user needs to use the stove's function. The correct command might be "fry" without specifying the stove. Let me try "fry pork chop".

Okay, the user is stuck again. They've tried multiple commands like "use stove to fry pork chop" but the game doesn't recognize them. Let me think. The recipe says to "fry the pork chop". The user has the pork chop on the stove. Maybe the correct command is "fry" without specifying the stove. Alternatively, the game might require using the stove's function. Since the user put the pork chop on the stove, the next step is to use the stove to cook it. The correct verb might be "cook" instead of "fry". Let me try "cook pork chop".
