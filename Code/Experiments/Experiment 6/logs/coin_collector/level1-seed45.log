I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Your task for today is to pick up the coin from the floor of the attic.

You're now in the attic. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.





There is a coin on the floor.
