Welcome to another fast paced round of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First, it would be a great idea if you could make an effort to go to the west. If you can get through with that, venture south. Once you accomplish that, make an effort to head west. With that accomplished, lift the coin from the floor of the closet. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Studio =-
You're now in a studio. You begin looking for stuff.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.
