You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

-= Kitchen =-
Well how about that, you are in the place we're calling the kitchen. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."



There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

There is a coin on the floor.
