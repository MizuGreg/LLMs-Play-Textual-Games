Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First off, make an attempt to venture south. If you can manage that, take a trip east. Then, make an effort to go east. With that done, make an effort to venture north. Next, head west. And then, try to move west. Okay, and then, move north. And then, try to move north. After that, attempt to travel north. Then, venture north. Then, attempt to travel north. And then, attempt to go east. Then, lift the coin from the floor of the attic. Once that's all handled, you can stop!
