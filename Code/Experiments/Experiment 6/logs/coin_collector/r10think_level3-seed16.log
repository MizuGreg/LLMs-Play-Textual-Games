Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First stop, make an attempt to venture west. With that done, head south. And then, pick-up the coin from the floor of the cubicle. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Steam Room =-
You have walked into a steam room. Not the steam room you'd expect. No, this is a steam room.



There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

>                                                                                                                                -= Steam Room =-0/1
AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go west
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Studio =-
A crooked sign tells you that you are now in the studio. You begin to take stock of what's here.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

go south

-= Cubicle =-
Look at that placard! What does it say? It says Welcome to the cubicle? Well that's cool.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked.

There is a coin on the floor.
