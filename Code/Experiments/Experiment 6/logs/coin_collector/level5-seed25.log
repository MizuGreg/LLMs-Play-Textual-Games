Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First, it would be a great idea if you could make an attempt to go west. If you can succeed at that, take a trip north. And then, travel east. Then, venture east. Okay, and then, retrieve the coin from the floor of the workshop. That's it!
