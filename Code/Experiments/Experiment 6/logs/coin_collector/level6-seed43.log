Welcome to another fast paced round of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to make an attempt to travel north. If you can get through with that, go to the east. Then, go north. Following that, take a trip north. With that done, head north. With that accomplished, pick-up the coin from the floor of the cookery. That's it!
