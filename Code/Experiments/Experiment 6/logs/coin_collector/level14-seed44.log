Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First off, move north. And then, try to go west. And then, head north. With that over with, take a trip east. Then, make an effort to take a trip east. Then, make an attempt to venture east. Then, move east. Following that, make an attempt to go north. Okay, and then, make an attempt to go to the east. If you can manage that, take a trip south. And then, make an attempt to go west. With that accomplished, head west. Then, venture south. And then, recover the coin from the floor of the cookery. And once you've done that, you win!
