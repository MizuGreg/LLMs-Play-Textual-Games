Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to venture north. And then, travel north. And then, venture east. Following that, attempt to go to the east. That done, go to the south. And then, attempt to go west. Next, venture north. Okay, and then, retrieve the coin from the floor of the cookhouse. Got that? Good!

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game called TextWorld. Their goal is to pick up the coin from the cookhouse and put it in a place. So far, they've moved through several rooms: bathroom, office, workshop, studio, chamber, cubicle, and study. The current room is the study.

The study has an exit to the east and north. The user's previous actions have been moving north, east, south, west, etc., following the initial instructions. The next step would be to check if they're getting closer to the cookhouse. Since the cookhouse wasn't mentioned in the study's description, maybe they need to explore further.

But the user's last action was going west from the cubicle to the study. Now, in the study, they can go east or north. The original goal was to get to the cookhouse. Maybe the cookhouse is in a different part of the map. The user needs to continue exploring. Since the study's description mentions an exit to the north, maybe that's the way to go. Alternatively, the east exit might lead to another room. But without more info, the safest bet is to try the north exit first, as that's unblocked. Alternatively, maybe the cookhouse is in the study, but the user needs to look for a coin there. However, the user's task is to retrieve the coin from the cookhouse, so they need to find where the cookhouse is. Since the cookhouse wasn't in the study's description, maybe they need to go further. But the user's next move should be to check the possible exits. The study has north and east. Let's check the north exit first. So the next action would be to go north.
</think>go north

-= Cookhouse =-
You find yourself in a cookhouse. A standard one.



You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

There is a coin on the floor.
