I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, move south. Once you get around to doing that, head west. And then, make an attempt to take a trip north. And then, retrieve the coin from the floor of the studio. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Canteen =-
You've seen better canteens, but at least this one seems pretty standard. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.



There is an unblocked exit to the south.

-= Attic =-
You've entered an attic.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.
