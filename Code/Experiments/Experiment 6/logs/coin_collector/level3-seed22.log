Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First off, head west. And then, try to take a trip west. With that done, recover the coin from the floor of the closet. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Pantry =-
Of every pantry you could have sauntered into, you had to come round a standard one.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.
