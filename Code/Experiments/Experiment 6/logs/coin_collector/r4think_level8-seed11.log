Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First stop, attempt to move south. With that done, attempt to go east. And then, take a trip north. Once you do that, make an effort to travel west. With that accomplished, take a trip west. Okay, and then, go to the north. And then, make an effort to move north. Then, pick up the coin from the floor of the cubicle. And if you do that, you're the winner!

You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game where they have to follow a series of directions to reach a goal, which is picking up a coin in a cubicle. The current scenario is in a sauna, and the user has already gone south, then east. Now they're in the sauna, and the next steps according to the initial instructions were to go north, then west, then west again, then north, and finally pick up the coin.

Looking at the current room description: the sauna has an exit to the north and west. The user's next move should be to go north as per the initial instructions. But wait, the user is in the sauna, and the previous steps were south, east, then sauna. The next step in the original plan was to go north from the sauna. But the user's last action was going east, which led them to the sauna. Now, the next step according to the original instructions is to go north. However, the user's next action should be to go north from the sauna. But the user might have to check if that's the correct path. The user is asking if they're on the right track, so I need to confirm that going north from the sauna is the correct next step. The sauna's description says there's an exit to the north and west. So going north would be the next step. Then, after going north, the user would be in the next room, which might be the kitchen again or another area. But according to the original plan, after going north from the sauna, the next step is to go west. However, the user's next action should be to go north first. The user's next command should be "go north" to proceed.
</think>go north

-= Studio =-

You've just walked into an office. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

You arrive in a cookhouse. An ordinary kind of place. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unblocked exit to the north.

Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game where they have to follow a series of directions to reach a goal, which is picking up a coin in a cubicle. The current scenario is in a cookhouse, and the user has already gone south, east, north, west, and now west again. The next steps according to the initial instructions were to go north, then west, then west again, then north, and finally pick up the coin.

Looking at the current room description: the cookhouse has an exit to the east and north. The user's next move should be to go north as per the original plan. But the user is in the cookhouse, and the previous steps were west. The next step in the original plan after going west from the office was to go north in the cookhouse. So the user should go north here. The user is asking if they're on the right track, so I need to confirm that going north from the cookhouse is the correct next step. The cookhouse's description says there's an exit to the north, so going north makes sense. Then, after going north, the user would be in the next room, which might be the kitchen or another area. But according to the original plan, after going north from the cookhouse, the next step is to go north again. Wait, the original instructions said after going west twice, then north, then north again. So maybe after going north from the cookhouse, the next step is to go north again. But the user's next action should be to go north from the cookhouse. The user's next command should be "go north".
