Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First off, try to take a trip north. Next, try to move west. Then, try to go to the north. And then, take a trip west. With that done, try to head north. After that, lift the coin from the floor of the cellar. Alright, thanks!
