Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game, and they've followed the instructions to move west, south, east, and then east again. Now they're in the Pantry, which is room 6. The goal was to lift the coin from the floor of the pantry and then win.

So far, the user has been moving through the rooms as directed. The current room is the Pantry, and there's a coin on the floor. The next step according to the initial instructions was to lift the coin. The user hasn't done that yet. The previous actions were all about moving through the rooms, and now they need to interact with the coin.

The user's next action should be to pick up the coin. The command would be "take coin" or "lift coin". Since the game mentions "lift the coin from the floor", using "lift" might be more accurate. But in many text adventures, "take" is the standard command. However, the exact wording in the game's context is important. The prompt says "lift the coin from the floor of the pantry", so maybe "lift" is the correct verb here.

Wait, the user is in the Pantry, and the coin is on the floor. So the correct action is to lift the coin. The next step after that would be to win. So the next command should be "lift coin".

That's not a verb I recognise.
