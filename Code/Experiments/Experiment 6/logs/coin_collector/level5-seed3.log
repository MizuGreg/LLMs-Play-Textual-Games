Welcome to TextWorld! First off, venture north. And then, take a trip east. Then, move east. After that, make an effort to take a trip south. Okay, and then, pick up the coin from the floor of the laundromat. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Shower =-
You've just shown up in a shower.



There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

>                                                                                                                                -= Shower =-0/1

-= Basement =-
I am sorry to announce that you are now in the basement. You begin looking for stuff.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.



>                                                                                                                                -= Basement =-0/2
Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing a text-based game called TextWorld. The current scenario is in the basement, and they've been given directions to move north, then east, east again, south, and pick up a coin. The user is now asking if they're making the right moves and if they're close to the goal.

First, I need to recall the previous steps. The user started in the shower, went north to the basement. The next steps according to the initial instructions were to go east twice, then south, and pick up the coin. The user is now in the basement, and the next action after going north was to go east. But the user is asking if they're on the right track.

Looking at the current environment: the basement has exits to the north (which was already gone), east, and south. The user's next step after going north was to go east. The initial instructions said to go east twice, then south. So after the first east, they should go east again. Then south. Then pick up the coin.

The user is asking if they're close. The answer is yes, but they need to follow the steps. The next action should be to go east again. The user's previous action was going north, then the next step is east. But the user is now in the basement, and the next step is to go east again. So the correct next command is "go east".

Wait, the user's last action was "go north", which took them to the basement. The next instruction was to go east. But the user is now in the basement and the next step is to go east again. The user is asking if they're making the right moves, so the assistant should confirm that they are and proceed with the next action. The next action after going north is east, then east again, then south. So the next command should be "go east".
</think>go east

-= Bedroom =-
You find yourself in a bedroom. An usual kind of place.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.



>                                                                                                                                -= Bedroom =-0/3
Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user has been moving through different rooms in the game: first the shower, then the basement, and now the bedroom. The original instructions were to go north, then east twice, then south, and pick up the coin in the laundromat.

Wait, the current room is the bedroom. The user's previous actions were go north, then east. Now, in the bedroom, the options are east or west. The original plan was to go east twice. But after the first east from the basement, they were in the bedroom. So maybe the next step is to go east again from the bedroom. But the prompt here says "You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west." So maybe east is the correct direction here. But the user's next action should be to go east again. But the user's previous action was go east, leading to the bedroom. So maybe the next step is to go east again. But the user's next action is to go east again. However, the original plan was to go east twice. Wait, the initial instructions were: venture north, then take a trip east, then move east again. Then south, then pick up the coin. So after the bedroom, going east again would be the next step. But the user is in the bedroom now. So the next action should be go east. But the user has to make sure that they are following the original plan. So the answer is go east again.
</think>go east
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Kitchenette =-
You find yourself in a standard kind of place. That is to say, you're in a kitchenette. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?



You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.



>                                                                                                                                -= Kitchenette =-0/4

Okay, let's see. The user has been moving through different rooms in the game: shower, basement, bedroom, kitchenette. The original instructions were to go north, then east twice, then south, and pick up the coin in the laundromat. Wait, but the current location is the kitchenette. Let me check the steps again.

First, they were told to venture north (which they did, from shower to basement). Then take a trip east (from basement to bedroom), then move east again (from bedroom to kitchenette). Then take a trip south. But the kitchenette's south exit is unguarded. So maybe from kitchenette, going south would take them back towards the basement or another area. But the original goal was to pick up the coin in the laundromat. Wait, the initial welcome message mentioned a laundromat. But so far, the user hasn't encountered that yet. Maybe the laundromat is in a different part of the map.

Wait, the user is now in the kitchenette. The next step according to the original plan was to take a trip south. So from kitchenette, going south. Let me check the current room's description. The kitchenette has south and west exits as unguarded. So going south from kitchenette would be the next step. Then, after that, they need to pick up the coin in the laundromat. But the user hasn't mentioned the laundromat yet. Maybe after moving south from kitchenette, they'll reach the laundromat. Alternatively, maybe the coin is in the basement or another room. But according to the initial instructions, the coin is in the laundromat. So the user needs to navigate to the laundromat, which might be south from the kitchenette. Let me check the previous rooms. The basement was north of the shower, then bedroom east of basement, kitchenette east of bedroom. So moving south from kitchenette would take them back to the basement, then maybe east again? Or perhaps the laundromat is a different direction. Wait, the initial welcome message said to "pick up the coin from the floor of the laundromat." So the laundromat is a specific location. Maybe after moving south from kitchenette, they'll reach the laundromat. Alternatively, maybe the laundromat is in the basement. But the user hasn't found it yet. The current step is to go south from kitchenette. So the next action should be 'go south' to proceed towards the laundromat. Then, once there, pick up the coin. So the user's next move is to go south.
</think>go south

-= Laundromat =-
I am sorry to announce that you are now in the laundromat.



There is an unblocked exit to the north.

There is a coin on the floor.


>                                                                                                                                -= Laundromat =-0/5

Okay, let's see. The user has been moving through different rooms in the game: shower, basement, bedroom, kitchenette, and now the laundromat. The original instructions were to go north, then east twice, then south, and pick up the coin.

So far, they've done: north from shower, east to basement, then east again to bedroom, then east again to kitchenette, then south to laundromat. Wait, but the original plan was after going south, pick up the coin. The laundromat has a coin on the floor. So the next step should be to pick up the coin. But the user's last action was going south to laundromat. Now, the prompt says there's a coin there. So the next command should be to take the coin. But the game's response says "pick up the coin from the floor of the laundromat." So the correct action here is to pick up the coin. The user hasn't done that yet. So the next command should be 'take coin' or 'pick up coin'. But the game might expect 'take coin' as the command. Let me check the previous interactions. The user was told to "pick up the coin from the floor of the laundromat." So the correct action is to take the coin. Therefore, the next command is 'take coin'.
</think>take coin
