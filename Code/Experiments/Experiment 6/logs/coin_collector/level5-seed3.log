Welcome to TextWorld! First off, venture north. And then, take a trip east. Then, move east. After that, make an effort to take a trip south. Okay, and then, pick up the coin from the floor of the laundromat. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Shower =-
You've just shown up in a shower.



There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Basement =-
I am sorry to announce that you are now in the basement. You begin looking for stuff.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Bedroom =-
You find yourself in a bedroom. An usual kind of place.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me think through this. The user is playing a text-based game where they have to navigate through different rooms and complete certain tasks. The current location is the Bedroom, and the previous actions were going north to the Shower and then east to the Bedroom. The user is now in the Bedroom and needs to decide the next move.

The user's question is whether they're making the right actions and if they're close to the goal. The original instructions mentioned venturing north, then east twice, then south, and picking up a coin in the laundromat. So far, they've done north (Shower), east (Bedroom), and then the next step was supposed to be another east. But in the Bedroom, the options are east or west. The user might be confused here. 

Wait, the original plan was after the first east (to Bedroom), then move east again. But in the Bedroom, going east is mentioned as an unblocked exit. So maybe the next step is to go east again from the Bedroom. The user might be following the correct path. The goal is to pick up the coin in the laundromat, which is probably in a different area. The user needs to continue moving east from the Bedroom to reach the next room, perhaps the laundromat. Alternatively, maybe the coin is in the basement or another area. But according to the initial instructions, after moving east twice, they should go south. However, the current location is the Bedroom, so maybe the next step is to go east again. The user should follow the initial plan step by step. So the next action should be to go east from the Bedroom. That's the logical next step based on the original instructions.
</think>go east

-= Kitchenette =-
You find yourself in a standard kind of place. That is to say, you're in a kitchenette. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?



You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.



>                                                                                                                                -= Kitchenette =-0/4
Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user has been navigating through the game, moving north, east, east, and now they're in the Kitchenette. The original goal was to pick up a coin from the laundromat. So far, they've gone through the Shower, Basement, Bedroom, and now the Kitchenette. The next steps according to the initial instructions were to move south after the two easts. But in the Kitchenette, the options are south or west.

Wait, the user's path so far: starting at the Shower, went north (but that was the first move), then east to the Basement, then east again to the Bedroom, then east again to the Kitchenette. Wait, no, the initial instructions said after venturing north, take a trip east, then move east again. Then take a trip south. So after the two easts (Basement to Bedroom to Kitchenette?), maybe the next step is to go south from the Kitchenette. But the user is now in the Kitchenette, and the options are south or west. The original plan was to go south after the two easts. So perhaps the next step is to go south from the Kitchenette. That would be the next logical step according to the initial instructions. The user needs to follow the sequence: north, east, east, south. So from the Kitchenette, going south would be the next step. Then, after that, they need to pick up the coin in the laundromat. So the next action should be go south.
</think>go south

-= Laundromat =-
I am sorry to announce that you are now in the laundromat.



There is an unblocked exit to the north.

There is a coin on the floor.
