Welcome to TextWorld! Here is how to play! First thing I need you to do is to try to move north. Once you finish that, make an effort to venture east. And then, make an effort to head east. And then, try to head north. Okay, and then, attempt to go west. Once you finish that, make an effort to move west. And then, go to the south. And then, make an attempt to move west. Then, pick-up the coin from the floor of the vault. Once that's all handled, you can stop!
