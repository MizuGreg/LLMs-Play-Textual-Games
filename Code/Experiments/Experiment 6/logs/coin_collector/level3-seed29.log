Welcome to TextWorld! Here is how to play! First off, go west. And then, move west. That done, pick-up the coin from the floor of the bathroom. Alright, thanks!

-= Scullery =-
You arrive in a scullery. An ordinary kind of place. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.



There is an unblocked exit to the west.

>                                                                                                                                -= Scullery =-0/1
AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go west
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Cellar =-
You arrive in a cellar. A typical one. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?



There is an unguarded exit to the east. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Bathroom =-
You are in a bathroom. It seems to be pretty usual here. Let's see what's in here.



There is an unguarded exit to the east.

There is a coin on the floor.
