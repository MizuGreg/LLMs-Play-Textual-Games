Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, you could, like, make an attempt to travel north. Okay, and then, take a trip east. Then, head north. With that done, move east. With that accomplished, attempt to head east. With that over with, pick up the coin from the floor of the studio. And once you've done that, you win!
