Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! First of all, you could, like, travel east. With that over with, venture east. And then, make an attempt to venture north. That done, take a trip west. With that accomplished, make an attempt to take a trip north. Following that, pick up the coin from the floor of the cellar. Alright, thanks!

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user has been moving through different rooms in TextWorld: shower, cookery, pantry, parlor, and now cookhouse. The original goal mentioned was to pick up the coin from the cellar. So far, the user has been moving east, then east again, then north, then west. Now in the cookhouse, the options are east (unguarded) and north (unguarded). The previous steps were following the instructions given in the environment descriptions, which seemed to be guiding the player through a path.

The user is asking if they're making the right actions and if they're close to the goal. The coin is in the cellar, so the path needs to lead to the cellar. The current room is the cookhouse. The next steps would likely involve moving towards the cellar. Since the cookhouse has an exit to the north and east, maybe moving north from here could lead towards the cellar. Alternatively, the east direction might lead to another area. But since the user has been moving in a specific path (east, east, north, west), maybe the next step is to go north from the cookhouse to continue towards the cellar. Alternatively, maybe the east direction from the cookhouse is the way to go. But the user's previous steps were following the directions given in each room's description. In the cookhouse, the instruction says to try going east (unguarded) or north (unguarded). Since the user hasn't picked up the coin yet, they need to find the cellar. The path so far might be leading them towards the cellar, but they need to check if the next move is correct. The user might need to go north from the cookhouse to proceed further. Alternatively, maybe the east direction is the right one. But without more information, the safest bet is to follow the directions given. The user's previous actions were moving in the directions suggested by the environment, so continuing that pattern would be logical. Therefore, the next action should be to go north from the cookhouse.
