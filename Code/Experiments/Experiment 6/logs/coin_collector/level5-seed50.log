Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First, it would be fantastic if you could try to move north. Once you finish that, make an effort to venture east. And then, make an effort to head east. And then, try to head north. Okay, and then, lift the coin from the floor of the launderette. Got that? Good!

-= Kitchenette =-
I just think it's great that you've just entered a kitchenette.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north.

-= Spare Room =-
You find yourself in a spare room. An ordinary kind of place.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the south.
