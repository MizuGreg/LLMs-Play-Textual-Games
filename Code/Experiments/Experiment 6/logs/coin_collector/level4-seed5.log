Welcome to another exciting game of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. Your first objective is to go to the north. And then, go to the east. With that over with, try to head south. After that, retrieve the coin from the floor of the chamber. Alright, thanks!

-= Cookhouse =-
You're not going to believe this, but you've just entered a cookhouse.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north.

GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Kitchenette =-
You are in a kitchenette. An usual one. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.



>                                                                                                                                -= Kitchenette =-0/2
Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they have to navigate through different rooms and complete tasks. The current room is the Kitchenette, and the user has already gone north from the Cookhouse. The next steps mentioned in the initial task were to go east, then south, and retrieve a coin.

Looking at the current room description, the user is told that going east is unguarded and suggested as an option. The user is also given the choice to go south. The user is asking if they're making the right actions and if they're close to the goal. 

The user's previous action was "go north", which led them to the Kitchenette. Now, according to the task, the next step is to go east. The prompt in the Kitchenette room says to try going east since that entrance is unguarded. So the next logical step would be to go east. 

The user is asking if they're on the right track. Since the initial plan was to go north, then east, then south, and then get the coin, going east next makes sense. The user hasn't retrieved the coin yet, so they need to proceed through the rooms. The coin is in a chamber, so after moving east, they might reach a room that leads to the chamber. 

Therefore, the correct next action is to go east.
</think>go east

-= Study =-
You are in a study. An ordinary one.



You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the west.



>                                                                                                                                -= Study =-0/3

Okay, let's see. The user has been moving through different rooms: first north to the Kitchenette, then east to the Study. The original goal was to go north, then east, then south, and retrieve a coin.

Wait, the initial instructions said the first objective is to go north, then east, then south. So far, the user has gone north (from Cookhouse to Kitchenette), then east (Kitchenette to Study). Now, the next step according to the original plan would be to go south from the Study. But the current room is the Study, and the prompt says "You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the west." So the user is in the Study, and the options are south or west. Since the next step in the original goal is to go south, the correct action here would be to go south. But wait, the user's previous actions were north, then east. The original plan was north, then east, then south. So after the Study, going south would be the next step. However, the user might have to check if that's the case. But according to the game's current prompt, the Study's south is unguarded. So the next action should be go south. Then after that, the next step would be to retrieve the coin. But the user hasn't mentioned the coin yet. So the next command is go south.
</think>go south

-= Chamber =-
You find yourself in a chamber. A standard kind of place. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north.

There is a coin on the floor.


>                                                                                                                                -= Chamber =-0/4

Okay, let's see. The user has been moving through different rooms in the game: first north to the Kitchenette, then east to the Study, south back to the Chamber. The original goal was to go north, then east, then south, and retrieve the coin.

Wait, the current room is the Chamber. The user's next step is to retrieve the coin from the floor. The previous actions have already taken care of going north, east, and south as per the original plan. Now, the coin is in the Chamber. So the next action should be to pick up the coin. But the game's prompt says "retrieve the coin from the floor of the chamber." So the command should be 'take coin' or something similar. But in TextWorld, the correct command might be 'get coin' or 'take coin'. Let me check the previous interactions. In the Chamber, the user is told there's a coin on the floor. So the correct action is to pick it up. The user's next move should be to take the coin. But the user's last action was 'go south' which led them to the Chamber. Now, they need to pick up the coin. So the next command is 'take coin'.
</think>take coin
