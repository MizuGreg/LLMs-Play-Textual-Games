Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. Your first objective is to make an effort to move south. And then, take a trip east. Then, try to go north. Okay, and then, make an effort to head north. And then, head west. With that over with, attempt to move north. That done, go to the east. Then, move north. After that, venture north. Next, try to travel east. Once you get through with that, make an attempt to go east. Then, go south. After that, pick up the coin from the floor of the cubicle. That's it!

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game where they have to navigate through different rooms and eventually pick up a coin. The current situation is that they're in the Cookery room again, with an unblocked exit to the east and a suggestion to go north.

Looking back at the previous steps, the user has been moving between the Bathroom and Cookery rooms. The original goal was to move south, then east, north, north, east, north, east, south, and then pick up the coin. But the user is getting stuck in a loop between the two rooms, which suggests that maybe the path isn't straightforward.

The user's current position is in the Cookery room. The next step according to the initial instructions was to go north again. However, the game's feedback indicates that there's an unblocked exit to the east. So, perhaps the correct next move is to go east, as that's the suggested exit. But the user's previous action was going north, which led them back to the bathroom. 

Wait, the user's last action was "go north" in the Cookery room, which took them back to the Bathroom. Then, the next instruction was to go south again, which brings them back to the Cookery. It seems like the game is designed to loop between these two rooms. The user might need to find a way to proceed further, but the current setup doesn't show any other exits except east in the Cookery and south in the Bathroom.

The user's question is whether they're making the right actions and if they're close to the goal. Given the loop, it's possible that the correct path requires moving east from the Cookery, which was mentioned as an unblocked exit. So, the next logical step would be to go east, which might lead to another room. However, the user's previous attempts to go east from the Cookery didn't result in moving further, but maybe that's because the game requires specific sequences.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go north again from the Cookery, but that led them back. However, the original instructions said after moving south, go east, then north, etc. So perhaps the correct sequence is to go east from the Cookery, then proceed north from there. But the user is stuck in a loop, so maybe the correct action is to go east now.

-= Dish-Pit =-
You are in a dish-pit. A typical one. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unblocked exit to the west.



>                                                                                                                                -= Dish-Pit =-0/5

-= Bedchamber =-
You find yourself in a bedchamber. A normal one. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.



There is an unguarded exit to the north. There is an unguarded exit to the south.



>                                                                                                                                -= Bedchamber =-0/6

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Bedchamber now, with exits to the north and south. The original goal was to navigate through various rooms, eventually picking up a coin in a cubicle. So far, they've moved between Bathroom, Cookery, Dish-Pit, and now Bedchamber. The next steps in the original plan were to go north, then east, north, etc. But the user is now in the Bedchamber, which has a north and south exit.

The user's previous actions have been moving between rooms, following the initial directions. The current room, Bedchamber, has an unguarded exit to the north and south. The original goal mentioned moving north, then east, so maybe the next step is to go north again. However, the user needs to check if that's the right direction. Alternatively, since the original plan had to go south after some steps, but the user is now in Bedchamber, perhaps going north is the correct next move to continue the sequence. The user might be approaching the correct path, so the next action should be to go north.

You are in a basement. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

The Basement has a south and west exit. The original instructions mentioned going south first, then east. So maybe the next step is to go south again. However, the user needs to check if that's the correct direction. Alternatively, since the Basement has a west exit, maybe that's part of the path. But according to the original plan, after the Bedchamber, the next was north, which led to Basement. Now, the user needs to follow the original sequence: after Basement, maybe go west or south. The original goal said after going south, take east, then north, etc. So perhaps the correct next move is to go south from the Basement to continue the sequence. But the user needs to make sure they're following the correct path. The answer should be to go south.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Basement again, with exits to the south and west. The original goal was to navigate through various rooms, eventually picking up a coin. The user has been moving between rooms, sometimes looping back. The current path seems to be oscillating between Bedchamber and Basement.

The original instructions mentioned moving south, then east, north, etc. But the user is stuck in a loop. Maybe the correct path requires going west from the Basement. The user needs to break the cycle and proceed further. Since the Basement has a west exit, perhaps that's the next step. But the user's previous action was going north, which led back to Bedchamber. Alternatively, the user might need to go south again from the Basement. However, the original plan had to go south first, then east.

The Closet has an east exit, which was mentioned as unguarded. The user's previous actions have been going back and forth between Basement and Closet.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Closet and Basement. They keep going back and forth between the two rooms. The original goal was to navigate through various rooms and pick up a coin. But so far, the user hasn't found the coin yet. The path seems to be repeating, so maybe there's a different approach needed.

Looking at the current room, the Closet has exits to east and north. The Basement has exits to south and west. The user has been going east from the Closet to the Basement, then west back to the Closet, creating a loop. To break this cycle, the user needs to find a different path. Maybe the coin is in one of these rooms, but the user hasn't checked properly.

The original instructions mentioned moving south, then east, north, etc. But the user is stuck in a loop. Perhaps the correct approach is to go north from the Closet instead of east. The Vault was mentioned earlier, which might be part of the path. Alternatively, the user might need to go south from the Basement to reach another room. However, the user has been going west and east repeatedly.

Since the user is in the Closet again, the next step should be to go north, which was mentioned as unblocked. That might lead to the Vault or another room. Alternatively, going east to the Basement again. But the user needs to break the loop. The answer should be to go north from the Closet to proceed further.

<think>
Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Closet and Vault, repeatedly going east and west. The original goal was to navigate through various rooms and pick up a coin. So far, the user hasn't found the coin, which is in the cubicle mentioned in the initial instructions. The path seems to be going in circles, so maybe the user needs to find a different approach.

Looking at the current room, the Vault has an exit to the east and a suggestion to go south. The user has been going back and forth between the Closet and Vault, but hasn't moved further. The original plan required moving south after some steps, but the user is stuck in a loop. The next step should be to go south from the Vault to break the cycle and proceed towards the coin. However, the user has been going east and west repeatedly. The correct action here is to go south from the Vault to continue the path towards the coin.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Closet and Vault, repeatedly going east and west. The original goal was to navigate through various rooms and pick up a coin. So far, the user hasn't found the coin, which is in the cubicle mentioned in the initial instructions. The path seems to be going in circles, so maybe the user needs to find a different approach.

Looking at the current room, the Vault has an exit to the east and a suggestion to go south. The user has been going back and forth between the Closet and Vault, but hasn't moved further. The original plan required moving south after some steps, but the user is stuck in a loop. The next step should be to go south from the Vault to break the cycle and proceed towards the coin. However, the user has been going east and west repeatedly. The correct action here is to go south from the Vault to continue the path towards the coin.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Closet and Vault, repeatedly going east and west. The original goal was to navigate through various rooms and pick up a coin. So far, the user hasn't found the coin, which is in the cubicle mentioned in the initial instructions. The path seems to be going in circles, so maybe the user needs to find a different approach.

Looking at the current room, the Vault has an exit to the east and a suggestion to go south. The user has been going back and forth between the Closet and Vault, but hasn't moved further. The original plan required moving south after some steps, but the user is stuck in a loop. The next step should be to go south from the Vault to break the cycle and proceed towards the coin. However, the user has been going east and west repeatedly. The correct action here is to go south from the Vault to continue the path towards the coin.
</think>go south
