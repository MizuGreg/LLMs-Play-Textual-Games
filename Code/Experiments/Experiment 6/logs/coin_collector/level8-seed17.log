Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First step, make an attempt to head east. Following that, make an attempt to venture south. Then, make an effort to take a trip south. And then, make an effort to travel south. If you can manage that, attempt to go east. Then, go to the south. Following that, attempt to take a trip west. And then, retrieve the coin from the floor of the bathroom. And if you do that, you're the winner!
