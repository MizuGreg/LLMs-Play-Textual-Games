Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First thing I need you to do is to make an effort to head west. With that done, move south. And then, head east. And then, move east. Next, make an attempt to venture east. Then, make an attempt to go to the east. Next, make an attempt to go north. And then, lift the coin from the floor of the cookhouse. That's it!

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing a text-based game where they have to navigate through different rooms and perform specific actions. The original task was to go west, then south, east, east, east, north, and lift the coin from the cookhouse. So far, the user has followed the directions: started at the laundromat, went west to the chamber, south to the closet, east to the canteen, east to the bar, and then east again to the studio. Now, the current room is the studio, and the prompt says to try going east or west. The user is asking if they're on the right track and if they're close to the goal.

First, I need to check if the current path aligns with the original plan. The original plan after the first few moves was to go east again, which the user did. But the next step in the original task was to go north and then pick up the coin. However, in the studio, the exits are east and west. The user hasn't gone north yet. So, the next logical step would be to go north from the studio. But the prompt says to try east or west. Wait, the studio's description says "You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded." So the user is in the studio, and the exits are east and west. The original plan was to go north after going east multiple times. But the studio's exits don't include north. Therefore, the user might have to navigate through the current rooms again. Alternatively, maybe the cookhouse is in a different part of the map. But according to the original task, after going east, the next step was to go north and then lift the coin from the cookhouse. However, in the current room (studio), there's no north exit. So perhaps the user needs to go west from the studio to find a north exit. Let me check the previous rooms. The user was in the bar, then went east to the studio. The bar had an exit to the west. So maybe going west from the studio would take them back to the bar, then perhaps north from there? But the bar's description says "You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west." So maybe the bar has a north exit? Wait, the bar's description says: "There is an unblocked exit to the east. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west." So the bar has an exit to the east and west. If the user goes west from the bar, they'd return to the canteen. Then from the canteen, maybe north or south? The canteen had exits to east and west. The closet had exits to east and north. The chamber had exits to east and south. The laundromat had a west exit. So perhaps the cookhouse is in a different area. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go back through the previous rooms to find the cookhouse. But the original task was to lift the coin from the cookhouse. The user hasn't done that yet. So maybe the cookhouse is in a room that's accessible through the current path. Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go north from the studio, but the studio doesn't have a north exit. Therefore, the user might have to go west from the studio to the bar, then north? Wait, the bar's description doesn't mention a north exit. The bar's exits are east and west. So that's not helpful. Maybe the user needs to go back to the canteen, then north? The canteen had exits to east and west. The closet had exits to east and north. So perhaps the user needs to go west from the studio to the bar, then west again to the canteen, then north to the closet, then maybe east to the kitchen? But the original task was to go north after going east multiple times. Alternatively, maybe the cookhouse is in the chamber? The chamber had an exit to the south. But the user is in the studio now. This is getting a bit confusing. The user's next action should be to go north, but since the studio doesn't have a north exit, maybe they need to go west first. But according to the studio's description, the user is advised to try east or west. The original plan was to go north after going east. But since the studio doesn't have a north exit, perhaps the user is supposed to go back through the previous rooms to find the correct path. Alternatively, maybe the cookhouse is in the studio, but the user hasn't found it yet. However, the task was to lift the coin from the cookhouse. So maybe the user needs to check the studio for the coin. But the studio's description doesn't mention a coin. The original task mentioned the cookhouse, which might be a different room. The user might need to navigate back to the cookhouse. Given the current room is the studio, and the next step in the original plan was to go north, but that's not possible here, the user might need to go west to the bar, then west again to the canteen, then north to the closet, then east to the kitchen, etc. But the user is supposed to go north from the studio. Since that's not possible, the next logical step is to go west from the studio to the bar, then west again to the canteen, then north to the closet, then east to the kitchen (if that's where the cookhouse is). However, the user's task is to lift the coin from the cookhouse. So perhaps the user needs to go back through the rooms to find the cookhouse. Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go north from the studio, but the studio doesn't have that exit. Therefore, the user might have made a mistake in the path. But according to the original instructions, the user was supposed to go west, south, east, east, east, north. So after going east three times (laundromat -> chamber -> closet -> canteen -> bar -> studio), the next step was to go north. But the studio doesn't have a north exit. Therefore, maybe the user needs to go back through the previous rooms to find a north exit. So the next action would be to go west from the studio to the bar, then west to the canteen, then north to the closet, then east to the kitchen (assuming that's where the cookhouse is). But the user hasn't done that yet. Alternatively, maybe the cookhouse is in the chamber. The chamber had an exit to the south. But the user is in the studio now. This is a bit confusing. The user's next action should be to go north, but since that's not possible, they need to go west. However, the studio's description says to try east or west. The user's original plan was to go north after going east. But since that's not possible, the user might have to go back. Therefore, the next action is to go west from the studio to the bar, then west again to the canteen, then north to the closet, then east to the kitchen. But the user hasn't done that yet. Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go north from the studio, but that's not an option. Therefore, the user might have to go west. But the user's next action is to go north, but that's not possible. So the correct next step is to go west from the studio to the bar, then west again to the canteen, then north to the closet, then east to the kitchen. But the user is at the studio now. So the next action is to go west.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's break down the user's current situation. They've been navigating through various rooms in the game, following a specific path: west, south, east, east, east, north, and then trying to find the coin in the cookhouse. So far, they've cycled through the Closet, Chamber, and back to the Closet again. The user is now in the Closet again, and the previous attempts to go north from the Chamber led them back to the Closet.

The original goal was to go west, then south, east, east, east, north, and lift the coin from the cookhouse. The user has successfully followed the initial directions but is now stuck in a loop between the Closet and Chamber. The cookhouse hasn't been located yet, so the user needs to find a way to reach it.

Looking at the current room (Closet), the exits are east and north. The user tried going north before, which led them to the Chamber, and then south back to the Closet. The Chamber has an exit to the east and south. The user needs to find a path that leads to the cookhouse. Since the original plan was to go north after several easts, but the user is stuck in a loop, maybe the cookhouse is in a different part of the map.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east from the Closet to the Chamber, then east again to the next room, which might be the cookhouse. The Chamber's east exit could lead to the cookhouse. Let's check the Chamber's description again: "There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the south." So, going east from the Chamber might be the way to go. The user was in the Closet, went north to the Chamber, then tried south again. If they go east from the Chamber, that's the next step. So the next action should be to go east from the Chamber to reach the cookhouse.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out what's going on here. The user is stuck in a loop between the Canteen and Bar. They keep going back and forth between these two rooms. The original goal was to go west, then south, east, east, east, north, and lift the coin from the cookhouse. But so far, the user has been moving between the Canteen and Bar, which doesn't seem to be progressing towards the cookhouse.

Looking at the room descriptions, the Canteen has exits to east and west, and the Bar has an exit to east and west as well. The user has been repeatedly going east and west between these rooms, which might be a mistake. The original plan was to go north after several easts, but the user hasn't found the right path yet.

Maybe the cookhouse is in a different area, and the user needs to find another route. The Closet, Chamber, and other rooms mentioned earlier might be part of the path. However, the user has been stuck in the Canteen and Bar loop, so they need to break free from that.

The next step should be to try a different direction. Since the user is in the Bar, maybe they should try going north or south instead of east or west. But the Bar's description says to try going west if they need an unguarded exit. Wait, the original task was to go north after going east multiple times. Perhaps the user needs to find a way to go north from the Bar or Canteen.

Alternatively, maybe the cookhouse is in the Chamber or Closet, and the user needs to explore those rooms again. The user has already been there before but might have missed something. However, the current path is not leading them there.

The user needs to change their approach. Instead of looping between Canteen and Bar, they should try going north from the Bar or Canteen. But the Bar's description doesn't mention a north exit. The Canteen's description also doesn't mention a north exit. So maybe the user needs to go back to the Chamber or Closet and try a different direction.

Wait, the user was in the Chamber earlier, which had an exit to the east and south. Maybe going east from the Chamber leads to the cookhouse. But the user is currently in the Bar, so they need to get back to the Chamber. To do that, they should go west from the Bar to the Canteen, then west again to the Closet, then north to the Chamber. Once in the Chamber, they can go east to reach the cookhouse.

So the next action should be to go west from the Bar to the Canteen, then west again to the Closet, then north to the Chamber, and finally east to the cookhouse. But the user is currently in the Bar, so the immediate next step is to go west to the Canteen. Then, from the Canteen, go west again to the Closet. Then, from the Closet, go north to the Chamber. From the Chamber, go east to the cookhouse. Once there, they can lift the coin.

But the user is stuck in the loop, so the next command should be to go west from the Bar to the Canteen. That's the correct direction to break the loop and proceed towards the cookhouse.

<think>
Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Chamber, Closet, and Laundromat. They keep going back and forth, which isn't helping them reach the cookhouse where the coin is. The original goal was to go west, south, east, east, east, north, and then pick up the coin. But the user has been moving in a cycle instead of progressing towards the cookhouse.

Looking at the current path: the user is in the Chamber, which has an exit to the east and south. The Closet has exits to east and north. The Laundromat has a west exit. The user has been going west from the Laundromat, then south to the Closet, north to the Chamber, east to the Laundromat again. This loop isn't getting them closer to the cookhouse.

The cookhouse wasn't mentioned in any of the room descriptions, so maybe it's in a different area. The user needs to find a different path. Perhaps they need to go east from the Chamber instead of south. The Chamber's east exit might lead to a room that's part of the cookhouse area. Alternatively, maybe the cookhouse is in the Closet or another room they've passed through.

The user's next move should be to try going east from the Chamber to see if that leads them to the cookhouse. If that doesn't work, they might need to explore other exits, but based on the previous loop, going east from the Chamber is the next logical step after the south exit. Let's try that.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Chamber, Closet, and Laundromat. They keep going back and forth, which isn't helping them reach the cookhouse where the coin is. The original goal was to go west, south, east, east, east, north, and then pick up the coin. But the user has been moving in a cycle instead of progressing towards the cookhouse.

Looking at the current path: the user is in the Chamber, which has an exit to the east and south. The Closet has exits to east and north. The Laundromat has a west exit. The user has been going west from the Laundromat, then south to the Closet, north to the Chamber, east to the Laundromat again. This loop isn't getting them closer to the cookhouse.

The cookhouse wasn't mentioned in any of the room descriptions, so maybe it's in a different area. The user needs to find a different path. Perhaps they need to go east from the Chamber instead of south. The Chamber's east exit might lead to a room that's part of the cookhouse area. Alternatively, maybe the cookhouse is in the Closet or another room they've passed through.

The user's next move should be to try going east from the Chamber to see if that leads them to the cookhouse. If that doesn't work, they might need to explore other exits, but based on the previous loop, going east from the Chamber is the next logical step after the south exit. Let's try that.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Canteen and Bar again. They keep going back and forth, which isn't helping them reach the cookhouse. The original goal was to go west, south, east, east, east, north, and then pick up the coin. But the user has been moving in a cycle instead of progressing towards the cookhouse.

Looking at the current path: the user is in the Bar, which has an exit to the east and west. The Canteen has exits to east and west. The user has been going east and west between these rooms, which is the same loop as before. The cookhouse isn't in these rooms, so the user needs to find another path.

The user needs to break free from this loop. The previous attempt to go north from the Chamber led them back to the Closet and then to the Laundromat. Maybe the cookhouse is in the Chamber or another room they've passed through. But the user hasn't found it yet.

The next step should be to try going north from the Bar or Canteen. However, the Bar's description says to try going west if they need an unguarded exit. The Canteen's description doesn't mention a north exit. So maybe the user needs to go back to the Chamber and try east again. But the user is currently in the Bar, so the immediate next step is to go west to the Canteen, then west again to the Closet, then north to the Chamber, and finally east to the Laundromat. From there, maybe they can find the cookhouse. But the user is stuck in the loop, so the next command should be to go west from the Bar to the Canteen.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Chamber, Closet, and Laundromat. They keep going back and forth, which isn't helping them reach the cookhouse where the coin is. The original goal was to go west, south, east, east, east, north, and then pick up the coin. But the user has been moving in a cycle instead of progressing towards the cookhouse.

Looking at the current path: the user is in the Chamber, which has an exit to the east and south. The Closet has exits to east and north. The Laundromat has a west exit. The user has been going west from the Laundromat, then south to the Closet, north to the Chamber, east to the Laundromat again. This loop isn't getting them closer to the cookhouse.

The cookhouse wasn't mentioned in any of the room descriptions, so maybe it's in a different area. The user needs to find a different path. Perhaps they need to go east from the Chamber instead of south. The Chamber's east exit might lead to a room that's part of the cookhouse area. Alternatively, maybe the cookhouse is in the Closet or another room they've passed through.

The user's next move should be to try going east from the Chamber to see if that leads them to the cookhouse. If that doesn't work, they might need to explore other exits, but based on the previous loop, going east from the Chamber is the next logical step after the south exit. Let's try that.
