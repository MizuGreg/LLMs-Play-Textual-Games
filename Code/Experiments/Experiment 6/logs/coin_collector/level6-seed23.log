I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First, it would be a great idea if you could make an effort to travel south. With that done, take a trip east. Once you finish that, make an attempt to go to the east. Okay, and then, travel east. Then, go south. Then, lift the coin from the floor of the vault. Alright, thanks!

You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.
