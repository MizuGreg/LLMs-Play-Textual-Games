I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is how to play! First of all, make an effort to head north. With that over with, make an effort to go east. And then, go to the east. Okay, and then, attempt to travel north. And then, recover the coin from the floor of the dish-pit. That's it!
