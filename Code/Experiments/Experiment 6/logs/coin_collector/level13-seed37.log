Welcome to another fast paced round of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to make an effort to head north. With that over with, make an effort to go east. And then, go to the east. Okay, and then, attempt to travel north. And then, try to head north. And then, make an attempt to head north. If you can get through with that, go to the west. And then, make an effort to go to the west. That done, make an attempt to go west. With that accomplished, move south. With that done, try to go south. And then, make an attempt to take a trip south. With that accomplished, recover the coin from the floor of the salon. Once that's all handled, you can stop!
