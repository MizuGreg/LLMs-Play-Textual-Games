I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! First of all, you could, like, head north. With that accomplished, go to the north. Then, make an effort to go north. Then, travel east. And then, make an effort to move north. Once you succeed at that, go to the north. With that accomplished, venture west. Once you get around to doing that, lift the coin from the floor of the study. And if you do that, you're the winner!
