Welcome to another exciting session of TextWorld! First, it would be great if you could head west. Then, make an attempt to take a trip north. And then, make an attempt to head east. Then, make an effort to travel north. And then, go north. If you can get through with that, recover the coin from the floor of the lounge. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Shower =-
You find yourself in a shower. An ordinary one. You begin to take stock of what's here.



There is an unguarded exit to the west.

-= Workshop =-
You are in a workshop. A normal one. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.

-= Kitchenette =-
You find yourself in a kitchenette. A normal kind of place.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.



>                                                                                                                                -= Kitchenette =-0/3
Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is in a text-based game called TextWorld. The goal is to recover a coin from the lounge floor after moving through certain directions.

First, the user started in the shower, went west to the workshop, then north to the kitchenette. Now they're in the kitchenette, and the next step is to go east because there's an exit there. The user is asking if they're on the right track and what their next move should be.

Looking at the current location: Kitchenette. The description mentions an exit to the east, unguarded, and suggests going south. But the user's previous actions were going north from the workshop, so maybe they need to continue moving in a specific direction to reach the lounge.

The coin is in the lounge, so the path likely involves moving through the kitchenette east to perhaps a hallway or another room leading to the lounge. The user has to follow the directions given in the environment. Since the kitchenette has an exit to the east, the next logical step is to go east. Then, maybe from there, they can proceed north to reach the lounge. The user has already gone north twice, so maybe after going east from the kitchenette, they can go north again to reach the lounge floor where the coin is.

So the next action should be to go east from the kitchenette. That's the unguarded exit mentioned. Then, after reaching the next room, they can try going north again to get to the lounge. The user's previous steps were going west, north, north, and now east. The next step is east.
