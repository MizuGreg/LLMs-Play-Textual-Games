Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First, it would be good if you could make an effort to move north. And then, make an attempt to move west. After that, try to head west. And then, travel north. With that done, head west. With that over with, try to head west. And then, attempt to go south. And then, make an effort to go to the east. If you can succeed at that, go south. Following that, make an effort to take a trip west. After that, try to move south. If you can get around to doing that, head west. After that, make an effort to move south. Okay, and then, retrieve the coin from the floor of the cookhouse. Got that? Good!

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north.
