Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, you could, like, head west. Then, make an attempt to take a trip north. And then, retrieve the coin from the floor of the canteen. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Shower =-
Ah, the shower. This is some kind of shower, really great ordinary vibes in this place, a wonderful ordinary atmosphere.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and retrieve a coin. The current room is the Workshop, and the user has been moving back and forth between the Shower and Workshop. The goal is to get the coin from the canteen floor.

Looking at the history, the user started by going west, then east, west again, and so on. The game's feedback suggests that there's an unguarded exit to the north in the Workshop. But the user hasn't found the coin yet. The challenge is to figure out the correct path to reach the canteen where the coin is located.

The user is asking if they're making the right moves and if they're close to the goal. From the previous steps, it seems like the user is stuck in a loop between the Shower and Workshop. The key might be to find the correct path to the canteen. Since the Workshop has an exit to the north, maybe that's the way to go. But the user hasn't tried going north yet in the Workshop. Alternatively, maybe the canteen is in a different direction. 

Wait, the initial instructions mentioned going west, then north, then retrieving the coin from the canteen. So perhaps after reaching the Workshop, the next step is to go north from there. The user has been going west and east, but maybe they need to go north from the Workshop to reach the canteen. Let me check the previous messages. 

In the Workshop, the game says there's an unguarded exit to the north. So the user should try going north from the Workshop. That would be the next logical step. The user hasn't tried that yet. So the correct action here is to go north in the Workshop.
</think>go north

-= Canteen =-
You are in a canteen. A normal one. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

There is a coin on the floor.
