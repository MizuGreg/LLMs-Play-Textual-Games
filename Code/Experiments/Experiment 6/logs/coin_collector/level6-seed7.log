Welcome to TextWorld! First stop, go south. Next, make an attempt to venture east. And then, try to go north. If you can get through with that, attempt to travel north. Then, head west. And then, recover the coin from the floor of the parlor. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Bedroom =-
Well how about that, you are in the place we're calling the bedroom. You begin to take stock of what's here.



You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

You've just sauntered into a lounge.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing TextWorld and has already gone south from the bedroom into the lounge. The current room is the lounge, and the possible directions mentioned are east and north. The user is asking if they're making the right actions and if they're close to the goal.

First, I need to recall the original instructions. The user was told to go south, then east, then north, then north again, west, and finally retrieve the coin in the parlor. So far, they've done south (from bedroom to lounge), then the next step was supposed to be east. But in the lounge, the options are east and north. The user might be confused because the original plan was to go east next, but the current room's options include east and north. However, the user's next action after entering the lounge was to go east, as per the initial plan. But the user is now asking if they're on the right track.

Wait, the user's last action was "go south" from the bedroom to the lounge. Now, in the lounge, the prompt says to try going east or north. The original plan was to go east next. So the user should go east. But the user is asking if they're making the right moves. The assistant's job is to confirm that the user is following the correct path and then suggest the next action. Since the user is in the lounge, the next step according to the original plan is to go east. So the next command should be "go east".

-= Dish-Pit =-
Wow! You're in a dish-pit.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game called TextWorld. The goal is to recover the coin from the parlor and win. So far, they've gone south from the bedroom into the lounge, then east to the dish-pit. Now they're in the dish-pit, and the options are to go north or west.

The user is asking if they're making the right moves and if they're close to the goal. Let me think about the path. The original instructions said to go south, then east, then north, then north again, west, and finally get the coin in the parlor. 

Currently, they're in the dish-pit. The next step according to the initial plan was to go north from the lounge, but they went east instead. Now they're in the dish-pit. The next step here would be to go north to return to the lounge, then maybe proceed further. But the user is at the dish-pit, and the options are north or west. The west exit is unblocked. But the original plan was to go north twice, then west. So maybe from the dish-pit, going north would take them back to the lounge, then from the lounge, go north again to reach the parlor. But the user is at dish-pit, so the next logical step would be north to get back to the lounge. But the user might be confused. Alternatively, maybe the west exit leads to another area. However, the original plan was to go north from the lounge, so perhaps the correct path is to go north from the dish-pit to the lounge, then north again to the parlor. But the user is at dish-pit, so the next action should be north. But the user's current position is dish-pit, and the next step is to go north. However, the user's last action was go east, which led them to dish-pit. Now, the next step should be north to return to the lounge. Then from the lounge, go north again to reach the parlor. But the user is asking if they're close. So the answer would be to go north from dish-pit to the lounge, then proceed as per the original plan. But the user is at dish-pit, so the next action is north. But the user's last action was go east, leading to dish-pit. So the next step is north. But the user is asking if they're close. The answer would be that they are on the right path, so next action is north.

-= Laundry Place =-
You've just sauntered into a laundry place. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text adventure game. The goal is to recover the coin from the parlor and win. So far, they've gone south from the bedroom into the lounge, then east to the dish-pit, north to the laundry place. Now, in the laundry place, the options are to go north or south. The prompt says "You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded." 

Hmm, the user is trying to follow the initial instructions: go south, then east, then north, then north again, then west, then get the coin. But in the laundry place, the next step according to the initial plan was to go north again. But the current options are north or south. Wait, the original plan was after the laundry place, maybe they need to go west? Or perhaps the path requires moving north again.

But the user's current position is the laundry place. The directions here are north and south. The initial plan was to go north, then west. But maybe the correct path here is to go north again. Let me check the previous steps. The user was in the dish-pit, went north to laundry place. Now, in laundry place, the options are north or south. The original plan was to go north, then west. So maybe the next step is north again. But the user's previous action was go north from dish-pit to laundry place. Now, in laundry place, the next step according to the initial instructions would be to go north again, then west. But the prompt here says that going north is suggested as an unguarded exit. So the user should go north again. But wait, the original plan was to go north, then west. But in the laundry place, the south is unguarded. Maybe the user is supposed to go south here? Wait, the initial instructions said after the laundry place, try to go north again. But the user is at the laundry place now. Let me check the original instructions again.

Original instructions: First stop, go south. Next, attempt to venture east. Then try to go north. Then, attempt to travel north again. Then head west. Then recover the coin.

So after the laundry place, the next step was to go north again. But in the laundry place, the options are north or south. The prompt says "You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded." So maybe the user is supposed to go north again. But the original plan was to go north, then west. So perhaps from the laundry place, going north is the correct direction. But the user is at the laundry place, and the next step is to go north again. However, the user might be getting confused. Alternatively, maybe the correct path is to go south from the laundry place. But the initial plan was to go north again. Wait, the initial plan was after the laundry place, go north again. But the user is in the laundry place now. So the next action should be go north. But the user's previous action was go north from dish-pit to laundry place. So maybe the next step is to go north again. But the user is at the laundry place, and the options are north or south. The prompt says that north is an unguarded exit. So the user should go north again. But maybe the correct path is to go west from the laundry place. Wait, the original plan was to go west after going north again. But in the laundry place, the options are north and south. So perhaps the user needs to go north again, then from there, maybe west. But the user is at the laundry place now. So the next step is to go north again. Therefore, the correct command is go north.

-= Washroom =-
You find yourself in a washroom. A typical one. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game where they have to navigate through different rooms and eventually recover the coin from the parlor. So far, they've gone from the bedroom south to the lounge, then east to the dish-pit, north to the laundry place, and then north again to the washroom. Each time, the directions given by the game have been about finding unguarded or unblocked exits.

In the current room, the washroom, the game says that for an unblocked exit, they should go south, and for an unguarded exit, west. The user's previous actions have been following the advice given, like going north when told to, so maybe they need to continue that pattern. But since they're in the washroom, maybe the next step is to check the west or south directions. However, the goal is to get to the parlor and recover the coin. So maybe the path isn't straightforward, and they need to find the right sequence of moves.

Wait, the original instructions mentioned going south, then east, then north, then north again, then west, and finally recover the coin. But the user has already gone south (from bedroom to lounge), east (to dish-pit), north (laundry place), north (washroom). Now, the next step according to the original plan was to head west. But in the washroom, the options are south or west. If they go west, maybe they can exit to the laundry place again? Or perhaps there's a different path. Alternatively, maybe they need to go south from the washroom to return to the laundry place and then find another way.

But the user is supposed to follow the original plan: after the initial movements, they need to go west from the laundry place, but in the current scenario, they're in the washroom. So maybe the next step is to go south from the washroom to return to the laundry place, then west to go back to the dish-pit? Or perhaps there's a different route. However, the game's current prompt says that in the washroom, they should go south for an unblocked exit or west for an unguarded exit. Since the user's goal is to reach the parlor, maybe they need to find the correct path that leads towards the parlor. But without seeing the actual layout, it's a bit tricky.

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go west from the washroom. Let's check the previous steps. The user was in the laundry place, then went north to the washroom. So perhaps the next step is to go south back to the laundry place, then west to the dish-pit, then north to the laundry place again? But that seems like going in circles. Alternatively, maybe the correct path is to go west from the washroom. Let me think: the original plan was to go south, east, north, north, west, then recover the coin. So after the washroom, maybe the next step is to go west, but the game's current prompt says that in the washroom, the unguarded exit is west. So maybe the user should go west from the washroom. But the user is in the washroom now, so the next action would be to go west. However, the user's previous action was going north to the washroom, so maybe the next step is to go west from there. But I need to follow the game's instructions. The game says in the washroom: "You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west." So the user can choose either direction. Since the original plan was to go west after the laundry place, maybe the user should go west from the washroom. But the user is in the washroom now. So the next action would be to go west. But the user's previous steps have been going north, so maybe the correct next step is to go west here. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go south to return to the laundry place and then proceed west from there. But the user's goal is to reach the parlor, so perhaps the correct path is to go west from the washroom. Let me check the original plan again: after the initial moves, they should go west. So maybe the user is supposed to go west from the washroom. Therefore, the next action is go west.

-= Parlor =-
Well, here we are in a parlor.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked.

There is a coin on the floor.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me figure out what to do next. The user is in the Parlor, and there's a coin on the floor. The goal was to recover the coin from the floor of the parlor. So the next step should be to pick up the coin.

But wait, the previous actions were moving through different rooms: bedroom, lounge, dish-pit, laundry place, washroom, and now the parlor. The user has to collect the coin here. The command should be to pick up the coin. However, in text adventures, sometimes you have to use specific verbs like 'take' or 'get'. But the user's previous actions were all 'go' commands. Maybe the game expects 'take coin' or 'get coin'. But the user's instructions say to only output the action, like "go north". So maybe the correct command here is 'take coin' or 'get coin'. But I need to check the game's possible commands. Since the user is in the parlor and the coin is on the floor, the correct action is to pick it up. So the next command should be 'take coin' or 'get coin'. But the user's previous actions were all 'go' commands. Maybe the game allows 'take' as a command. So the answer should be 'take coin'.
