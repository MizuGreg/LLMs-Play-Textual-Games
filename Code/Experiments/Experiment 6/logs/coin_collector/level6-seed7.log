Welcome to TextWorld! First stop, go south. Next, make an attempt to venture east. And then, try to go north. If you can get through with that, attempt to travel north. Then, head west. And then, recover the coin from the floor of the parlor. And if you do that, you're the winner!

Well how about that, you are in the place we're calling the bedroom. You begin to take stock of what's here.

-= Washroom =-
You find yourself in a washroom. A typical one. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game and has been moving through different rooms. The goal mentioned earlier was to recover the coin from the parlor and then win. So far, they've gone from the bedroom, lounge, dish-pit, laundry place, and now the washroom.

In the washroom, the available exits are south and west. The user is asking if they're on the right track and close to the goal. Let me think about the path they've taken. They started by going south from the bedroom, then east to the lounge, north to the dish-pit, south back to the laundry place, then north again to the washroom. Now, they need to decide between going south or west.

The original plan was to go south, then east, then north, then north again, then west, and finally retrieve the coin. But the current position is the washroom. From here, going south would take them back to the laundry place, and west would lead to another area. Since the coin is in the parlor, maybe they need to find a path that leads them there. However, the current rooms they've visited don't mention the parlor yet. Perhaps the parlor is connected through another exit. But in the washroom, the exits are south and west. If they go west, maybe that's a new area. Alternatively, maybe they need to check if the coin is in the washroom or nearby. But the user's goal was the parlor's floor. 

Wait, the initial instruction said to "recover the coin from the floor of the parlor." So the parlor is a room where the coin is located. The user hasn't reached the parlor yet. So from the washroom, going west might be the way to go, as the previous rooms had exits that led to different areas. Alternatively, maybe the parlor is connected through the laundry place or dish-pit. But the user is now in the washroom. The next step would be to check which direction leads closer to the parlor. Since the user's previous steps have been moving back and forth, maybe they need to find a different path. However, the available exits here are south and west. If they go west, that's a new direction. Let me check the previous rooms. The dish-pit had a west exit, which led back to the laundry place. The laundry place had a south exit to the dish-pit and a north to the washroom. So maybe the west exit from the washroom is a new area. Alternatively, maybe the parlor is connected through the west exit. Since the user's goal is to get to the parlor, they need to find the right path. But without more information, the next logical step would be to go west from the washroom, as that's the other exit besides south. So the next action would be "go west".

-= Parlor =-
Well, here we are in a parlor.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked.

There is a coin on the floor.
