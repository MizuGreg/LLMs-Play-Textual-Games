Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First, it would be good if you could make an attempt to venture south. If you can manage that, take a trip east. Then, make an effort to go east. With that done, make an effort to venture north. Next, head west. And then, try to move west. Okay, and then, move north. And then, try to move north. After that, retrieve the coin from the floor of the bathroom. That's it!
