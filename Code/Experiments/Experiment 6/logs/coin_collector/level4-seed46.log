It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to make an attempt to travel north. Okay, and then, take a trip east. Then, head north. With that done, lift the coin from the floor of the garage. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Spare Room =-
You've entered a spare room. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.



There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

-= Shower =-
You arrive in a shower. An ordinary one.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

-= Cookery =-
You've just sauntered into a cookery.



There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.



>                                                                                                                                -= Cookery =-0/3

-= Garage =-
You're not going to believe this, but you've just entered a garage. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.



You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a coin on the floor.


>                                                                                                                                -= Garage =-0/4
