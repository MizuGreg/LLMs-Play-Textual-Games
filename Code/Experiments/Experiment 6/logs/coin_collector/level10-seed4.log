Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text adventure game, and they've been moving through different rooms: shower, cookery, pantry, parlor, cookhouse, and now canteen. The original goal mentioned in the welcome message was to retrieve the coin from the scullery. So far, they've gone east, then east again, north, west, north, and now north again to get to the canteen.

The current room is the canteen. The提示 says to try going north or south. The user is asking if they're on the right track and if they're close to the goal. The previous rooms included the cookhouse, parlor, pantry, etc. The scullery wasn't mentioned yet. The coin is in the scullery, so maybe the next step is to find the scullery. 

In the canteen, the possible exits are north and south. The user needs to check if either of those leads to the scullery. Since the original path involved going east, then north, west, north, and now north again, maybe the next step is to check south from the canteen. Alternatively, maybe the scullery is north. But the user needs to follow the hints given in each room. The canteen's提示 says north is unblocked and south is an exit. So perhaps trying north first. But the user is asking if they're close. Since the scullery hasn't been reached yet, maybe they need to continue exploring. The next action would be to go north or south. The user's previous actions have been going east and north, so maybe the next step is to go north again from the canteen. Alternatively, maybe south. But the user's goal is to get to the scullery. Since the scullery wasn't in the previous rooms, perhaps the next step is to check the exits from the canteen. The user should go north or south. The answer should be the next command, so either "go north" or "go south". Based on the previous pattern, the user might need to go north again. But the user is asking if they're close. Since the scullery is the target, and the current room is canteen, maybe the next step is to go north. But the canteen's提示 says north is unblocked. So the next action is go north.

-= Workshop =-
You've entered a workshop.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in a loop between the Kitchenette and the Cellar. They've been going back and forth between these two rooms. The original goal was to retrieve the coin from the scullery. So far, they've passed through several rooms like the shower, cookery, pantry, parlor, cookhouse, canteen, workshop, and now the kitchenette and cellar.

The current room is the Cellar, and the提示 says to go south or west. The user has been going east from the Kitchenette to the Cellar, then west back to Kitchenette, and so on. Maybe the scullery is in one of these areas, but it hasn't been mentioned yet. The user needs to find the scullery and get the coin. 

Since the user is stuck in a loop, maybe they need to check if the scullery is in the south from the Cellar. The Cellar has an exit to the south, which is unguarded. If they go south from the Cellar, they might reach the scullery. Alternatively, maybe the scullery is in the east direction from the Kitchenette. But the user has been going east from the Kitchenette to the Cellar, so perhaps the scullery is in the south from the Cellar. 

The next logical step would be to go south from the Cellar to check if that leads to the scullery. The user needs to break the loop and proceed towards the scullery. So the next action should be "go south".
