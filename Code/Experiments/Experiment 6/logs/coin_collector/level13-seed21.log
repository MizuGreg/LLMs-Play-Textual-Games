You are now playing a life changing game of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to travel east. Okay, and then, travel north. And then, go north. Once you accomplish that, make an effort to go west. And then, attempt to venture north. With that done, attempt to go east. Following that, go to the south. Then, venture west. If you can do that, venture south. And then, go south. That done, attempt to head east. Following that, go south. And then, pick-up the coin from the floor of the scullery. Got that? Good!
