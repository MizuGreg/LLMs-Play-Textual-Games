Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game, and they've been given a series of directions to move around different rooms. The goal seems to be to reach a certain point, maybe collect an item like a coin from the shower, as mentioned in the initial prompt.

Looking at the current state, the user is in a Chamber (room 7) with exits to the south and west. The previous moves were going north, east, south, etc., through various rooms like the Closet, Workshop, Studio, Chamber, and Cubicle. The user is now in Chamber again, and the next step might be to continue exploring.

The user's last action was "go north" from the Cubicle, which led them back to the Chamber. Now, they're asked if they're on the right track and what their next move should be. The assistant needs to decide the next command based on the environment description.

In the current Chamber, the exits are south and west. The user has already been to the Cubicle (room 6) and the previous Chamber (room 5). The goal was to pick up the coin from the shower, which might be in a different area. The user needs to check if moving south or west would lead them closer to the coin. However, the shower isn't mentioned in the current room description. Maybe the coin is in a different room, and the user needs to explore further.

Alternatively, the user might be going in circles. The path from the Cubicle to the Chamber to the Cubicle again suggests that the user might need to try a different direction. Since the user has already tried going north from the Cubicle, maybe the next step is to go west from the current Chamber. But the Chamber's description says there's an exit to the west. So, "go west" would be the next logical step. Alternatively, going south from the Chamber might lead to another room, but the user needs to check if that's unblocked.

Wait, the Chamber's description says there's an unguarded exit to the south and an exit to the west. So both directions are possible. The user might need to try both. But the user's previous steps have been to go north, east, south, etc. Maybe the next step is to go west from the Chamber. However, the user's last action was going north, so maybe the next step is to go south again. But the user is in the Chamber, and the goal is to find the coin. Since the shower is mentioned in the initial prompt, perhaps the coin is in a room that's south or west from here.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check the west exit from the Chamber. The user has been moving around, and the next step would be to go west. So the next command should be "go west".

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Workshop and Closet rooms. They keep going north and south, which is leading them back to where they started. The original goal was to pick up the coin from the shower, but so far, the user hasn't encountered that yet.

Looking at the room descriptions, the Workshop has an exit to the east, and the Closet has an exit to the south. The user has been moving between these two rooms repeatedly. Maybe they need to try exploring the east exit from the Workshop. The initial instructions mentioned going east after some steps, so perhaps that's the direction they need to take to find the coin.

The user has been going north from the Closet to the Workshop and then south back to the Closet. This back-and-forth suggests they're not moving forward. The next logical step would be to go east from the Workshop, as that's the only other exit mentioned there. That might lead them to a new room where the coin is located. So the correct action here is to go east.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Cubicle again. They've been moving around between rooms, and the goal is to pick up the coin from the shower. So far, they've gone through several rooms like the Studio, Chamber, Closet, Workshop, etc. The current room is the Cubicle, which has an unguarded exit to the west and a north entrance.

The user's previous actions have been going back and forth between rooms, possibly missing the coin. The coin was mentioned in the initial prompt as being in the shower. Maybe the shower is in a room that's west from the Cubicle. The exit to the west is unguarded, so they should try that. Going west from the Cubicle might lead them to the shower room where the coin is. Alternatively, the north exit might lead to another room, but the user has already been there before. Since the coin hasn't been picked up yet, the next step should be to check the west exit. So the command would be "go west".

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Chamber and Cubicle again. They've been going back and forth between these rooms multiple times. The original goal was to pick up the coin from the shower, but so far, the user hasn't found it. The current room is the Chamber, which has an exit to the south and west. The user has already tried going south to the Cubicle and then north back to the Chamber.

Maybe the coin is in a different room that's not been explored yet. The user needs to try a different direction. The previous steps have been moving north and south, so perhaps they should try moving east or west from the Chamber. But the Chamber's description only mentions south and west. Wait, the Study room had an exit to the east and north, but that's a different room.

Alternatively, the user might need to check the west exit from the Chamber. The west exit leads to the Cubicle, which they've already been to. But maybe there's something in the Cubicle that they missed. The Cubicle's description mentions an unguarded exit to the west, so perhaps going west from the Cubicle again would lead to another room. But the user has already done that.

Wait, the initial prompt mentioned a shower. Maybe the shower is in a room that's east from the Study. The Study had an unguarded exit to the east. The user last went east from the Study to the Cubicle. Maybe the shower is in a room that's east of the Study, but the user hasn't checked that yet. However, the user's last move was going north from the Cubicle to the Chamber.

Perhaps the user needs to try going east from the Chamber. But the Chamber's description doesn't mention an east exit. The Study had an east exit, but that's a different room. The user is currently in the Chamber, so maybe they need to go south again to the Cubicle and then try a different direction. But the Cubicle only has a west exit. This is confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the coin is in the Study room. The user hasn't checked the Study's other exits. The Study had an unguarded exit to the north and east. The user last went east from the Study to the Cubicle. Maybe they should go north from the Study to another room. But the user is currently in the Chamber. To get back to the Study, they need to go north from the Chamber to the Study. Wait, the Chamber's north exit leads to the Study? No, the user was in the Study, then went east to the Cubicle, then back to the Chamber. So maybe the Study is north of the Chamber. If the user goes north from the Chamber, they reach the Study again. Then, from the Study, they can go east again. But the user has already done that.

This seems like a loop. The user needs to find a way to break the cycle. The only way is to check the east exit from the Study, but that's where they came from. Maybe the coin is in the Study, and the user needs to look around. But the Study's description doesn't mention the coin. The original goal was to pick up the coin from the shower, which might be in a different room. The user might need to explore the east exit from the Study again, but that's the Cubicle. Maybe the shower is in the Cubicle, but the user hasn't checked there yet. The Cubicle's description doesn't mention the shower, though.

Alternatively, the user might have missed the coin in a previous room. The user has been moving through rooms without noticing it. The coin could be in the Studio, Workshop, or Closet. But the user hasn't checked those rooms thoroughly. However, the user's last move was to the Chamber, so they need to go back to the Study and check other exits. The Study has an exit to the east (Cubicle) and north. Maybe the north exit leads to a room with the coin. But the user hasn't tried that yet.

Wait, the user is in the Chamber. The Chamber's north exit leads to the Study. So the next step should be to go north from the Chamber to the Study, then check the north exit from the Study. But the Study's north exit is unguarded. So the user should go north from the Study to another room. That might be the way to find the coin. So the next command is "go north" from the Chamber to the Study, then "go north" again from the Study. But the user is currently in the Chamber, so the next action is "go north".

Okay, the user is stuck in the Chamber again, trying to go north but can't. They've been looping between rooms without finding the coin. The original goal was to pick up the coin from the shower. Maybe the coin is in a room that's not been explored yet. The user needs to try different directions. The Chamber has an exit to the south and west. The user has been going south to the Cubicle and back. Maybe they should try the west exit from the Chamber. But the west exit leads to the Cubicle, which they've already been to. Alternatively, maybe the coin is in the Study, and the user needs to find another way there. But they can't go north from the Chamber. Wait, the Study was previously accessible from the Cubicle. Maybe the user needs to go west from the Cubicle again, but that's where they came from. This is confusing. The user might need to try a different approach, but the available exits are limited. The next possible action is to go south again, but that's the same as before. Maybe the game is designed to have the coin in the Cubicle, and the user just hasn't noticed it. The Cubicle's description mentions an unguarded exit to the west, so maybe the coin is there. The user should check the Cubicle again. But they're in the Chamber. So the next step is to go south to the Cubicle and look for the coin.

You find yourself in a cubicle. An usual one. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

However, the user hasn't looked inside the Bathroom yet. The Bathroom's description mentions an exit to the west, but the user hasn't tried that. However, the user is currently in the Spare Room, so the next step should be to go south to the Bathroom and then check if the coin is there.
