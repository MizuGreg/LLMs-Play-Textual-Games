You are now playing a profound game of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to try to take a trip east. If you can get around to doing that, try to move east. And then, make an effort to take a trip north. And then, attempt to go west. Once you accomplish that, pick up the coin from the floor of the cubicle. And once you've done that, you win!
