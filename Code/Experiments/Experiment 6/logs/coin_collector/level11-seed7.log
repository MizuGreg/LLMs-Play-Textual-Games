Welcome to TextWorld! Here is how to play! First, it would be good if you could go south. Next, make an attempt to venture east. And then, try to go north. If you can get through with that, attempt to travel north. Then, head west. And then, make an attempt to venture south. With that over with, move south. Then, try to go to the west. With that over with, go to the west. And then, try to move west. And then, pick up the coin from the floor of the cubicle. Alright, thanks!

Okay, let me try to figure out the best next move here. The user has been moving through different areas: starting in the Recreation Zone, then the Lounge, and now the Dish-Pit. The goal is to reach the original destination, which I assume is the exit or a specific location.

In the Dish-Pit, the提示 says to try going north or west. The user has been going south, east, and now maybe north or west. Let me check the previous steps again. 

Starting from the Recreation Zone, they went south to the Lounge, then east to the Dish-Pit. Now, in the Dish-Pit, the options are north or west. The user is asking if they're making the right moves. 

The original instructions mentioned going south, then east, north, west, etc. Maybe there's a pattern here. The user might be trying to navigate in a loop. But since the Dish-Pit has an unblocked exit to the north and west, perhaps the next step is to go north. But wait, the user is in the Dish-Pit. Let me think about the possible directions. 

If they go north from the Dish-Pit, maybe they'll reach another area. Alternatively, going west might lead them back to the Lounge or another part. But the user's previous moves were south, east, and now maybe north. The original goal might be to find the exit, so perhaps the correct path is to go north from the Dish-Pit. Alternatively, maybe the next step is to go west. 

But the user is asking if they're close to the goal. Since they've been moving through different areas, maybe they need to continue exploring. The next logical step would be to go north from the Dish-Pit, as that's the direction mentioned first in the prompt. So the answer should be "go north".

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user has been moving through different areas: Recreation Zone, Lounge, Dish-Pit, Bathroom, and now Washroom. The original goal was to reach the exit, probably by moving through the exits mentioned.

In the Washroom, the exits are south and west. The user has been going north from the Bathroom, which led them here. Now, they need to decide between south or west. The original instructions mentioned going south, then east, north, west, etc. But the current position is Washroom. The user is asking if they're close to the goal.

Since the Washroom has an exit to the south (which is unguarded) and west (also unguarded), maybe the next step is to go south back to the Bathroom, but that might not be helpful. Alternatively, going west could lead to another area. But the user's previous moves were trying to go north, east, etc. Maybe the correct path is to go west from the Washroom. But I need to check the previous steps again.

Wait, the user's path so far: Recreation Zone (south) -> Lounge (east) -> Dish-Pit (north) -> Bathroom (north) -> Washroom (now). The original goal might be to reach the exit, which could be in the north or west. But the user is in the Washroom. The exit to the west is unguarded, so maybe that's the way. Alternatively, going south back to the Bathroom might not be helpful. But the user is trying to move towards the original goal, which might be the exit. So, the next action should be to go west from the Washroom.

Okay, let's see. The user has been moving through various rooms: Recreation Zone, Lounge, Dish-Pit, Bathroom, Washroom, Parlor, and now Cookery. The goal is probably to find the exit or reach a specific location.

In the Cookery, the exits are north and south. The user is currently here. The previous steps involved moving south, east, north, west, etc. The original instructions mentioned going south, then east, north, west, etc. Now, in Cookery, the options are north or south. The user is asking if they're close to the goal.

Since the Cookery has an exit to the south (unblocked) and north, maybe the next step is to go north. But the user has been moving back and forth. Alternatively, going south might lead back to the Parlor. But the original goal might be the exit, so perhaps going north from Cookery is the right move. Let me check the previous directions. The user was in the Parlor, went south to Cookery. Now, in Cookery, the exit to the north is unguarded. So the next action should be to go north.

Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. The user has been moving between the Parlor and Cookery, going back and forth. The exits are always east and south from the Parlor, and north and south from the Cookery. The original goal was probably to reach an exit, but the user is stuck in a loop.

The user's previous actions were going south from Parlor to Cookery, then north back to Parlor, and so on. Since the exits are always available but the user isn't making progress, maybe the correct path is to go east from the Parlor. The original instructions mentioned going east once, so maybe that's the way to break the loop. Let me check the initial instructions again. The user was told to go south, then east, north, west, etc. So maybe after several loops, the next step is to go east from the Parlor to exit.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Washroom, and the previous action was "go south", but the game said that's not a recognized verb. Wait, maybe the correct command is "south" without the "go"?
But the user had been using "go" before. Hmm. Let me check the previous interactions. The user has been using "go" followed by direction, like "go south", "go east", etc. But the game might expect just the direction. Alternatively, maybe "south" is a valid command without "go".

Wait, the user just tried "go south" again, and the game said it's not recognized. So maybe the correct command is just "south". Let me try that. Alternatively, maybe the game expects "move south" or another verb. But the user is supposed to only say the command, like "south".

Looking back, the initial instructions said to reply with a short command like "go north". So maybe the correct format is "south" without "go". So the next action should be "south".

Okay, the user is in the Cookery room. The available commands include 'go <dir>' for moving directions. The previous attempts to move 'south' were rejected, but the correct command is just 'south' without 'go'. The user needs to move north or south from the Cookery. The original goal was to reach an exit, so moving north might be the right choice here. Let me check the previous steps again. The user was in the Parlor, went south to Cookery. Now, in Cookery, the exit is north or south. The correct command is 'north' or 'south'. Since the user is stuck in a loop, maybe moving north from Cookery is the way to go.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Parlor and Cookery. They keep trying to go south, but the game isn't recognizing it. The correct command is just "south" without "go". The original goal was to reach an exit, so maybe the exit is east from the Parlor. The user should try going east instead of south. Let me check the available commands again. The 'go east' command is valid. So the next action should be "east".

You've just shown up in a parlor.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.
