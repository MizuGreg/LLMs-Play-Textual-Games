Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. Your first objective is to go to the east. Following that, attempt to go south. After that, retrieve the coin from the floor of the attic. That's it!

-= Study =-
You're now in a study. You begin to take stock of what's here.



There is an unblocked exit to the east.

-= Cubicle =-
Well, here we are in a cubicle.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they need to follow specific steps. The original goal was to go east, then south, then get a coin from the attic. So far, they went east from the study, which led them to a cubicle. Now, in the cubicle, the prompt says they need an unguarded exit and suggests trying south or west.

Wait, the user's current location is the cubicle. The original plan was to go east first, then south. But after going east, they ended up in the cubicle. The next step according to the original plan was to go south. But in the cubicle, the options are south or west. The user needs to check if going south is possible here. The prompt says "You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south." So maybe going south from the cubicle is the next step. But the user is asking if they're making the right moves and if they're close to the goal.

So the user's current position is the cubicle. The next logical step would be to go south, as per the original plan. The user needs to confirm that going south is possible here. The prompt suggests trying south, so the correct action would be to go south. Then, after that, they might need to proceed to the attic to get the coin. But first, they need to navigate through the cubicle. So the next action should be "go south".
</think>go south

-= Attic =-
You've entered an attic. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked.

There is a coin on the floor.


>                                                                                                                                -= Attic =-0/3
Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?

So far, they've gone east to the cubicle, then south to the attic. Now, in the attic, they see a coin on the floor. The next step should be to pick up the coin. But the prompt says to only output the action, like "go north" or "pick up coin". The current location is the attic, and the coin is there. So the correct action is to pick up the coin. Wait, but in the game's context, maybe the command is "take coin" or "get coin". But the user's previous actions were "go east" and "go south". The attic has the coin, so the next step is to retrieve it. The answer should be "take coin" or "get coin". But I need to check the game's possible commands. Since the user is in the attic and the coin is on the floor, the correct command is "take coin".
</think>take coin
