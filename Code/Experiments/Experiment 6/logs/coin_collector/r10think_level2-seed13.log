Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is how to play! Your first objective is to make an effort to head west. With that done, lift the coin from the floor of the chamber. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Laundromat =-
You find yourself in a laundromat. A normal one. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.



There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

-= Chamber =-
You are in a chamber. A normal kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's here.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked.

There is a coin on the floor.
