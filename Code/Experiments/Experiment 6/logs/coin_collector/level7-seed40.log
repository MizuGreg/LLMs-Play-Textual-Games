I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! First thing I need you to do is to attempt to go to the south. And then, make an attempt to travel west. That done, try to go to the north. Then, make an effort to venture east. With that over with, try to head north. And then, try to go east. After that, retrieve the coin from the floor of the chamber. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Shower =-
You make a grand eccentric entrance into a shower. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.



There is an unblocked exit to the south.
