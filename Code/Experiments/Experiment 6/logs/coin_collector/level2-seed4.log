Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to travel east. With that over with, pick-up the coin from the floor of the cookery. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Shower =-
You arrive in a shower. A normal one.



There is an unguarded exit to the east.

-= Cookery =-
You arrive in a cookery. A typical one. You begin looking for stuff.



You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a coin on the floor.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in the Cookery room. The goal is to pick up the coin on the floor to win. The previous action was going east from the shower to the cookery. Now, in the cookery, there's a coin on the floor. The user needs to pick it up.

The prompt says to only output the action, like "pick up coin" or something similar. The user is asking if they're on the right track. Since they've already reached the cookery and the coin is there, the next logical step is to pick up the coin. The answer should be straightforward. Just pick up the coin. No need for extra steps. The user has to do that to win. So the command is "pick up coin".
