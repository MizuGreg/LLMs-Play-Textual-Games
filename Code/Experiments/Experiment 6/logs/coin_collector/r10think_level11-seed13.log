Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First stop, make an effort to head west. With that done, move south. And then, head east. And then, move east. Next, make an attempt to venture east. Then, make an attempt to go to the east. Next, make an attempt to go north. And then, attempt to venture west. And then, make an attempt to move south. With that done, try to travel west. Next, retrieve the coin from the floor of the bedroom. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Laundromat =-
Guess what, you are in the place we're calling the laundromat.



There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is in a text-based game called TextWorld, and their task is to navigate through different rooms and eventually retrieve a coin from the bedroom. The current room is the Chamber, and the user has been moving around between rooms like the Closet, Canteen, and Chamber. The goal is to get the coin from the bedroom.

Looking at the history, the user has been moving west, south, east, and north repeatedly, which suggests they're trying to find a path to the bedroom. The current room is the Chamber, and the exit to the east is unguarded. The prompt says to try going south from here. But the user is asking if they're on the right track and if they're close to the goal.

Wait, the original task mentioned going to the bedroom to retrieve the coin. The user has been moving through different rooms, but maybe they haven't reached the bedroom yet. The current room is the Chamber, and the exit to the east is unguarded. Maybe the bedroom is in a different direction. Alternatively, perhaps the user needs to find a way to get to the bedroom through the existing exits.

In the previous steps, the user tried going east from the Chamber, which led them back to the Canteen, then back to the Closet, and so on. The user might be stuck in a loop. The task mentions that after moving around, they need to retrieve the coin from the bedroom. So maybe the bedroom is in a room that's not yet explored.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to find a way to get to the bedroom by following the exits. The current room is the Chamber, and the exit to the east is unguarded. If they go east from the Chamber, they might reach a room that's closer to the bedroom. But in the previous steps, going east from the Chamber led to the Canteen, which then led back to the Closet. So perhaps the bedroom is in a different direction, like north or south from the Chamber.

Wait, the user is in the Chamber, and the prompt says to try going south. If they go south from the Chamber, they might reach the Closet again. But the Closet has an exit to the east and north. Maybe the bedroom is in one of those directions. However, the user hasn't found the bedroom yet. The task says to retrieve the coin from the bedroom, so the user needs to find that room.

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to move in a specific pattern to reach the bedroom. The original instructions mentioned moving west, south, east, east, then east again, then north, west, south, west, etc. But the user might be going in circles. The key is to find the bedroom and pick up the coin.

Since the user is in the Chamber, and the exit to the east is unguarded, maybe they should try going east again. But in the previous steps, going east from the Chamber led to the Canteen, which then led back to the Closet. Maybe the bedroom is in a different room. Alternatively, perhaps the user needs to go north from the Closet to reach the bedroom.

Wait, in the Closet, the prompt says to try going east or north. If the user goes north from the Closet, they might reach the Chamber again. But the user needs to find the bedroom. Maybe the bedroom is in a room that's not yet explored. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to find a way to get to the bedroom through the existing exits.

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to move in a specific order to reach the bedroom. The original task mentioned moving west, south, east, east, then east again, then north, west, south, west, etc. But the user might be repeating the same path. The key is to find the bedroom and retrieve the coin.

In the current state, the user is in the Chamber, and the exit to the east is unguarded. The prompt says to try going south. So the next step should be to go south from the Chamber. That would take them back to the Closet. Then, from the Closet, they can try going east or north. If they go north from the Closet, they might reach the Chamber again. But the user needs to find the bedroom.

Alternatively, maybe the bedroom is in the Canteen. But the Canteen has an exit to the east and west. The user might need to explore those. However, the task says to retrieve the coin from the bedroom, so the user needs to find that specific room.

Perhaps the user is supposed to move in a certain pattern to reach the bedroom. Since the user has been moving around, maybe they need to try a different direction. The next step after going south from the Chamber would be to go east again, but that leads back to the Canteen. Alternatively, going north from the Closet might lead to the Chamber again.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west from the Canteen to reach the Closet again. But the user hasn't found the bedroom yet. The task says to retrieve the coin from the bedroom, so the user must find that room.

In conclusion, the user is in the Chamber, and the next step is to go south as per the prompt. Then, from the Closet, they can try going east or north. But since the user is asking if they're close, maybe they need to continue moving in the correct direction to reach the bedroom. The next action should be to go south from the Chamber.

The current path seems to be looping between Closet and Chamber, so maybe the user needs to try a different approach.

In conclusion, the user is in the Closet, and the next step should be to go east, which is unguarded. That might lead them to the Canteen, but they need to find the bedroom. Alternatively, going north from the Closet might lead them back to the Chamber. The user needs to continue exploring until they find the bedroom and retrieve the coin.

<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out what's going on here. The user is in a text-based game called TextWorld, and their task is to navigate through different rooms and retrieve a coin from the bedroom. The current room is the Chamber, and the user has been moving between rooms like the Closet, Canteen, and Chamber. The goal is to get the coin from the bedroom.

Looking at the history, the user has been moving west, south, east, and north repeatedly, which suggests they're trying to find a path to the bedroom. The current room is the Chamber, and the exit to the east is unguarded. The prompt says to try going south from here. But the user is asking if they're on the right track and if they're close to the goal.

Wait, the original task mentioned going to the bedroom to retrieve the coin. The user has been moving through different rooms, but maybe they haven't reached the bedroom yet. The current room is the Chamber, and the exit to the east is unguarded. The prompt says to try going south. So the next step should be to go south from the Chamber. That would take them back to the Closet. Then, from the Closet, they can try going east or north. If they go north from the Closet, they might reach the Chamber again. But the user needs to find the bedroom.

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to move in a specific pattern to reach the bedroom. The original instructions mentioned moving west, south, east, east, then east again, then north, west, south, west, etc. But the user might be going in circles. The key is to find the bedroom and pick up the coin.

In the current state, the user is in the Chamber, and the next step is to go south as per the prompt. That would take them back to the Closet. Then, from the Closet, they can try going east or north. If they go north, they might reach the Chamber again. But the user hasn't found the bedroom yet. The task says to retrieve the coin from the bedroom, so the user must find that room.

Since the user is in the Chamber, and the exit to the east is unguarded, maybe they should try going east again. But in the previous steps, going east from the Chamber led to the Canteen, which then led back to the Closet. Maybe the bedroom is in a different direction. Alternatively, the user might need to find a way to get to the bedroom through the existing exits.

In conclusion, the user is in the Chamber, and the next step is to go south as per the prompt. That would take them back to the Closet, and then they can try going east or north. The user needs to continue exploring until they find the bedroom and retrieve the coin.

Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is in a text-based game called TextWorld, and their task is to navigate through different rooms and eventually retrieve a coin from the bedroom. The current room is the Chamber, and the user has been moving between rooms like the Closet, Canteen, and Chamber. The goal is to get the coin from the bedroom.

Looking at the history, the user has been moving west, south, east, and north repeatedly, which suggests they're trying to find a path to the bedroom. The current room is the Chamber, and the exit to the east is unguarded. The prompt says to try going south from here. But the user is asking if they're on the right track and if they're close to the goal.

Wait, the original task mentioned going to the bedroom to retrieve the coin. The user has been moving through different rooms, but maybe they haven't reached the bedroom yet. The current room is the Chamber, and the exit to the east is unguarded. The prompt says to try going south. So the next step should be to go south from the Chamber. That would take them back to the Closet. Then, from the Closet, they can try going east or north. If they go north from the Closet, they might reach the Chamber again. But the user needs to find the bedroom.

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to move in a specific pattern to reach the bedroom. The original instructions mentioned moving west, south, east, east, then east again, then north, west, south, west, etc. But the user might be going in circles. The key is to find the bedroom and pick up the coin.

In the current state, the user is in the Chamber, and the next step is to go south as per the prompt. That would take them back to the Closet. Then, from the Closet, they can try going east or north. If they go north, they might reach the Chamber again. But the user hasn't found the bedroom yet. The task says to retrieve the coin from the bedroom, so the user must find that room.

Since the user is in the Chamber, and the exit to the east is unguarded, maybe they should try going east again. But in the previous steps, going east from the Chamber led to the Canteen, which then led back to the Closet. Maybe the bedroom is in a different direction. Alternatively, the user might need to find a way to get to the bedroom through the existing exits.

In conclusion, the user is in the Chamber, and the next step is to go south as per the prompt. That would take them back to the Closet, and then they can try going east or north. The user needs to continue exploring until they find the bedroom and retrieve the coin.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out what's going on here. The user is in a text-based game called TextWorld, and their task is to navigate through different rooms and eventually retrieve a coin from the bedroom. The current room is the Closet, and the user has been moving between rooms like the Chamber, Canteen, and Closet. The goal is to get the coin from the bedroom.

Looking at the history, the user has been moving west, south, east, and north repeatedly, which suggests they're trying to find a path to the bedroom. The current room is the Closet, and the prompt says to try going east or north. The user is asking if they're on the right track and if they're close to the goal.

Wait, the original task mentioned going to the bedroom to retrieve the coin. The user has been moving through different rooms, but maybe they haven't reached the bedroom yet. The current room is the Closet, and the exit to the east is unguarded. The prompt says to try going south from the Chamber, but the user is stuck in a loop between the Closet and Chamber.

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to move in a specific pattern to reach the bedroom. The original instructions mentioned moving west, south, east, east, then east again, then north, west, south, west, etc. But the user might be going in circles. The key is to find the bedroom and pick up the coin.

In the current state, the user is in the Closet, and the next step is to go east or north. The prompt suggests trying north from the Closet. If they go north, they might reach the Chamber again. But the user hasn't found the bedroom yet. The task says to retrieve the coin from the bedroom, so the user must find that room.

Since the user is in the Closet, and the exit to the east is unguarded, maybe they should try going east again. But in the previous steps, going east from the Closet led to the Canteen, which then led back to the Closet. Maybe the bedroom is in a different direction. Alternatively, the user might need to find a way to get to the bedroom through the existing exits.

In conclusion, the user is in the Closet, and the next step is to go east as per the prompt. That would take them to the Canteen, then back to the Closet. But the user needs to find the bedroom. Maybe the bedroom is in the Chamber, but the user hasn't found it yet. The user needs to continue exploring until they find the bedroom and retrieve the coin.
