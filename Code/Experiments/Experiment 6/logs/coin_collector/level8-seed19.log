Welcome to another profound round of TextWorld! First thing I need you to do is to make an attempt to venture west. Then, travel west. If you can accomplish that, head south. With that over with, make an effort to move south. Then, attempt to head west. And then, move south. That done, make an effort to move west. Then, pick-up the coin from the floor of the kitchen. That's it!
