Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an life changing round of TextWorld? You do! Here is your task for today. First of all, you could, like, make an attempt to venture west. With that done, retrieve the coin from the floor of the studio. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Steam Room =-
This is going to sound unbelievable, but you've just entered a steam room. You begin to take stock of what's here.



There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Studio =-
Well, here we are in the studio. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a coin on the floor.
