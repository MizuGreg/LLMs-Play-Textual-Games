I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to make an effort to travel south. With that done, take a trip east. Once you finish that, make an attempt to go to the east. Okay, and then, travel east. Then, pick-up the coin from the floor of the dish-pit. Alright, thanks!

-= Sauna =-
I am sorry to announce that you are now in the sauna. The room is well lit.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.
