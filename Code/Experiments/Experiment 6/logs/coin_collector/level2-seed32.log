Welcome to TextWorld! First, it would be a great idea if you could make an attempt to take a trip south. With that accomplished, pick up the coin from the floor of the chamber. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Workshop =-
You're now in a workshop. Let's see what's in here.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go south

-= Chamber =-
I am sorry to announce that you are now in the chamber. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.



There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

There is a coin on the floor.
