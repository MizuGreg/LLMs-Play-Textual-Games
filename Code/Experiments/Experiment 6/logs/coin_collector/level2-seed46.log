Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. Your first objective is to make an attempt to travel north. Okay, and then, pick-up the coin from the floor of the shower. And if you do that, you're the winner!

You've just sauntered into a cookery. You begin to take stock of what's here.



There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded.
