I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! First off, try to move north. Once you finish that, make an effort to venture east. And then, make an effort to head east. And then, try to head north. Okay, and then, attempt to go west. Once you finish that, recover the coin from the floor of the launderette. Got that? Good!
