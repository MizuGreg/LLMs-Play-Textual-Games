Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. Your first objective is to go to the east. Following that, pick up the coin from the floor of the cubicle. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Study =-
Well I'll be, you are in the place we're calling the study.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east.

I am sorry to announce that you are now in the cubicle.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

There is a coin on the floor.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-

Okay, let's see. The user is in the study, and their first goal is to go east. They did that, and now they're in the cubicle. The next step was to pick up the coin on the floor. The current location is the cubicle, and the coin is there.

The user is asking if they're making the right moves and if they're close to winning. The previous action was going east, which led them to the cubicle. Now, they need to pick up the coin. The instruction says to pick up the coin from the floor of the cubicle. So the next action should be to pick up the coin. 

But the user is in the cubicle, and the coin is on the floor. The command should be "pick up coin" or something similar. However, in TextWorld, the correct command might be "take coin" or "get coin". But the exact wording depends on the game's commands. Since the user is in the cubicle and the coin is on the floor, the correct action is to pick it up. The user has to do that to win. So the next command should be "pick up coin".
