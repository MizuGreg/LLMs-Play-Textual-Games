Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First stop, try to take a trip north. Next, try to move west. Then, try to go to the north. And then, take a trip west. With that done, lift the coin from the floor of the washroom. Alright, thanks!

-= Shower =-
You arrive in a shower. A typical kind of place. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked.
