Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user has been moving through different rooms in the game: Laundry Place, Cubicle, Garage, Bedchamber, Basement, Cookhouse, and now Closet. The goal mentioned earlier was to pick up a coin from the studio. So far, they've been moving west and south, which has taken them through various rooms.

In the Closet, the exits are north and west. The user's previous actions were to go west, then south, and now they're in the Closet. The next step would be to check if there's a coin here or if they need to continue exploring. Since the Closet is described as an ordinary place with an unblocked exit to the north and west, maybe the coin is in one of the rooms they've already passed or in the next room they'll visit.

But the user's last action was going south from the Cookhouse to the Closet. The Closet's exits are north and west. If they go north, they'd return to the Cookhouse, which might not have the coin. Going west from the Closet would take them to another room, perhaps the Basement again? Wait, the previous rooms were: Closet (current), Cookhouse (previous), then Basement, Bedchamber, etc. Maybe the coin is in the Studio, which is a different area. The user needs to find the Studio and pick up the coin.

But the current room is Closet. The user needs to figure out the correct path to reach the Studio. The original instructions mentioned moving west, south, west, south, etc. Maybe the Studio is in a direction they haven't checked yet. Alternatively, maybe the coin is in the Closet, but the description doesn't mention it. The user needs to check the rooms they've visited so far. Since the goal is to pick up the coin from the studio, they need to find the Studio room and then collect the coin.

Looking at the rooms they've passed: Laundry Place, Cubicle, Garage, Bedchamber, Basement, Cookhouse, Closet. The Studio hasn't been mentioned yet. So perhaps the next step is to go north from the Closet to the Cookhouse, then check other directions. Alternatively, maybe the Studio is in the west direction from the Closet. But the Closet's west exit is unblocked. If they go west from Closet, they might enter another room. But the user hasn't been there yet. However, the user's previous moves were south from Cookhouse to Closet. So maybe the Studio is in the north or west direction from here.

Alternatively, maybe the user is close to the Studio. The original plan was to move west, south, west, south, etc. So after the Closet, maybe the next step is to go north to the Cookhouse again, then check other directions. But the user needs to find the Studio. Since the user hasn't reached the Studio yet, they need to continue exploring. The next action would be to go west from the Closet, which is unblocked. So the next command should be "go west".

-= Kitchen =-
Guess what, you are in a place we're calling a kitchen.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

I never took you for the sort of person who would show up in a studio, but I guess I was wrong.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked.

There is a coin on the floor.
