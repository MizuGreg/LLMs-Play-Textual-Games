Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an life changing round of TextWorld? You do! First off, go south. Next, make an attempt to venture east. And then, try to go north. If you can get through with that, attempt to travel north. Then, recover the coin from the floor of the bedroom. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Washroom =-
You've just sauntered into a washroom.



You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

-= Lounge =-
You arrive in a lounge. A typical kind of place.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unblocked exit to the north.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through a text-based game. The goal is to recover a coin from the bedroom and win. So far, they've gone south from the washroom into the lounge. The current location is the lounge, and the possible directions are east and north.

The user is asking if they're making the right moves and if they're close to the goal. The assistant needs to decide the next action. The previous steps were go south, then go east. Now, in the lounge, the options are east and north. The original instructions said to go south, then east, then north, then north again, then recover the coin.

Wait, the initial instructions said: first go south, then east, then north. If they can get through with that, attempt to travel north again. Then recover the coin. So after the first north from the lounge, maybe they're in another area. But the current location is the lounge, and the user is at the lounge. The prompt says in the lounge, there's an unblocked exit to the north. So maybe going north from the lounge is the next step. But the user is asking if they're close. The assistant should follow the original plan: after the first north, then another north. But maybe the user is at the lounge, and the next step is to go north. But the user is asking if they're making the right moves. The assistant should confirm that going north is the next step. Alternatively, maybe the user is at the lounge and needs to go east first. Wait, the initial instructions said after going south, venture east, then go north. So in the lounge, the user is supposed to go east first. Wait, the first step was go south, then make an attempt to venture east. So in the lounge, the user is at the lounge, and the possible directions are east and north. The user's next action should be east. But the user is asking if they're making the right moves. The assistant needs to decide whether to go east or north. According to the original plan, after going south, go east, then north. So in the lounge, the next step is east. But the user is at the lounge, and the prompt says "You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unblocked exit to the north." So the user is in the lounge, and the next step is to go east. But the user is asking if they're close. The assistant should probably go east as per the original plan. But the user is asking if they're making the right moves. The assistant should confirm that going east is the correct next step. So the next action is go east.

-= Dish-Pit =-
You've just sauntered into a dish-pit.



There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through this text-based game. The goal is to recover a coin from the bedroom and win. So far, they've gone south from the washroom into the lounge, then east into the dish-pit. The current location is the dish-pit, which has exits to the north and west.

The user's next move needs to be determined. The original instructions mentioned going south, then east, then north, and so on. But the user is following the path: washroom -> lounge -> dish-pit. From the dish-pit, the exits are north and west. The previous steps were going south (from washroom to lounge), then east (from lounge to dish-pit). Now, the next logical step might be to go north back to the lounge, but the user's goal is to get to the bedroom. However, the current location is the dish-pit. The user needs to find the path to the bedroom. 

But the user's previous actions were following the directions given in the initial prompt: go south, then east, then north. But in the current step, they are in the dish-pit. The initial instructions said to go north again. However, in the dish-pit, the exits are north and west. The user might need to check if going north from the dish-pit leads them closer to the bedroom. Alternatively, maybe the west exit is a different path. But since the user's goal is to reach the bedroom, perhaps the correct path is to go north from the dish-pit back to the lounge, then maybe east again? But the initial instructions said to go north again. 

Wait, the user's previous action was going east into the dish-pit. The next step in the original plan was to try to go north. So from the dish-pit, going north would take them back to the lounge. Then, from the lounge, maybe they can go east again? But the initial plan was to go south, east, north, then north again. But the user is currently in the dish-pit. The next action should be to go north, as per the original plan. So the answer is "go north".
</think>go north

-= Parlor =-
You find yourself in a parlor. A typical one. You start to take note of what's in the room.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.



>                                                                                                                                -= Parlor =-0/4

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in a text-based game. The goal is to recover a coin from the bedroom and win. So far, they've gone south from the washroom into the lounge, then east to the dish-pit, then north to the parlor. Now, in the parlor, the提示 says to try going north or south. The user needs to decide which direction to take next.

The original plan was to go south, then east, then north, and so on. But in the parlor, the options are north or south. The user's previous actions have been moving north when possible. But the goal is to get to the bedroom. Maybe the bedroom is in a different direction. Let me think about the room layout.

The washroom (south of lounge), lounge (east of washroom), dish-pit (north of lounge?), then parlor. Wait, maybe the parlor is connected to the bedroom via another path. Alternatively, maybe the bedroom is in the north or south direction from the parlor. The user needs to find the right path. Since the parlor's exits are north and south, perhaps the bedroom is in one of those directions. But the user hasn't found the coin yet, so maybe they need to explore further.

The next step would be to go north or south. The user's previous actions have been going north when possible. But in the parlor, the提示 says to try north or south. Let me check the previous steps again. From the dish-pit, they went north to the parlor. So maybe the bedroom is in the south direction from the parlor? Or maybe the north. The user needs to try both. But the user's next action should be based on the current room's description. The parlor's description says that if you need an unblocked exit, go north, and if you need an unguarded exit, go south. So maybe the user should try going north first. But the user's goal is to reach the bedroom. Alternatively, maybe the bedroom is in the south direction. However, the user hasn't found the coin yet, so maybe they need to explore more. The correct next step would be to go north, as per the提示. But I need to make sure. The user's previous steps were going north, so maybe continuing that path is the right move. So the next action is go north.

-= Bedroom =-
Well, here we are in a bedroom.



You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

There is a coin on the floor.


>                                                                                                                                -= Bedroom =-0/5

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and recover a coin to win. So far, they've gone from the washroom to the lounge, then east to the dish-pit, north to the parlor, and then north again to the bedroom. Now they're in the bedroom, which has a coin on the floor.

The current room is the bedroom. The user's next step is to recover the coin. The prompt says that if they do that, they're the winner. So the key action here is to pick up the coin. But the available commands mentioned are going south, which is unblocked. However, the coin is on the floor, so the correct action would be to pick it up. But the game's structure might require specific commands. Since the user has been moving between rooms, maybe the coin is in the bedroom, and the next step is to pick it up. The previous steps were all about moving through rooms, so the final step is to collect the coin. The user needs to pick up the coin, which is the goal. So the next command should be to take the coin.
</think>take the coin
