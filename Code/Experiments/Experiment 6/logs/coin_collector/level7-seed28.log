Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an fast paced round of TextWorld? You do! Here is your task for today. First off, travel east. With that over with, head north. Then, make an effort to travel west. Then, venture south. And then, make an effort to move east. Then, move north. That done, pick-up the coin from the floor of the shower.
