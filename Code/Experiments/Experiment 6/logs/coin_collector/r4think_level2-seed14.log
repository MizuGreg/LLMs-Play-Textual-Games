It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First stop, venture east. Then, pick up the coin from the floor of the cellar. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Office =-
Well how about that, you are in the place we're calling the office.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east.

-= Cellar =-
You find yourself in a cellar. An usual kind of place. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

There is a coin on the floor.
