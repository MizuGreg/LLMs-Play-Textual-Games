Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First stop, go to the north. And then, go to the east. With that over with, try to head south. After that, make an effort to head east. And then, make an attempt to go north. Then, take a trip west. Then, lift the coin from the floor of the bedchamber. And if you do that, you're the winner!

You've just sauntered into a garage. Let's see what's in here.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this TextWorld game and has followed some directions. The goal is to navigate through different areas, move in certain directions, and pick up a coin in the bedchamber.

First, they started in the Garage, went north to the Kitchenette. Now they're in the Kitchenette. The next steps according to the initial instructions were: go north, then east, then south, east again, north, west, then pick up the coin from the bedchamber.

Wait, the user has already gone north from the Garage to the Kitchenette. The next step in the original task was to go east. But in the current location (Kitchenette), the available exits mentioned are east and south. The user's next action should be to go east as per the original plan. But the user is asking if they're on the right track and what the next action should be.

The user's current location is the Kitchenette. The next step in the original instructions was to go east. So the correct next action is to go east. The user's previous action was going north from the Garage, which was correct. Now, they need to go east from the Kitchenette. The response should be "go east".

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game called TextWorld. Their goal is to navigate through different rooms, move in certain directions, and eventually pick up a coin from the bedchamber. So far, they've gone from the Garage to the Kitchenette, then to the Study. The current room is the Study.

The user is asking if they're making the right moves and if they're close to the goal. The original instructions mentioned going north, then east, south, east, north, west, then picking up the coin. Let me check the path they've taken so far.

Starting in the Garage, they went north to the Kitchenette, then east to the Study. The next step in the original plan was to go south from the Study. Wait, the Study's description says to go south or west. The user hasn't tried going south yet. The original plan after the Study was to go east again, then north, then west. But maybe the correct path is to go south from the Study to return to the Kitchenette, then proceed east again? Or maybe there's a different route.

Wait, the original task said: first go north, then east, then south, then east, then north, then west. So after the Study (which is the third room), the next step was to go east. But in the Study, the exits are south and west. So maybe the user needs to go south from the Study to get back to the Kitchenette, then go east again to the Garage? But the original plan says after Study, go east. Hmm, maybe there's a confusion here. Alternatively, maybe the Study is part of a loop, and the user needs to find the correct path to the bedchamber.

Alternatively, perhaps the user is supposed to go south from the Study to reach the Kitchenette again, then go east to the Garage, but that might not be the right path. The original task mentions going east from the Garage, then south, etc. Maybe the user is on the right track, but needs to continue following the original steps.

Wait, the original steps were: go north (from Garage to Kitchenette), then east (to Study), then south (from Study to Kitchenette?), then east (back to Garage?), then north (but Garage's north is the Kitchenette again?), then west (to Garage's west? Maybe the Garage has a west exit? But the initial Garage description said to go north. Maybe the user needs to go south from the Study to get back to the Kitchenette, then east to the Garage, then north again? But that seems like going in circles. Alternatively, maybe the Study's south exit leads to a different room.

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go west from the Study. The Study's description says there's an exit to the west. If the user goes west from the Study, they might reach the Kitchenette again. Then, from the Kitchenette, go east to the Garage, then north again? But the original plan says after Study, go east. But the Study doesn't have an east exit. The Study's exits are south and west. So maybe the user is supposed to go south from the Study to the Kitchenette, then east to the Garage, then north again? But the original plan says after Study, go east. That might not be possible. Maybe the user is confused.

Alternatively, maybe the Study's east exit is blocked, so the user needs to go south first. The original plan says after Study, go east. But if that's not possible, maybe the user needs to go south first. The user is at the Study, and the next step in the original plan was to go east. But the Study doesn't have an east exit. So maybe the user made a mistake in the path. The original plan might have a different sequence.

Alternatively, maybe the Study's east exit is unguarded, but the description says to go south or west. So the user needs to go south from the Study. Then, from the Kitchenette, go east to the Garage, then north again. But the original plan says after Study, go east. So perhaps the user is not following the original steps correctly. The user is at the Study, and the next step should be to go south. Then, from the Kitchenette, go east to the Garage, then north again. Then west. Then pick up the coin.

But the user is asking if they're close to the goal. So maybe they are on the right track. The user's current position is the Study. The next step in the original plan was to go east, but that's not possible. So the user should go south from the Study. Then proceed to the Kitchenette, then east to the Garage, then north again. Then west. Then go to the bedchamber to pick up the coin.

So the next action should be to go south from the Study. That's the correct move according to the original plan's steps. The user might have made a mistake in the previous steps, but the current position is the Study. So the next command should be to go south.

Okay, let's see. The user is navigating through different rooms in TextWorld. The goal is to lift the coin from the bedchamber. So far, they've gone from Garage → Kitchenette → Study → Chamber. The current room is the Chamber, and the directions mentioned are east and north.

The original task mentioned going north, east, south, east, north, west, then lifting the coin in the bedchamber. The user has already done some of these steps. Now, in the Chamber, they need to decide between east or north. The next step in the original plan was to go east again. But the user's current position is Chamber, and the next step in the task was after going south to the Chamber, then make an effort to head east. So maybe the next action should be east. But the user might need to check if the bedchamber is reachable. Alternatively, maybe the bedchamber is in a different direction. Wait, the original task said after going south, then east, then north, then west. So maybe after the Chamber, going east would lead to the bedchamber? Or perhaps the bedchamber is in the north direction. But the user hasn't found the coin yet. The coin is in the bedchamber's floor. So the user needs to reach the bedchamber. The current room is Chamber. The directions here are east and north. The original task's next step after going south was to go east. So maybe the user should go east from the Chamber. Let me check the previous steps again. The user went north (Garage → Kitchenette), then east (Kitchenette → Study), then south (Study → Chamber). Now, the next step in the original plan was to go east again. So the user should go east from the Chamber. That would be the next action. Then, after that, maybe they can proceed to north, then west, and finally lift the coin. So the correct next action is east.

Okay, let's see. The user is navigating through different rooms in TextWorld. The original goal was to lift the coin from the bedchamber's floor. So far, they've gone through Garage, Kitchenette, Study, Chamber, and Cookhouse. The current location is the Cookhouse.

Looking at the directions provided: in the Cookhouse, the exit to the west is unblocked, and there's an exit to the north. The user's previous actions have been going north, east, south, etc., but they haven't found the bedchamber yet. The bedchamber was mentioned in the initial task, so maybe the path requires moving through more rooms.

The user's next action should be to check if moving north or west leads closer to the bedchamber. Since the Cookhouse has an exit to the north and west, perhaps the bedchamber is in one of those directions. But the user needs to follow the path that leads to the bedchamber. Since the task mentions going to the north, east, south, east, north, west, and then lifting the coin, maybe the bedchamber is accessible from the Cookhouse's north or west exit.

But the user hasn't found the bedchamber yet. The next step might be to go north from the Cookhouse, as that's a direction mentioned in the task. Alternatively, maybe the bedchamber is in the west. However, the user needs to follow the sequence of movements given in the original task. The original task said: go north, east, south, east, north, west. So after the Cookhouse, the next step would be to go north again, as per the sequence. But the user is at Cookhouse, and the exit to the north is unguarded. So the next action should be to go north. However, the user's previous action was going east to reach Cookhouse. Wait, the original task said after going south (from Study to Chamber), then east (to Cookhouse?), then maybe north again? Or maybe the path is different.

Alternatively, maybe the bedchamber is in the west direction from Cookhouse. But the user's task mentions going west after some steps. The original task says: "then, take a trip west. Then, lift the coin from the floor of the bedchamber." So maybe after some steps, the user needs to go west to reach the bedchamber. But the current location is Cookhouse. So perhaps the next step is to go west from Cookhouse, but the user needs to check if that's the right direction. However, the user's previous actions have been moving in different directions, and the bedchamber hasn't been found yet. The user needs to continue moving according to the original plan, which was to go north, east, south, east, north, west. So after Cookhouse, the next step would be to go north again. But the user is in Cookhouse, and the exit to the north is unguarded. So the next action should be to go north. However, the user might need to check if that's the correct path. Alternatively, maybe the bedchamber is in the west direction. But the original task says after going north, east, south, east, north, west. So after Cookhouse, the next step would be to go north again. But the user is at Cookhouse, so maybe the next action is to go north. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west from Cookhouse. But the original task says after going north, east, south, east, north, west. So the sequence is: after the Cookhouse, the next step is to go west. Wait, the original task says: "Then, take a trip west. Then, lift the coin from the floor of the bedchamber." So maybe after reaching the Cookhouse, the user needs to go west. But the user is at Cookhouse, and the exit to the west is unblocked. So the next action should be to go west. But the user's previous steps were going north, east, south, east, north. Then, the next step is west. So the user is in Cookhouse, and the next action is to go west. But the user's current location is Cookhouse, and the exit to the west is unblocked. So the next action is go west. However, the user's previous action was going east to reach Cookhouse. So the next step would be to go west from Cookhouse. But the user needs to follow the original plan. The original plan says after going north, east, south, east, north, west. So after Cookhouse, the next step is west. Therefore, the correct next action is to go west.

Okay, let's see. The user has been moving through different rooms in the game: garage, kitchenette, study, chamber, cookhouse, and back to chamber. The goal was to navigate through the rooms and then lift the coin from the bedchamber.

So far, they've gone north, east, south, east, west, which brought them back to the chamber. The next step mentioned in the original task was to "lift the coin from the floor of the bedchamber." But the current location is the chamber, not the bedchamber. The user hasn't found the bedchamber yet. 

Looking at the current room description for the chamber, the exits are east and north. The user needs to find the bedchamber. Maybe the bedchamber is connected to the chamber via one of these exits. The original task mentioned going north, east, south, east, north, west, then lifting the coin. But the user is stuck in the chamber again. 

Wait, the user's last action was go west, which brought them back to the chamber. The chamber's exits are east and north. Maybe the bedchamber is accessible from the north or east exit. The user needs to try going north or east again to reach the bedchamber. The next step would be to go north or east from the chamber. Let's check the previous steps. 

In the cookhouse, the exit was north and west. Then going west led back to the chamber. So perhaps the bedchamber is north of the chamber. The user needs to go north from the chamber to reach the bedchamber. Then, once there, lift the coin. 

So the next action should be to go north from the chamber. That would take them to the bedchamber, where they can pick up the coin. The user hasn't reached the bedchamber yet, so the correct next step is to go north.

Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game where they have to navigate through different rooms and eventually pick up a coin in the bedchamber. The goal is to reach the bedchamber, lift the coin, and win.

So far, the user has moved through the Garage, Kitchenette, Study, Chamber, Cookhouse, and back to the Chamber. They've been moving around, trying different directions. The current room is the Study again, and the next step is to decide whether to go south or west. 

The original instructions mentioned that after moving around, the user needs to go to the bedchamber, pick up the coin. The user is now in the Study. The Study's description says there's an exit to the west. The user has been moving in a loop between the Chamber and Study. 

Wait, the original task said: "lift the coin from the floor of the bedchamber." So the bedchamber is a specific room. The user hasn't found the bedchamber yet. The current location is the Study. The exits from the Study are south and west. 

Looking back at the previous rooms, the Chamber had exits east and north. The Cookhouse had exits north and west. The Study is now the current room. Maybe the bedchamber is connected to the Study via one of the exits. The user needs to find the bedchamber. 

The user's next action should be to check the exits again. The Study has a south exit and a west exit. The user might need to go south from the Study to reach the bedchamber. Alternatively, maybe the bedchamber is in the west direction. But the user hasn't found the coin yet, so they need to explore further. 

Since the user is in the Study, the next logical step would be to try going south, as that's the exit mentioned first. Alternatively, maybe the bedchamber is in the west direction. But the user hasn't checked that yet. 

Wait, the user's previous moves included going north, east, south, west, and back. The bedchamber hasn't been reached yet. The user needs to find the bedchamber. The Study's exit to the south might lead to the bedchamber. Alternatively, the west exit from the Study might lead to another room. 

The user's next action should be to try going south from the Study. That's the next step in the sequence. So the answer is "go south".

Okay, let's see. The user has been moving through different rooms in the game: Garage, Kitchenette, Study, Chamber, Cookhouse, and back again. The goal is to lift the coin from the bedchamber. So far, they've been exploring and moving between rooms, but haven't found the coin yet.

Looking at the current location, they're in the Cookhouse. The提示 says to try going north, and there's an exit to the west. The user's previous actions have been going north, east, south, etc., but they need to find the bedchamber where the coin is. 

The original task mentioned going to the north, then east, south, east, north, west, then lifting the coin from the bedchamber. So maybe the bedchamber is in one of the rooms they've already visited. But they haven't found it yet. 

Since they're in the Cookhouse now, maybe the next step is to check the rooms around them. The提示 says to go north from the Cookhouse. If they go north, they might reach the Chamber again. But the coin is in the bedchamber. Wait, the user has been in the Chamber multiple times. Maybe the bedchamber is a different room. 

Alternatively, maybe the bedchamber is in the Study or another room. But the user hasn't checked all areas. The key is to find the bedchamber and pick up the coin. Since the user hasn't done that yet, they need to explore more. 

The next action should be to check the possible exits again. The Cookhouse has an exit to the west and north. The user might need to go west to check another room. But the previous steps have them moving back and forth. 

Wait, the original instructions said after moving around, lift the coin from the bedchamber. So maybe the bedchamber is in the Chamber room. The user is in the Cookhouse now. If they go north, they might reach the Chamber again. Then, perhaps check the bedchamber there. 

But the user hasn't found the coin yet. So the next step is to go north from the Cookhouse to the Chamber, then look for the bedchamber. Alternatively, maybe the bedchamber is in the Study. But the user needs to check all possible rooms. 

Since the user is in the Cookhouse, the next action should be to go north, as the提示 suggests. That would take them back to the Chamber. Then, from there, maybe check the bedchamber. So the next command is go north.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user has been moving through different rooms in the game, following a path that's been described as a loop. The original goal was to lift the coin from the floor of the bedchamber. So far, they've been moving between rooms like the garage, kitchenette, study, chamber, cookhouse, and now the bedroom. The current room is the bedroom, which has exits to the south and west.

The user's next action should be to check if they're close to the goal. The original task mentioned going to the north, east, south, east, north, west, then lifting the coin in the bedchamber. The user has been moving in a way that's been going back and forth between chambers and the study. Now, in the bedroom, which is part of the path mentioned in the original task.

Since the goal is to lift the coin in the bedchamber, the user needs to check if the bedchamber is the current room. But in the current description, the user is in the bedroom, not the bedchamber. The bedchamber might be a different room. However, the user's path has them moving through the bedroom, which might be adjacent to the bedchamber.

The user's next step should be to check the bedchamber. Since the bedroom has an exit to the south and west, maybe the bedchamber is in one of those directions. But the user hasn't checked that yet. Alternatively, maybe the bedchamber is the current room, but the description says "bedroom" instead of "bedchamber." However, the original task mentions the bedchamber, so perhaps the user needs to look for the coin in the bedchamber.

But the user hasn't found the coin yet. The task says to "lift the coin from the floor of the bedchamber." So the user needs to be in the bedchamber and then pick up the coin. Since the current room is the bedroom, the user needs to move to the bedchamber. The bedroom has an exit to the south and west. If the bedchamber is adjacent, maybe the user should check those directions.

But the user's previous actions have been moving through the rooms, and the current room is the bedroom. The next logical step would be to check the bedchamber. However, the user hasn't been told that the bedchamber is adjacent. So maybe the user needs to look for the bedchamber in the current room's description. Alternatively, maybe the bedchamber is the current room, but the description says "bedroom."

Wait, the original task says "the floor of the bedchamber," so the user needs to be in the bedchamber. The current room is the bedroom. So the user needs to move to the bedchamber. But how? The bedroom has exits to the south and west. The user might need to go to the bedchamber from the bedroom. But the user hasn't been told that the bedchamber is adjacent. So perhaps the user needs to check the exits again.

Alternatively, maybe the bedchamber is the current room, but the description is incorrect. But the user is in the bedroom. So the next step is to check the exits again. The user's next action should be to go to the bedchamber. But how? The user might need to move in a direction that leads to the bedchamber. Since the user is in the bedroom, and the bedchamber is mentioned in the task, the user should check the exits again.

Alternatively, maybe the user is already in the bedchamber, but the description says "bedroom." Maybe there's a mistake in the description. But the user needs to follow the task. The task says to lift the coin from the bedchamber. So the user needs to be in the bedchamber. The current room is the bedroom. So the user should check the exits again to find the bedchamber. The exits are south and west. The user might need to go south or west to reach the bedchamber.

But the user's previous actions have been moving through the rooms, and the current room is the bedroom. The next step would be to check the bedchamber. Since the user hasn't found the coin yet, the next action should be to move to the bedchamber. The user should check the exits again. The user is in the bedroom, so the next action is to go to the bedchamber. But the user hasn't been told that the bedchamber is adjacent. So the user needs to try moving in the directions that are available.

The user's previous actions have been moving in a loop, so maybe the bedchamber is in one of the directions. The user should try moving west or south from the bedroom. The user's next action should be to go west or south. But the user's task is to lift the coin in the bedchamber. So the user needs to be in the bedchamber. Therefore, the next action should be to move to the bedchamber. The user should check the exits again.

In the current room (bedroom), the exits are south and west. The user needs to check those directions. The user's next action should be to go west or south. Since the user is in the bedroom, and the bedchamber is the target, the user should move in the direction that leads to the bedchamber. The user's next action should be to go west or south. The user might need to try both directions. But the user's previous actions have been moving in a certain pattern. The user's next action is to go west or south. The user should choose one of those directions. Since the user is in the bedroom, and the bedchamber is the target, the user should try moving west or south. The user's next action is to go west or south. The user should pick one of them. The user's next action is to go west or south. The user should check which direction leads to the bedchamber. Since the user hasn't found the coin yet, the user needs to be in the bedchamber. Therefore, the user's next action is to move to the bedchamber. The user should go west or south. The user's next action is to go west or south. The user should choose one of them. The user's next action is to go west.

Okay, let's see. The user has been moving through different rooms in the game, following the directions given. The goal was to lift the coin from the floor of the bedchamber. So far, they've navigated through the garage, kitchenette, study, chamber, cookhouse, and now they're in the bedchamber.

The current room is the bedchamber, which has an exit to the east and a coin on the floor. The next step according to the original task was to "lift the coin from the floor of the bedchamber. And if you do that, you're the winner!" So the next action should be to pick up the coin.

But wait, the user's previous action was going west, which led them to the bedchamber. Now, they need to pick up the coin. The command should be "take coin" or "pick up coin". However, in TextWorld, the correct command might be "take coin" or "get coin". Since the coin is on the floor, the player needs to pick it up. The previous interactions show that the user is supposed to take actions like "go north", "go east", etc., so the next logical step is to pick up the coin. The user hasn't done that yet, so the next action should be to take the coin. The response should be "take coin".
