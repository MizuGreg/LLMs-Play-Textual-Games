Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First stop, make an attempt to go west. If you can succeed at that, pick-up the coin from the floor of the shower. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Studio =-
You're now in a studio. You begin to take stock of what's here.



There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

go west

-= Shower =-
Well, here we are in the shower. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east.

There is a coin on the floor.
