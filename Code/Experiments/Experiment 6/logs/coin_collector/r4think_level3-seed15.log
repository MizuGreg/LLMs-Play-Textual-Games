Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, you could, like, head west. Then, make an attempt to take a trip north. And then, retrieve the coin from the floor of the canteen. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Shower =-
Ah, the shower. This is some kind of shower, really great ordinary vibes in this place, a wonderful ordinary atmosphere.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

You're now in the workshop. You begin to take stock of what's here.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. There is an unguarded exit to the north.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game, and they've been moving between rooms. The goal is to retrieve a coin from the canteen's floor and win. So far, they've gone west from the shower, then east into the workshop, and then back west to the shower again. The current room is the shower, and the提示 says to try going west again.

Wait, but the user is asking if they're making the right actions and if they're close to the goal. Let me think about the game's structure. The initial instructions said to go west, then north, then get the coin. But the rooms seem to loop between shower and workshop. Maybe the coin is in the workshop? Or perhaps the canteen is another room they haven't reached yet.

But according to the current state, they're back in the shower. The workshop has an unguarded exit to the north, but the shower's exit is west. Maybe the canteen is north of the workshop? The user needs to get to the canteen's floor to retrieve the coin. So perhaps the correct path is: shower -> workshop (east) -> north to canteen? But the workshop's north exit is unguarded. So maybe after going east to the workshop, they should go north to the canteen. But in the previous steps, the user went west again, which brings them back to the shower. That might not be the right path.

Wait, the user's current position is the shower again. The提示 says to go west, but that's where they came from. Maybe they need to go east again to the workshop, then north to the canteen. But the user is confused because they're looping. The original goal was to go west, then north, then get the coin. But the rooms are structured in a way that moving east and west cycles between shower and workshop. Maybe the canteen is accessible from the workshop's north exit. So the correct sequence is: start at shower, go west (but that's where you came from?), wait, no. The initial instruction was to go west first. Then from the shower, go west again? But that might not make sense. Maybe the user is stuck in a loop and needs to find another way.

Alternatively, maybe the coin is in the workshop. But the user hasn't checked there yet. The workshop has an unguarded exit to the north, so maybe after getting to the workshop, they should go north to the canteen. But the user's last action was going west back to the shower. So the next step should be to go east again to the workshop, then north to the canteen. Then, once in the canteen, retrieve the coin. So the next action should be to go east from the shower to the workshop, then north to the canteen. But the user is at the shower again, so the next command should be go east.
