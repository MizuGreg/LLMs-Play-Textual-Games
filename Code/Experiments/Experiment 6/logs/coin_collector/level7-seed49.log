It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to try to take a trip east. If you can get around to doing that, try to move east. And then, make an effort to take a trip north. And then, attempt to go west. Once you accomplish that, take a trip west. Then, make an effort to take a trip south. Then, lift the coin from the floor of the kitchenette. And once you've done that, you win!
