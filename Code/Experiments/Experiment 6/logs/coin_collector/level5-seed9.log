I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! First of all, head south. With that accomplished, make an attempt to travel south. And then, attempt to go west. And then, move south. And then, retrieve the coin from the floor of the canteen. That's it!

You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user has been moving through different rooms in the TextWorld game. The goal mentioned earlier was to retrieve the coin from the canteen's floor. So far, they've gone from the sauna, spare room, basement, bedchamber, and now the canteen. In the canteen, there's a coin on the floor.

The user's last action was going south into the canteen. Now, the next step should be to pick up the coin. The prompt says to only output the action, like "take coin" or "get coin". Since the coin is on the floor, the correct command would be to take it. The user needs to retrieve the coin, which is the main objective here. So the next action is to take the coin from the floor.
</think>take coin
