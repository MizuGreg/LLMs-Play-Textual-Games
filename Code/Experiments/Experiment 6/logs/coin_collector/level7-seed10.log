Welcome to TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First step, try to venture east. Then, venture south. After that, try to go to the south. Once you succeed at that, try to go west. If you can finish that, try to move north. That done, make an effort to take a trip east. After that, retrieve the coin from the floor of the basement. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Steam Room =-
You arrive in a steam room. An usual one. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

-= Bedchamber =-
You arrive in a bedchamber. A normal one.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unblocked exit to the west.



>                                                                                                                                -= Bedchamber =-0/4
Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game and has been moving through different rooms. The goal is to eventually get the coin from the basement. So far, they've gone east from the spare room into the attic, then south to the steam room, then south again to the bedchamber. Now, in the bedchamber, the options are north or west.

The user is asking if they're making the right moves and if they're close to the goal. Let me think about the path. The original instructions said to go east, then south, then south again, then west, then north, then east again, and finally retrieve the coin from the basement. 

In the current bedchamber, the next steps according to the initial plan would be to go north or west. The user has already gone east, south, south, and now they're in the bedchamber. The next step in the plan was to go west. But the bedchamber's description says there's an unblocked exit to the west. So maybe going west is the right move here. 

But wait, the user is asking if they're close. The basement hasn't been reached yet. The coin is in the basement, so they need to navigate to the basement. The path so far hasn't included the basement. So maybe they need to continue exploring. 

Looking at the current room, the bedchamber, the options are north or west. If they go west, they might exit to another room. The initial plan after the bedchamber was to go west, then north, then east, then get the coin. But the user is now in the bedchamber, so the next step would be to go west. Let me check the previous steps again. 

Original steps: go east, south, south, west, north, east, then basement. So after the bedchamber, going west would take them to another room. Then from there, maybe north to reach the basement. But I need to make sure that the path is correct. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is on the right track. The current room is the bedchamber, and going west is the next step. So the next action should be "go west".

-= Chamber =-
You are in a chamber.



There is an unblocked exit to the east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.

-= Kitchenette =-
Well, here we are in a kitchenette.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

-= Basement =-
This might come as a shock to you, but you've just walked into a basement. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.



There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

There is a coin on the floor.


>                                                                                                                                -= Basement =-0/7
Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?

Okay, let's see. The user has reached the basement, which is where the coin is. The original goal was to retrieve the coin from the basement. So the next step is to pick up the coin. The current room is the basement, and there's a coin on the floor. The user needs to take the coin. The previous actions led them here, so the correct command now is to take the coin.

But wait, in text adventures, sometimes you have to use specific commands like "take coin" or "get coin". The user has been using "go" commands, so maybe they need to use "take" here. However, the user's previous interactions have only used "go" commands. But in the basement, the coin is on the floor, so the correct action is to take it. The user's last action was "go east" to get to the basement. Now, they need to pick up the coin. So the next command should be "take coin".
