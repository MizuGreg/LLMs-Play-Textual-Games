Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an life changing round of TextWorld? You do! First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to travel east. With that over with, venture east. And then, lift the coin from the floor of the pantry. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Shower =-
Well, here we are in a shower. You begin looking for stuff.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Cookery =-
You are in a cookery. A normal one.



There is an unguarded exit to the east. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing a text adventure game, and they've been given specific tasks. The initial instructions were to go east, then lift a coin in the pantry. So far, they went east from the shower into the cookery. Now, they're in the cookery, which has exits to east and west.

The user is asking if they're on the right track and if they're close to the goal. The next step would be to figure out where the pantry is. Since the first task was to lift the coin from the pantry, the player needs to find the pantry. The current location is the cookery. The exits are east and west. The user might need to go west back to the shower, but the initial direction was east. Wait, the first move was east from the shower, leading to the cookery. The pantry might be in the east exit of the cookery. But the user hasn't checked that yet. Alternatively, maybe the pantry is in the west direction. But the user is in the cookery, so they need to explore either exit. Since the original instruction was to go east first, maybe the pantry is east. But the user hasn't tried that yet. So the next action should be to go east from the cookery to check if that leads to the pantry. Alternatively, maybe the pantry is in the west, but the user is in the cookery, so they need to check both exits. However, the user's next move should be to proceed east, as per the initial direction. So the next command would be "go east".

-= Pantry =-
You find yourself in a pantry. A typical kind of place.



There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

There is a coin on the floor.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game where they need to find a coin in the pantry to win. So far, they've gone east from the shower, then east again into the cookery, and now they're in the pantry. The pantry has a coin on the floor, and the goal is to lift it.

The user's current location is the pantry. The next step would be to pick up the coin. The previous actions were moving east twice, which led them here. Since the coin is in the pantry, the correct action now is to pick it up. The game's goal is to lift the coin, so that's the next command. No need to move again unless the coin is in a different location, but according to the description, the coin is on the floor here. So the answer should be "lift coin".
</think>lift coin

That's not a verb I recognise.

Okay, the user tried to "lift coin" but the system said that's not a recognized verb. Let me think about the possible correct actions here. The user is in the Pantry, and there's a coin on the floor. The goal is to lift the coin to win.

In text adventures, common verbs are "take", "pick up", "get", etc. "Lift" might not be recognized because the game expects "take" or "get". So the correct command should be "take coin" or "get coin". Let me check the previous interactions. The user was told to "lift the coin from the floor of the pantry", but the game might use "take" instead. So the next action should be "take coin".
</think>take coin
