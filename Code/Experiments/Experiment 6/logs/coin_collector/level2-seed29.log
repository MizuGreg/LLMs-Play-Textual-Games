Welcome to TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First thing I need you to do is to go west. And then, recover the coin from the floor of the cellar. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Scullery =-
You arrive in a scullery. An ordinary one.



There is an unblocked exit to the west.

go west

-= Cellar =-
You arrive in a cellar. A typical one. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?



There is an unguarded exit to the east.

There is a coin on the floor.

That's not a verb I recognise.
