I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is how to play! First, it would be a great idea if you could head west. And then, attempt to travel north. Once you manage that, go north. And then, make an attempt to venture east. After that, take a trip north. Following that, take a trip west. After that, go to the west. And then, head west. And then, make an attempt to go to the west. After that, attempt to head west. Then, go west. Okay, and then, recover the coin from the floor of the chamber. That's it!
