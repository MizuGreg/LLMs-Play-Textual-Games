Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to make an attempt to move north. That done, try to travel east. And then, make an attempt to head north. Then, attempt to venture east. With that done, go south. And then, make an attempt to go to the west. That done, attempt to go to the west. After that, try to travel south. With that done, make an effort to go west. And then, go to the west. Once you accomplish that, recover the coin from the floor of the washroom. And if you do that, you're the winner!
