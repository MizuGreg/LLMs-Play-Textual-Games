You are now playing a exciting round of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, make an effort to venture south. With that done, go to the south. Once you do that, make an attempt to move west. And then, pick up the coin from the floor of the cellar. Alright, thanks!

You are in a cookery. A typical one.



You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.
