Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an life changing round of TextWorld? You do! Here is your task for today. Your first objective is to head south. With that accomplished, make an attempt to travel south. And then, attempt to go west. And then, move south. And then, attempt to head west. That done, retrieve the coin from the floor of the spare room. Got that? Good!

-= Canteen =-
You are in a canteen. An ordinary one.



You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game and has been given specific directions. Their first objective was to go south, then west, then south again, then west, and finally retrieve a coin from the spare room.

So far, they started in the canteen, went south to the dish-pit. The current location is the dish-pit. The next steps according to the initial instructions are to go west. But wait, the user's last action was going south, and now they're in the dish-pit. The prompt says to attempt to go west. But the user's next action is to go west from the dish-pit. However, the user is asking if they're making the right moves and if they're close to the goal. 

The dish-pit has an exit to the north and south. The user needs to go west next. But the current location is the dish-pit. So the next step is to go west. But the user is in the dish-pit, so maybe there's a west direction. The user's next action should be to go west. But the user is asking if they're on the right track. The answer is yes, because they followed the initial instructions: south, then west, then south, then west. So the next step is to go west from the dish-pit. But the user's next action is to go west. However, the user's last action was going south to the dish-pit, and now they need to go west. So the next command should be "go west". But the user is in the dish-pit, so maybe that's possible. The user's next action is to go west. Then, after that, they need to go south again. So the next step is to go west. The user's next action is "go west".

You can't go that way.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through a text-based game. Their goal is to reach a spare room and retrieve a coin. So far, they started in the canteen, went south to the dish-pit. Then they tried to go west, but couldn't. Now they're stuck in the dish-pit again.

The user is asking if they're on the right track and if they're close to the goal. The assistant needs to figure out the next move. Let's recap the environment. The dish-pit has exits to the north and south, both unguarded. The user tried to go west but couldn't. Maybe there's a different path. Since they can't go west from the dish-pit, perhaps they should try going south again. Wait, the original instructions said after going south once, go west, then south again, then west. But the first west didn't work. Maybe the user needs to try another direction. Alternatively, maybe there's a different route. But according to the current map, the dish-pit only has north and south exits. So the next logical step is to go south again. Let's check the previous steps. The user went south from canteen to dish-pit. Then tried west, which is blocked. So maybe the correct path is to go south again from dish-pit, then maybe west from there. But the user is stuck. The answer should be to go south again.

-= Basement =-
You are in a basement. A standard kind of place.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in a text-based game. Their goal is to reach the spare room and retrieve a coin. So far, they've gone south from the canteen to the dish-pit, then tried to go west but couldn't, so they went south again to the basement.

Now, in the basement, the提示 says to try going north or west. The user's next action should be based on the previous steps. Let me recap the path:

1. Canteen → South → Dish-Pit
2. Dish-Pit → South → Basement

In the basement, the directions mentioned are north and west. The original plan was to go south, then west, then south again, then west to get the coin. But in the dish-pit, going west was blocked. So maybe the path requires navigating through different areas.

Since the user is in the basement, the next step might be to go north back to the dish-pit or west. But the user's original plan after the basement would be to go west. However, the user needs to check if the path is possible. The basement's description says there's an unguarded exit to the west. So maybe going west from the basement is the next step. Alternatively, going north might lead back to the dish-pit, but the user might need to explore further.

But the user's goal is to get to the spare room and retrieve the coin. The path might require moving through the basement, then perhaps to another area. Since the user's previous steps were south, then west (but blocked), then south again, maybe the next step is to go west from the basement. Let me check the basement's description again: "You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west." So the basement has exits to north and west. The user's next action should be to go west, as per the instructions. So the answer is "go west".

-= Bedchamber =-
You are in a bedchamber. A normal one.



There is an unguarded exit to the east. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through these different rooms in the game. The original goal was to head south, then west, then south again, then west, and retrieve a coin from the spare room.

So far, the user started in the canteen, went south to the dish-pit, tried to go west but couldn't, so they went south again to the basement. Then they went west to the bedchamber. Now, the current room is the bedchamber, which has an exit to the east and south. 

The next step would be to follow the path that leads towards the spare room. The user needs to move in a way that eventually gets them to the spare room where the coin is. Since the bedchamber has a south exit, maybe that's the direction to go. But the user's previous actions were going west, then south, then west again. Wait, the original plan was after going west in the basement, then south again. But in the bedchamber, the exits are east and south. 

The user might need to go south from the bedchamber to proceed. Alternatively, maybe the east exit leads to a different path. But since the goal is to get to the spare room, which is likely a specific location, the user should continue moving south to reach the next room. The next action should be to go south from the bedchamber. Let me check the previous steps again. The user was in the bedchamber, and the next action is to go south. That would take them to the next room, perhaps the spare room or another area leading there. So the correct command here is "go south".

-= Sauna =-
You find yourself in a sauna. A standard kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the west.



>                                                                                                                                -= Sauna =-0/6

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in this text-based game. Their goal is to retrieve a coin from the spare room. So far, they've moved south from the canteen to the dish-pit, but couldn't go west, so they went south again to the basement. Then they went west to the bedchamber and south again to the sauna.

Now, in the sauna, the options are to go north or west. The user's next action was to go south, but that's not possible because the sauna's exits are north and west. Wait, the current room is the sauna, and the available exits are north and west. The user tried to go south, but that's not an option. So maybe they made a mistake there. But according to the last prompt, the user's next action was "go south" again, which isn't possible. But the game didn't respond with an error, so maybe the user is supposed to choose between north or west. The original plan was to go south, then west, then south again, then west to get the coin. But maybe the path requires moving through different rooms. Let me check the previous steps again.

The original task was: head south (done), then west (but in dish-pit, west wasn't possible, so they went south again). Then in basement, went west to bedchamber, then south to sauna. Now, in the sauna, the user needs to find the right path. The coin is in the spare room, so maybe the path involves moving through the sauna's exits. The user needs to go west from the sauna, which is unguarded. Then maybe proceed to the next room. The next step should be to go west from the sauna to reach the next room, which might be the spare room or another area leading to it. So the correct next action is "go west".

-= Spare Room =-
You find yourself in a spare room. A typical kind of place.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a coin on the floor.


>                                                                                                                                -= Spare Room =-0/7

Okay, let me figure out what to do next. The user's goal is to retrieve the coin from the floor of the spare room. They've already reached the spare room, and the coin is there. The current location is the Spare Room, and the coin is on the floor.

Looking at the previous steps, the user has been moving through different rooms: canteen, dish-pit, basement, bedchamber, sauna, and now the spare room. The next logical step is to pick up the coin. Since the coin is on the floor, the correct action would be to pick it up. The user hasn't done that yet, so the next command should be "take coin" or "get coin". 

The instructions mention that the user should only output the action, so I need to make sure it's the correct command. The environment indicates that the coin is on the floor, so picking it up is the next step. There's no mention of needing to move further, so the action is to take the coin.
