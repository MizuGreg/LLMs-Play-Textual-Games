I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. Your first objective is to make an effort to travel south. With that done, take a trip east. Once you finish that, make an attempt to go to the east. Okay, and then, pick up the coin from the floor of the cellar. Alright, thanks!

-= Dish-Pit =-
You've entered a dish-pit. You begin to take stock of what's here.



There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.
