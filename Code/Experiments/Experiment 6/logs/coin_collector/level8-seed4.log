You are in a shower. An ordinary kind of place. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game and has followed a series of directions to move through different rooms. The goal mentioned earlier was to pick up a coin from the canteen and then win. So far, they've gone from the shower to the cookery, pantry, parlor, and now the cookhouse.

Looking at the current room, the cookhouse, the提示 says there's an exit to the north and east. The user's previous action was going west from the parlor to the cookhouse. Now, the next step according to the initial instructions was to attempt to go north again. But the user is asking if they're on the right track and if they're close to the goal.

The original path mentioned going east, then north, west, north, north, then pick up the coin. So far, they've done east (shower to cookery), north (to pantry), west (to parlor), then north (to cookhouse). The next step in the original plan was to go north again from the cookhouse. But the cookhouse's exits are east and north. So going north from here would be the next step. Then, after reaching the next room, they would need to find the canteen, pick up the coin. But the current room is the cookhouse. The user might need to check if the canteen is in the next room north. Alternatively, maybe the coin is already in the cookhouse, but the instructions say to pick it up from the canteen. So perhaps the next step is to go north from the cookhouse, then proceed to the canteen. The user's next action should be to go north again. The assistant's previous response was "go north" from the pantry, then west from the parlor, so the next logical step is north from the cookhouse. The user is following the initial directions, so it's likely correct. Therefore, the next command should be "go north".

-= Cellar =-
