You are now playing a life changing session of TextWorld! Here is how to play! Your first objective is to try to take a trip east. If you can get around to doing that, try to move east. And then, make an effort to take a trip north. And then, attempt to go west. Once you accomplish that, take a trip west. Then, make an effort to take a trip south. Then, move south. Okay, and then, travel south. Okay, and then, lift the coin from the floor of the shower. That's it!
