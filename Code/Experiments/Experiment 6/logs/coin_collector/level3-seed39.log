It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. Your first objective is to head north. And then, make an attempt to go east. With that done, recover the coin from the floor of the kitchenette. Got that? Good!

-= Bedchamber =-
You're now in the bedchamber.



There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

>                                                                                                                                -= Bedchamber =-0/1
AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go north
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Closet =-
You arrive in a closet. An usual one. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go east
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Kitchenette =-
You are in a kitchenette. An ordinary kind of place. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.



There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

There is a coin on the floor.
