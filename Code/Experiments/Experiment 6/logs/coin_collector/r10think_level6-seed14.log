Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Workshop and Canteen. They keep going north and south, which is causing the repetition. The original goal was to retrieve the coin from the parlor, but so far, the user hasn't found it. The current location is the Workshop, which has an unblocked exit to the north and an unguarded exit to the west. The Canteen has an exit to the east and suggests going south.

Wait, the user's previous actions were moving north and south repeatedly, which is why they're stuck. The key is to find the correct path to the parlor where the coin is. The initial instructions mentioned venturing east, then north, then east again, and finally retrieving the coin. But the user hasn't reached the parlor yet.

Looking at the environment, the Workshop has a north exit to the Canteen and a west exit. The Canteen has an east exit back to the Workshop and a south exit. Maybe the user needs to go west from the Workshop to find another path. But the user kept going north, which loops back. So the correct action might be to go west from the Workshop to explore other areas, perhaps leading to the parlor. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east from the Canteen to the east exit, but that's unguarded. However, the original plan was to go east, then north, then east again. Maybe the user needs to go east from the Canteen, but the Canteen's east exit is unguarded. Wait, the user is in the Workshop, so maybe the west exit from the Workshop is the way to go. Let me check the previous steps.

The user started in the Office, went east to the Cellar, then east again to the Workshop. Then they kept moving north and south between Workshop and Canteen. The original plan was to go east, then north, then east again. But the user is stuck in a loop. So perhaps the correct path is to go west from the Workshop to find another exit that leads to the parlor. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east from the Canteen, but that's unguarded. Wait, the Canteen's east exit is unguarded, so maybe that's the way. But the user is in the Workshop, so going west from there. The Workshop's west exit is unguarded. So maybe the user should go west from the Workshop to explore that path. That would be the next action.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Office and Cellar, repeatedly going east and west. The original goal was to retrieve the coin from the parlor, but the user hasn't found it yet. The current path seems to be going in circles, which isn't effective. The user needs to find a different route that leads to the parlor. Maybe the correct path is to go north from the Workshop instead of south, but earlier attempts showed that going north from the Workshop leads back to the Canteen. Alternatively, perhaps the user needs to explore the west exit from the Cellar. But the user has been going west from the Cellar, which leads back to the Office. The key is to find a way to reach the parlor. Since the user hasn't found the coin yet, maybe they need to check other rooms. The next action should be to go north from the Cellar to escape the loop and find a new path.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Office and Cellar, repeatedly going east and west. The original goal was to retrieve the coin from the parlor, but the user hasn't found it yet. The current path seems to be going in circles, which isn't effective. The user needs to find a different route that leads to the parlor. Since the user hasn't found the coin yet, maybe they need to check other rooms. The next action should be to go north from the Cellar to escape the loop and find a new path.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Office and Cellar, repeatedly going east and west. The original goal was to retrieve the coin from the parlor, but the user hasn't found it yet. The current path seems to be going in circles, which isn't effective. The user needs to find a different route that leads to the parlor. Since the user hasn't found the coin yet, maybe they need to check other rooms. The next action should be to go north from the Cellar to escape the loop and find a new path.
