I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First stop, head north. And then, make an attempt to go east. With that done, go east. Next, move south. Then, attempt to travel west. Then, try to take a trip west. With that done, go north. After that, head north. Then, head east. Following that, make an attempt to go to the north. After that, head west. That done, make an attempt to go south. That done, go east. And then, pick up the coin from the floor of the bedchamber. Got that? Good!

-= Vault =-
You're now in the vault. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.
