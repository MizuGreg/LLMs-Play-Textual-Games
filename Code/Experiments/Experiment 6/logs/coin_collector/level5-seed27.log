Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. Your first objective is to make an effort to move north. And then, make an attempt to move west. After that, try to head west. And then, travel north. With that done, retrieve the coin from the floor of the studio. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Spare Room =-
Well, here we are in a spare room. You begin to take stock of what's here.



There is an unguarded exit to the north.

>                                                                                                                                -= Spare Room =-0/1
AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go north
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Canteen =-
You've entered a canteen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.



There is an unguarded exit to the south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.



>                                                                                                                                -= Canteen =-0/2
AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go west
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Attic =-
You've entered an attic. You can barely contain your excitement.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.



>                                                                                                                                -= Attic =-0/3
AGENT -------------------------------------------------

GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Kitchenette =-
You find yourself in a kitchenette. An usual one.



There is an unguarded exit to the east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north.



>                                                                                                                                -= Kitchenette =-0/4
AGENT -------------------------------------------------

-= Studio =-
Look at that sign! What does it say? It says Welcome to the studio? Well that's cool. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.



You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a coin on the floor.


>                                                                                                                                -= Studio =-0/5
