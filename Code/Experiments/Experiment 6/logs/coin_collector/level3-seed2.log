It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First of all, you could, like, try to venture north. After that, head east. That done, lift the coin from the floor of the bedchamber. That's it!

-= Spare Room =-
You are in a spare room. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.



There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. A normal one.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing a text adventure game called TextWorld. They started in the Spare Room, went north to the Kitchen. Now they're in the Kitchen, and the user is asking if they're making the right actions and if they're close to the goal.

First, I need to recall the previous steps. The initial instructions mentioned venturing north, then east, and lifting a coin from the bedchamber. The current location is the Kitchen. The user's next action should be based on the environment description.

In the Kitchen, the user can go east or south. The original goal was to lift the coin from the bedchamber. The bedchamber might be a different room. So, maybe the next step is to go east to explore further. The user has already gone north once, so going east from the Kitchen could lead to another room. The coin is in the bedchamber, so perhaps the path involves moving through different rooms. The user needs to follow the clues given in the initial instructions. The next logical step after the Kitchen is to go east, as the initial instructions suggested going east after starting. So the answer should be "go east".
</think>go east

-= Bedchamber =-
You arrive in a bedchamber. An ordinary kind of place.



You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a coin on the floor.

Okay, let me think through this. The user is in a text adventure game, moving through different rooms. The goal mentioned earlier was to lift the coin from the bedchamber's floor. So far, they've gone from the Spare Room to the Kitchen, then to the Bedchamber. In the Bedchamber, there's a coin on the floor.

The user's previous action was "go east", which led them to the Bedchamber. Now, the next step would be to pick up the coin. The instruction said to lift the coin from the floor of the bedchamber. So the correct action here is to pick up the coin. The available commands would be to interact with the coin, like taking it. Since the user is supposed to only output the action, the answer should be "take coin" or "lift coin". Checking the previous commands, the user used "go north", "go east", so following that pattern, the next command should be "take coin".
</think>take coin
