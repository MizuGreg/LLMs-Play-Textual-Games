You are now playing a life changing session of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First thing I need you to do is to make an attempt to travel north. If you can get through with that, go to the east. Then, go north. Following that, take a trip north. With that done, pick-up the coin from the floor of the shower. Alright, thanks!
