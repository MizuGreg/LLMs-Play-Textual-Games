It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First of all, you could, like, try to venture north. After that, head east. That done, go to the east. Next, lift the coin from the floor of the spare room. That's it!

-= Workshop =-
You've entered a workshop. The room is well lit.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north.

-= Kitchen =-
You've just shown up in a kitchen.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing a text-based game where they have to navigate through different rooms and complete tasks. The current scenario is in the Kitchen, and the user has to decide the next action.

First, I need to recall the previous steps. The user started in the Workshop, went north to the Kitchen. Now, the提示 says that in the Kitchen, they should try going east or south. The user is asking if they're making the right moves and if they're close to the goal.

The original instructions mentioned venturing north, then east, then east again, and lifting a coin in the spare room. But in the current context, the user is in the Kitchen. The goal might be to find the coin or reach an exit. The user's previous action was going north from the Workshop to the Kitchen. Now, the options are east or south.

The user is asking if they're on the right track. The assistant needs to decide the next command. Since the user is in the Kitchen, and the提示 suggests trying east or south, but the user is asking for advice. However, the user's instruction says to only output the action, so the assistant must choose between east or south.

Looking at the original path: after going north to the Kitchen, the next step was to go east. But the user is now in the Kitchen, and the prompt says "You should try going east. You don't like doors? Why not try going south..." So maybe the correct path is east. But the user is asking if they're close. The original goal was to lift the coin in the spare room. So maybe the path is to go east from the Kitchen to reach the spare room. Alternatively, maybe the coin is in the Kitchen, but the user hasn't found it yet.

But the user's previous action was going north, then the next step was east. So the user is following the original instructions. The next step would be to go east again. However, the current room is the Kitchen, and the user is being prompted to go east or south. The original plan was to go east, then east again, then lift the coin. So maybe the next step is east. But the user is in the Kitchen, and going east might lead to another room. Alternatively, the user might need to go south to find an exit. But the user is trying to reach the goal, which is the coin in the spare room.

So, based on the original instructions, the user should go east from the Kitchen. Therefore, the next action is "go east".

-= Bedchamber =-
You've entered a bedchamber.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.



>                                                                                                                                -= Bedchamber =-0/3

Okay, let's see. The user has been moving through different rooms: Workshop, Kitchen, now Bedchamber. The original instructions mentioned venturing north, then east, east again, and lifting a coin in the spare room. So far, the user went north from Workshop to Kitchen, then east to Bedchamber. The next step according to the initial instructions was to go east again, but in the Bedchamber, the options are east or west.

Wait, the user's current location is Bedchamber. The prompt says "You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked." So the options are east or west. The original plan was to go east twice from the Workshop and Kitchen. But maybe the path requires moving west? Or perhaps the user needs to check the coin in the spare room. But the spare room wasn't mentioned yet.

Wait, the initial instructions said: "After that, head east. That done, go to the east. Next, lift the coin from the floor of the spare room." So maybe after entering the Bedchamber, the next step is to go east again, but the Bedchamber's east might lead to another room. Alternatively, maybe the spare room is a different location. But the user hasn't found the coin yet. So perhaps the correct path is to continue east, but the current Bedchamber's east is unguarded. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west to find the coin. But the initial plan was to go east twice. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go east from the Kitchen to the Bedchamber, then east again to reach the spare room. But the Bedchamber's east is unguarded. So the next action should be east again. The user's previous actions were go north, go east, go east. But in the Bedchamber, the options are east or west. So the next step is to go east again. The user's next action should be east. But the user's last action was go east to Bedchamber. So the next step is to go east again. The answer should be "go east".

-= Spare Room =-
You are in a spare room. It seems to be pretty normal here.



There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

There is a coin on the floor.

Okay, let's see. The user has been navigating through different rooms in the TextWorld game. The original instructions mentioned lifting the coin from the floor of the spare room. The current room is the Spare Room, which has a coin on the floor. The user's previous actions were going north, east, and then east again, leading them to the Spare Room.

The next step according to the instructions was to lift the coin. The user hasn't done that yet. The current room's description mentions the coin is on the floor, so the correct action here would be to pick it up. The user's next move should be to take the coin. The response should only include the command, so "take coin" or "lift coin" would be appropriate. Since the game uses "lift" in the initial instructions, maybe "lift coin" is the exact term needed here. I need to make sure to use the correct verb. The game's previous messages used "lift the coin", so the correct command is "lift coin".

That's not a verb I recognise.

Okay, the user tried to "lift coin" but the system said that's not a recognized verb. Let me check the available actions here. The current room is the Spare Room, which has an exit to the west and a coin on the floor. The previous actions were moving north, east, east, which led here. The goal was to lift the coin from the floor of the spare room.

Since "lift coin" isn't a valid command, maybe the correct verb is "take" or "pick up". In text adventures, "take" is commonly used for picking up items. So the user probably meant to take the coin. The system might not recognize "lift" as a valid verb, so the correct command should be "take coin". Let me confirm if "take" is the right verb here. Yes, "take" is standard. So the next action should be "take coin".
