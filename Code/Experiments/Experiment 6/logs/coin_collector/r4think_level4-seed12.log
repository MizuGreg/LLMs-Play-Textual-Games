Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First, it would be great if you could go to the west. Then, make an attempt to move west. Next, venture west. And then, recover the coin from the floor of the workshop. Got that? Good!

-= Vault =-
You arrive in a vault. A typical one. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."



There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

go west

-= Cookhouse =-
You're now in a cookhouse.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

go west

-= Closet =-
You are in a closet. A standard one. The room is well lit.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.



>                                                                                                                                -= Closet =-0/3
Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me figure out what to do next. The user is in a closet, and there are exits to both east and west. The original goal was to recover the coin from the workshop. So far, they've gone west from the vault into the cookhouse, then west again into the closet. The coin is in the workshop, which is probably further west since the first exit was west from the vault.

Wait, the vault's west exit led to the cookhouse, then west from there to the closet. Maybe the workshop is beyond the closet's west exit? But the closet has exits to east and west. If the user keeps going west, maybe they'll find the workshop. But the coin is on the floor of the workshop, so they need to check there. However, the current room is the closet. The next step would be to go west again from the closet to reach the workshop. Alternatively, maybe the coin is in the closet, but the user hasn't checked yet. But the original instruction said the coin is in the workshop. So the user needs to proceed west from the closet to get to the workshop, then pick up the coin. So the next action should be go west.

-= Workshop =-
Welcome to the workshop. Let's see what's in here.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

There is a coin on the floor.
