Welcome to another life changing episode of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First of all, go to the west. Then, make an attempt to move west. Next, venture west. And then, venture north. If you can finish that, lift the coin from the floor of the study. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Vault =-
Well, here we are in a vault.



You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.
