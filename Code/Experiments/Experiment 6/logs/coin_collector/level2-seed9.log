It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is how to play! Your first objective is to head south. With that accomplished, pick up the coin from the floor of the bedchamber. And once you"ve done that, you win!

-= Basement =-
You are in a basement. It seems to be pretty normal here. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.



You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Bedchamber =-
A crooked placard tells you that you are now in the bedchamber.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north.

There is a coin on the floor.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing a text adventure game. The goal is to head south first, then pick up the coin in the bedchamber, and then win. 

So far, they started in the basement, went south into the bedchamber. Now, in the bedchamber, there's a coin on the floor. The next step should be to pick up the coin. But the user is asking if they're making the right moves and if they're close to winning.

The current room is the bedchamber. The user needs to pick up the coin. The previous action was going south, which was correct. Now, the coin is in the bedchamber. The next logical step is to pick up the coin. The user should say "take coin" or "pick up coin". But in text adventures, sometimes the command is "get coin" or "take coin". The game's previous commands used "go south", so maybe "take coin" is the right command here.

Wait, the user's last action was going south, which led them to the bedchamber. Now, the coin is on the floor. The next action should be to pick up the coin. The user is asking if they're close to the goal. Since they've already gone south and the coin is there, picking it up should be the next step. Then, after picking it up, they win. So the next command should be "take coin" or "get coin". The correct command here is probably "take coin".
