I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! First step, venture north. And then, travel north. And then, recover the coin from the floor of the chamber. Alright, thanks!

Well, here we are in a studio.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north.

You have come into a workshop. Not the workshop you'd expect. No, this is a workshop.



There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they've been moving between rooms. The goal seems to be recovering the coin from the chamber. So far, they've gone north twice, then south twice, ending up back in the workshop. The coin is in the chamber, which is accessible from the workshop.

The user is asking if they're making the right actions and if they're close to the goal. The current location is the workshop again. The next step would be to go north again to reach the chamber where the coin is. Since the workshop has an exit to the north that's unblocked, moving north once more should take them back to the chamber. Then they can pick up the coin. So the correct next action is to go north.
