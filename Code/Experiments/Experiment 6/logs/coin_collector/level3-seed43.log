Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an profound round of TextWorld? You do! Here is your task for today. First of all, you could, like, make an attempt to travel north. If you can get through with that, go to the east. Then, recover the coin from the floor of the study. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Playroom =-
You are in a playroom. An usual one. You begin to take stock of what's here.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Workshop =-
You find yourself in a workshop. A standard one.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unblocked exit to the south.
