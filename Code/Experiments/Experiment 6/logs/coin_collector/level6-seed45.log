I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First thing I need you to do is to make an attempt to venture south. If you can manage that, take a trip east. Then, make an effort to go east. With that done, make an effort to venture north. Next, head west. And then, recover the coin from the floor of the kitchen. Got that? Good!

-= Kitchenette =-
Well, here we are in a kitchenette.



There is an unguarded exit to the south.
