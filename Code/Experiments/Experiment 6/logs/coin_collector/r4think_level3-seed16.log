Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First stop, make an attempt to venture west. With that done, head south. And then, pick-up the coin from the floor of the cubicle. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Steam Room =-
You have walked into a steam room. Not the steam room you'd expect. No, this is a steam room.



There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

-= Studio =-
A crooked sign tells you that you are now in the studio. You begin to take stock of what's here.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Cubicle =-
Look at that placard! What does it say? It says Welcome to the cubicle? Well that's cool.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked.

There is a coin on the floor.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me figure out what to do next. The user is in the Cubicle room. The goal was to pick up the coin from the floor of the cubicle after venturing west, then south, and now here.

The current room is the Cubicle. The placard says "Welcome to the cubicle?" and there's a coin on the floor. The user needs to pick up the coin. But the prompt says to first make an attempt to venture west, then south, then pick up the coin. Wait, the user already did west and south. Now they're in the Cubicle. The next step is to pick up the coin. But the game might require interacting with the coin. However, the user's previous actions were movement commands. The coin is on the floor, so maybe the correct action is to pick it up. But in TextWorld, sometimes you have to use "take" or "get" commands. But the user's previous actions were "go west" and "go south". The next step is to pick up the coin. But the user's instruction says to pick up the coin from the floor of the cubicle. So the correct command here would be "take coin" or "get coin". However, the user's previous commands were movement commands. But the game might require using the "take" command. Let me check the previous messages. The user was told to "pick-up the coin from the floor of the cubicle. And once you've done that, you win!" So the next action should be to pick up the coin. But in the current room, the coin is on the floor. So the correct command is "take coin" or "get coin". However, in some TextWorld implementations, you might just need to pick it up by interacting with it. But the user's previous actions were movement, so maybe the next step is to pick up the coin. The user's last message was in the Cubicle room, with the coin on the floor. So the next action should be to pick up the coin. Therefore, the correct command is "take coin".
