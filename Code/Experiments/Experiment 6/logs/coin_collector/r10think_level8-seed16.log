Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is in a text-based game where they have to navigate through different rooms and eventually retrieve a coin from the office. The current room is the Kitchenette, and the exits mentioned are east and west. The user has been moving back and forth between the Kitchenette and the Cubicle multiple times.

The original instructions were to venture west, then south, east, east again, north, west, and then get the coin. But the user is stuck in a loop between the Kitchenette and Cubicle. The exits are always east and west, but the game seems to be resetting or not progressing as expected.

Wait, the user's goal is to retrieve the coin from the office. So maybe the coin is in a different room that's not being visited yet. The current path seems to be going in circles. The user might need to find a way to get out of this loop and proceed to the office. But the game's feedback is always suggesting to go east or west, which are the same rooms. 

Alternatively, maybe the coin is in the Kitchenette, but the user hasn't looked closely. The game mentions "looking" in the Kitchenette, so perhaps the coin is there. But the user hasn't checked the floor yet. The original instruction said to retrieve the coin from the floor of the office, so maybe the office is a different room. 

But the user hasn't reached the office yet. The path seems to be stuck between Kitchenette and Cubicle. Maybe the user needs to find another exit or look for clues. However, the game's responses are limited to the exits mentioned. The user might need to try moving east again, but that leads back to the Kitchenette. Alternatively, maybe the office is in a different direction, but the game isn't showing it. 

Since the user is repeatedly being told to go east or west, and the current room is Kitchenette, the next logical step is to go east again, but that's what the user has been doing. However, the user might need to check the floor for the coin. The game says "retrieve the coin from the floor of the office," so maybe the office is the next room. But the user hasn't gotten there yet. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go north from the Kitchenette, but the game says to go west. Wait, in the Kitchenette description, it says "You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west." So the user is supposed to go west, which leads back to the Cubicle. But the user is stuck in a loop. 

Perhaps the coin is in the Cubicle or Kitchenette. The user needs to check the floor. But the game hasn't mentioned the coin yet. The original goal was to retrieve the coin from the office, so maybe the office is a different room. The user needs to find the office. 

But the current path isn't leading to the office. The user might need to find another way. However, the game's feedback is limited. The user might need to keep moving east and west until they find the office. Alternatively, maybe the office is in the south direction, but the user hasn't checked that. 

Wait, in the Studio room, there was an exit to the south. The user went south from the Studio to the Dish-Pit, then east to Cubicle, then west to Kitchenette. Maybe the office is in a different part. The user needs to keep moving until they reach the office. 

But the user is stuck in a loop between Kitchenette and Cubicle. The next step is to go east again, but that's what's been happening. Maybe the user needs to try going north from the Kitchenette, but the game says to go west. 

Alternatively, maybe the user should look for the coin in the current room. The game says to retrieve the coin from the floor of the office, so the user needs to reach the office. The user hasn't reached the office yet. The path seems to be going in circles. 

Given the instructions, the user should continue moving east and west until they reach the office. But the game's feedback is not showing that. Maybe the user needs to keep going east, but the game is not allowing that. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go north from the Kitchenette, but the game says to go west. The user might need to follow the game's suggestions and keep moving west and east. 

In the end, the user's next action should be to go east again, as per the game's instruction, even though it's leading back and forth. The user needs to keep moving until they reach the office.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me recap the user's journey so far. They started in the Steam Room, then moved west to the Studio, south to the Dish-Pit, east to the Cubicle, and back and forth between Kitchenette and Cubicle multiple times. Then they ended up in the Pantry, Canteen, Office, and back again.

The original goal was to retrieve the coin from the floor of the office. The user finally reached the Office room where the coin is located. The last action was going east from the Office, which led them back to the Canteen. Now, they're in the Canteen again, and the next step is to go south to return to the Pantry, then north to the Office again. But the coin is already on the floor of the Office, so maybe the user needs to pick it up once they're in the Office.

Wait, in the Office room, the game mentioned there's a coin on the floor. The user was in the Office, but when they went east, they left the Office and went back to the Canteen. Now, they need to go back to the Office again to retrieve the coin. The current room is the Canteen, so the next step should be to go north to the Pantry, then north again to the Office. But the user is at the Canteen, so the immediate next action is to go south to return to the Pantry. Wait, no, the Canteen has an exit to the south (which is the Pantry) and west (which is the Office? Or another room?).

Wait, in the Canteen room, the exits are south (Pantry) and west (maybe the Office?). Wait, no, when the user was in the Office, they went east to the Canteen. So the Office's east exit is the Canteen. Therefore, the Canteen's west exit is the Office. So from the Canteen, going west would lead back to the Office, where the coin is. So the user is in the Canteen, and the next action should be to go west to the Office again, then pick up the coin. But the user hasn't picked it up yet. The game's last message was in the Canteen, and the user needs to go west to the Office to retrieve the coin. However, the user's last action was going south from the Pantry to the Canteen. Now, in the Canteen, the correct next step is to go west to the Office to get the coin. But the user might have already been there. Wait, the user was in the Office, then went east to Canteen, then south to Pantry, then north to Canteen again. So now, from the Canteen, going west would take them back to the Office where the coin is. So the next action should be go west to the Office, then pick up the coin. But the user hasn't done that yet. The game's current room is the Canteen, so the next command is go west to the Office. But the user's last action was go south, leading to the Canteen. So the next step is to go west from Canteen to Office, then pick up the coin. However, the user might need to explicitly pick it up, but the game might require being in the Office room. So the correct next action is go west to the Office, then pick up the coin. But the user's last action was in the Canteen, so the next command is go west.
