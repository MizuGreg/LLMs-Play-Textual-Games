Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, you could, like, make an attempt to head east. Following that, make an attempt to venture south. Then, make an effort to take a trip south. And then, make an effort to travel south. If you can manage that, attempt to go east. Then, go to the south. Following that, attempt to take a trip west. And then, attempt to venture south. Next, pick up the coin from the floor of the studio. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text adventure game, and they've been moving through different rooms: pantry, bar, cookery, recreation zone, kitchen, and now the salon. The original goal was to go east, then south three times, then east, south, west, south, pick up the coin, and stop. So far, they've followed the initial steps: went east from pantry, south to bar, south to cookery, south to recreation zone, east to kitchen, then east again to salon. Now they're in the salon.

The current room is the salon. The prompt says there's an unguarded exit to the west. The user's next action should be to go west, as per the previous pattern. But wait, the original plan after reaching the salon would be to go south again. Wait, let me check the original instructions again. The user was told to: go east, then south three times, then east, south, west, south, pick up the coin. So after the initial east, three souths, then east, south, west, south. So after the salon, the next step would be to go west (as per the instruction), then south. But in the salon, the exits are south and west. So the user needs to go west first, then south. But the user's next action is to go west. But the user's last action was going east to the salon. So the next step is to go west. Then, after that, go south. Then pick up the coin. But the user is in the salon now, and the next action is to go west. So the correct command here is "go west".
