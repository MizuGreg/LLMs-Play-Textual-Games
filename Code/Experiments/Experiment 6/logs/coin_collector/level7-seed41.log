Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. Your first objective is to try to take a trip south. Okay, and then, take a trip west. That done, make an effort to head south. And then, try to go west. Once you finish that, venture south. Okay, and then, go to the east. Then, pick up the coin from the floor of the basement. That's it!
