You are now playing a fast paced episode of TextWorld! First thing I need you to do is to make an effort to move south. And then, take a trip east. Then, pick-up the coin from the floor of the studio. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Cookhouse =-
You've entered a cookhouse. The room is well lit.



There is an unblocked exit to the south.

GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Spare Room =-
I am required to announce that you are now in the spare room.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.



>                                                                                                                                -= Spare Room =-0/2
Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing a text adventure game. The goal is to move south, then east, pick up the coin, and win. So far, they've moved south from the Cookhouse to the Spare Room. The current room is the Spare Room, and the user is asked to decide whether they're on the right track.

In the Spare Room, the hints say to try going east or north. The user needs to follow the path to get the coin. The original plan was to go south first, then east. But after moving south, the next step was supposed to be east. However, in the Spare Room, the available directions are north and east. Wait, the user was told to take a trip east after moving south. So maybe from the Spare Room, going east is the next step. But the user hasn't done that yet. The user is now in the Spare Room, and the next action should be to go east. But the user is asking if they're on the right track. The user's previous action was going south, which was correct. Now, in the Spare Room, they need to go east. The next step is to go east. Then, after that, they need to pick up the coin. So the next action should be "go east".
</think>go east

-= Studio =-
You've just walked into a studio.



There is an unblocked exit to the west.

There is a coin on the floor.


>                                                                                                                                -= Studio =-0/3
Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user has been moving through different rooms in the game. The original goal was to move south, then east, pick up the coin, and win. So far, they went south to the Spare Room, then east to the Studio. In the Studio, there's a coin on the floor.

The next step according to the original plan was to pick up the coin. The user is now in the Studio, and the coin is there. So the next action should be to pick up the coin. The command for that would be "take coin" or "pick up coin". Since the game's previous commands used "go" for movement, maybe "take" is the right verb here. But I need to check the game's possible commands. However, the user's instructions say to only output the action, like "go north". So the correct command here is "take coin" or "pick up coin". But in TextWorld, the correct command is usually "take" followed by the item. So the answer should be "take coin".
</think>take coin
