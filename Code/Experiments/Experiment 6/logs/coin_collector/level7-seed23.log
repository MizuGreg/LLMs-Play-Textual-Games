I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is how to play! First of all, make an effort to travel south. With that done, take a trip east. Once you finish that, make an attempt to go to the east. Okay, and then, travel east. Then, go south. Then, make an attempt to go to the east. With that accomplished, lift the coin from the floor of the sauna. Once that's all handled, you can stop!
