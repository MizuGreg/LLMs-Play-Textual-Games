It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Your first objective is to make an effort to venture south. With that done, retrieve the coin from the floor of the cellar. Alright, thanks!

-= Laundry Place =-
You find yourself in a laundry place. An usual one.



There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

-= Cellar =-
Guess what, you are in a place we're calling a cellar. You begin to take stock of what's here.



There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

There is a coin on the floor.
