Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First, it would be fantastic if you could make an effort to take a trip west. Next, retrieve the coin from the floor of the spare room. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Dish-Pit =-
You arrive in a dish-pit. An ordinary one.



There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

>                                                                                                                                -= Dish-Pit =-0/1
AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go west

-= Spare Room =-
You are in a spare room. An ordinary kind of place.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east.

There is a coin on the floor.
