Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! First, it would be good if you could head south. With that accomplished, make an attempt to travel south. And then, attempt to go west. And then, move south. And then, attempt to head west. That done, make an effort to head south. And then, go to the south. Then, take a trip south. Then, make an effort to go to the west. After that, go to the west. Then, pick up the coin from the floor of the garage. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

You have fallen into the most typical of all possible studios. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?



There is an unblocked exit to the south.

Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text adventure game called TextWorld. They've been moving through different rooms: first the Studio, then the Attic, and now the Basement. The goal mentioned earlier was to pick up a coin from the garage and then stop. 

Looking at the current room, the Basement has an unguarded exit to the north and a west exit. The user's previous actions were moving south repeatedly, which made sense since the first room had an exit to the south. Now, in the Basement, the exits are north and west. The user's next step would logically be to check the west direction since the north exit is already unguarded and might lead back.

But wait, the original goal was to get to the garage to pick up the coin. So maybe the basement is part of the path towards the garage. However, the user hasn't found any coins yet. The user might need to explore further. Since the west exit is available, moving west could lead to another room where the coin is located. Alternatively, maybe the north exit leads back to the attic, which might have more clues.

But the user's instructions said to move south again, then west, then south, etc. Following the initial directions, after the basement, the next step would be to go west. The user might be following a specific path to reach the garage. So the next action should be to go west. That makes sense because the user's previous steps were moving south, and now in the basement, moving west could be the next logical step in the sequence. The user needs to continue exploring until they find the coin in the garage.

-= Bedchamber =-
You've entered a bedchamber.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Bedchamber now. The previous rooms were Studio → Attic → Basement → Bedchamber. The goal is to pick up the coin from the garage. The current room's exits are east and south. The user's previous actions followed a pattern of moving south, then west, then south again. But in the Bedchamber, the available exits are east and south. The user needs to figure out the correct path to the garage.

The user's last action was going west from the basement to the bedchamber. Now, in the bedchamber, the options are east or south. The original plan was to move south again. But the room says "You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. There is an unblocked exit to the south." So both east and south are unblocked. But the user's previous steps were moving south, so maybe continuing south is the right move. However, the room's message suggests trying east. But the user's goal is the garage. Maybe the garage is in a different direction. Alternatively, maybe the bedchamber is part of the path leading to the garage. The user needs to check which direction leads closer. Since the user's initial instructions were to move south, then west, then south, then west again, perhaps the next step is to go south again. But the room says there's an exit to the south. So the user should go south. Alternatively, maybe the east exit leads to the garage. But without more info, the user should follow the initial path. The next action would be to go south.

-= Sauna =-
You've entered a sauna. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the west.



>                                                                                                                                -= Sauna =-0/5

Okay, let's recap the user's journey so far. They started in the Studio, went south to the Attic, then south again to the Basement, west to the Bedchamber, south to the Sauna, and then north back to the Bedchamber. The goal is to pick up a coin from the garage.

Looking at the current room, the Bedchamber, the exits are east and south. The user has been moving between these rooms, but haven't found the garage yet. The Sauna was a recent stop, but no coin there. Maybe the garage is in a different direction. The user's previous steps involved moving south and west, but now they're back in the Bedchamber. The next logical step might be to try the east exit, as the room suggests trying east. Alternatively, since the user's initial plan was to move south, maybe that's still the way to go. But the Bedchamber's south exit leads back to the Sauna, which doesn't seem helpful. The east exit might lead to another area. The user needs to explore east to find the garage. So the next action should be to go east.

Okay, let's see. The user has been moving around different rooms in the game. They started in the Studio, then went through the Attic, Basement, Bedchamber, Sauna, and back to the Bedchamber. The goal is to pick up a coin from the garage.

Currently, they're in the Bedchamber again, with exits to east and south. The previous steps have them cycling between the Bedchamber and Basement. The user needs to find the garage where the coin is. So far, they haven't found it. Maybe the garage is in a different direction. The Sauna was a previous room, but no coin there. The user might need to check other exits. The Bedchamber's east exit was tried before, leading to the Sauna. Maybe the south exit leads to another room. But the user has already been there. Alternatively, maybe the garage is in the Basement. Wait, the Basement has an exit to the west. But the user is currently in the Bedchamber. Maybe they need to go east again. But the user's last action was going west, which brought them back to the Bedchamber. The next step should be to try the east exit again, as the room suggests. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go south from the Bedchamber. But the south exit leads to the Sauna, which doesn't seem helpful. The user needs to find the garage, so perhaps the correct path is to keep moving east from the Bedchamber. Let's try that.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Bedchamber and Basement. They've tried moving east, west, north, and south multiple times without finding the garage. The goal is to pick up the coin from the garage. So far, they haven't encountered the garage yet. The current room is the Bedchamber, with exits to east and south. The user needs to keep exploring until they find the garage. The next step should be to try going east again, as the room suggests. Alternatively, maybe the south exit leads to another room. But the user has been there before. The correct path might be to keep moving east from the Bedchamber.
