Okay, let's see. The user is playing a text-based game and has followed a set of instructions to move through different locations. The goal is to lift a coin from the garage floor. So far, they've moved east from the office to the cellar, then east again to the workshop, then north to the canteen. Now, they're in the canteen, which is location 4 out of 5 steps.

The next step according to the original instructions was to travel east again. But in the canteen, the exits are east and south. The user's next action should be to go east. However, the user is asking if they're on the right track and if they're close to the goal. 

Wait, the original plan was: venture east, then east again, then north, then east, then north, then west, south, west. But in the current location (canteen), the next step according to the sequence is to go north. Wait, no. Let me check again.

Original instructions: After entering the office, go east (to cellar), then east again (to workshop), then north (to canteen). Then the next step was to travel east. But in the canteen, the east exit is unblocked. So maybe the next step is to go east from the canteen. But the user is asking if they're close. 

But the original plan after the canteen would be to go north again? Wait, the original steps were: after the canteen, the next step was to take a trip north. Wait, the original instructions said: "First thing I need you to do is to venture east. Then, make an attempt to travel east. With that over with, make an attempt to venture north. Then, travel east. Following that, take a trip north. Following that, make an attempt to take a trip west. With that accomplished, venture south. Then, go west. If you can succeed at that, lift the coin from the floor of the garage."

So the sequence is: east, east, north, east, north, west, south, west. So after the canteen (which is after the third step: east, east, north), the next step is to travel east again. So from the canteen, go east. Then, after that, take a trip north. Then west, south, west. 

But in the canteen, the user is at location 4. The next step is to go east. So the next action should be "go east". But the user is asking if they're making the right moves. So the answer is yes, they are on the right track. The next action is to go east from the canteen. Then, after that, they'll go north, etc. So the next command is "go east".

Okay, let's break down the user's current situation. They've been moving through different rooms in the game following a specific sequence: east, east, north, east, north, west, south, west. Now they're in the Bedroom again, having come from the Laundromat. The next step in their original plan was to go west from the Laundromat, which they did, leading them back to the Bedroom. Now, they're at Bedroom 9, and the next step according to the original instructions was to venture south. But in the Bedroom, the exit to the south is unblocked, so they should go south. However, the user is asking if they're on the right track and close to the goal. 

Looking at the sequence, after the Bedroom (step 9), the next step should be to go south. Then, from the Bedroom, going south would take them to the next room, which might be the Garage where the coin is. But the user is now in the Bedroom, and the next action should be to go south. However, the previous step was going north from the Laundromat to the Bedroom. So the next step is to go south from the Bedroom. But the user is asking if they're close. Since the original goal is to reach the garage, and the sequence seems to be looping, maybe they need to check if the next move is correct. The user's next action should be to go south from the Bedroom. But the user is asking if they're close, so the answer is yes, they're on the right path. The next command is "go south".

Okay, let's see. The user is in a loop between the Laundromat and the Bedroom. They've been going back and forth between these two rooms. The original goal was to lift the coin from the garage floor. So far, the user has followed the steps: east, east, north, east, north, west, south, west. But now they're stuck in a loop between Laundromat and Bedroom.

Looking at the current situation, the user is in the Bedroom (step 13). The next step according to the original plan was to go south, but that leads back to the Laundromat. The user needs to find a way to get to the garage. Maybe the sequence is supposed to lead them through different rooms until they reach the garage. However, the current path isn't progressing towards the garage. The user might be missing a different path or there's a mistake in the sequence.

Alternatively, maybe the garage is in a different direction. The user needs to check if there's another exit in the Bedroom that wasn't mentioned. The Bedroom has an unguarded exit to the east and a south exit. The user has been going south, which brings them back to the Laundromat. Maybe they need to go east from the Bedroom instead. But the original plan said to go south after the Bedroom. However, if going south isn't working, perhaps the user needs to try a different direction.

Wait, the original instructions said after the canteen, go east to the Chamber, then north to the Parlor, west to the Bedroom, south to the Laundromat, then north again to the Bedroom. It seems like the user is stuck in a loop between Laundromat and Bedroom. Maybe the correct path is to go east from the Bedroom instead of south. But according to the original plan, after the Bedroom (step 9), the next step was to go south. However, that leads back to the Laundromat. Maybe the user needs to find another way out of the Bedroom. The Bedroom has an exit to the east, which is unguarded. Maybe that's the way to go. But the original plan didn't mention that. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to proceed further east from the Laundromat. But the Laundromat has an exit to the north and west. The user has been going north again, which brings them back to the Bedroom. 

It's possible that the user is not following the correct sequence. The original goal was to reach the garage, but the current path isn't leading there. The user might need to check if there's another exit in the Laundromat or Bedroom that wasn't considered. Alternatively, maybe the garage is in a different part of the map, and the user needs to explore other directions. However, based on the given information, the user is stuck in a loop. The next action should be to go east from the Bedroom, even though the original plan said to go south. But since going south isn't working, maybe that's the right move. Alternatively, the user might need to go east from the Laundromat. But the Laundromat's exit to the north is unguarded, so going north again would loop back. 

In this case, the user is at Bedroom 13. The next step should be to go east, as that's the unguarded exit. But according to the original plan, they should go south. However, since the user is stuck in a loop, maybe they need to try a different direction. The answer here is to go east from the Bedroom, even though the original plan said south. But the user is asking if they're close to the goal. Since they're looping, maybe they're not on the right path. But the original plan might have a mistake. Alternatively, the garage is in the Laundromat, and the user needs to check there. But the Laundromat's description doesn't mention a coin. The original goal is to lift the coin from the garage floor, so the user needs to reach the garage. 

Given the current situation, the user is in the Bedroom. The next action should be to go east, as that's the unguarded exit. So the answer is "go east".

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Laundromat and the Bedroom. They've been going back and forth between these two rooms repeatedly. The original goal was to lift the coin from the garage floor, but the current path isn't leading them there. The user is asking if they're on the right track and if they're close to the goal.

Looking at the sequence of moves, the user has followed the initial instructions but ended up in a loop. The key issue is that the path they're taking isn't progressing towards the garage. The Bedroom and Laundromat are part of a cycle, and the user needs to find another way out. 

The original plan mentioned moving east, north, west, south, etc., but perhaps the correct path requires exploring other directions. In the Bedroom, there's an unguarded exit to the east, which the user hasn't tried yet. Going east from the Bedroom might lead to a different room that's part of the path to the garage. Alternatively, the Laundromat might have an exit that wasn't considered, like the west exit. However, the user has been going north from the Laundromat, which brings them back to the Bedroom.

Since the user is asking if they're close, it's possible they're not on the right path. The next action should be to try a different direction, such as going east from the Bedroom, even though the original plan said to go south. This might break the loop and lead them to a new area. The answer is to go east from the Bedroom.

Okay, the user is clearly stuck in a loop between the Laundromat and the Bedroom. They've been going back and forth between these two rooms repeatedly, which suggests that the current path isn't leading them toward the garage where the coin is. The original instructions mentioned a specific sequence of moves, but it seems like the user is following a different path that's causing them to loop.

The key here is to determine if there's another way out of the Laundromat or the Bedroom that wasn't mentioned. The Laundromat has an unguarded exit to the north and a west exit. The Bedroom has an unguarded exit to the east and a south exit. The user has been going south from the Bedroom to the Laundromat and then north back to the Bedroom, creating a cycle.

Since the user is asking if they're close to the goal, it's possible that they're not on the right path. The original plan might have required moving east from the Laundromat instead of north. However, the Laundromat's description mentions an unguarded exit to the north, which the user has been using. Alternatively, the west exit from the Laundromat might lead to a different area.

But given the current situation, the next logical step would be to try the west exit from the Laundromat. That's the unblocked exit mentioned, and it might lead to a different room that's part of the path to the garage. So the next action should be to go west from the Laundromat.

I am sorry to announce that you are now in the garage. Let's see what's in here.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a coin on the floor.
