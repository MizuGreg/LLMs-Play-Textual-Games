Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is how to play! First, it would be fantastic if you could make an attempt to move north. That done, try to travel east. And then, make an attempt to head north. Then, attempt to venture east. With that done, go south. And then, recover the coin from the floor of the office. Alright, thanks!
