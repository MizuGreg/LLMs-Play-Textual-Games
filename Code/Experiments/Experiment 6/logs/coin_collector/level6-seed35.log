Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an life changing round of TextWorld? You do! First of all, you could, like, make an effort to venture south. With that done, go to the south. Once you do that, make an attempt to move west. And then, travel south. And then, try to head south. Once you succeed at that, pick-up the coin from the floor of the restroom. Alright, thanks!

-= Cookery =-
I never took you for the sort of person who would show up in a cookery, but I guess I was wrong.



There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.
