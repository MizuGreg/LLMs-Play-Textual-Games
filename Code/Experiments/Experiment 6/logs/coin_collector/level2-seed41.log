I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is how to play! Your first objective is to try to take a trip south. Okay, and then, retrieve the coin from the floor of the kitchenette. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Scullery =-
You've entered a scullery.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.
