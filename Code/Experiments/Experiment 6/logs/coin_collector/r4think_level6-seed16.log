Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an fast paced round of TextWorld? You do! Here is how to play! First stop, make an attempt to venture west. With that done, head south. And then, go east. And then, make an attempt to venture east. If you can do that, attempt to move east. After that, lift the coin from the floor of the pantry. And once you've done that, you win!

A rusty sign tells you that you are now in the cubicle. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game and has followed the instructions to go west, then south, then east. Now they're in the Cubicle area. The next step according to the initial instructions was to attempt to move east again. The current location is the Cubicle, and the possible exits are east and west.

The user's next action should be to go east again. The previous steps were moving in the directions mentioned, so continuing with east makes sense. The goal is to lift the coin from the pantry, so maybe after moving east, they'll find the pantry. But according to the current room description, the Cubicle has an exit to the east and west. The user needs to follow the path, so going east again is the next logical step. The response should just be "go east" as per the instructions.

Okay, the user has reached the Pantry room. The original goal was to lift the coin from the pantry. The user needs to pick up the coin here. The previous steps led them here, so the next action should be to pick up the coin. The command should be "take coin" or "lift coin". Since the instruction says "lift the coin from the floor", "lift coin" is more accurate. But in TextWorld, sometimes "take" is used. Wait, the room description says "There is a coin on the floor." So the correct command is "take coin" or "lift coin". Let me check the game's possible commands. Since the user is told to "lift the coin", the correct action is "lift coin". But maybe the game uses "take". However, the user's previous actions were movement commands. The exact command might vary, but "take coin" is more likely. Wait, the user is in the Pantry, and the coin is on the floor. The correct command is "take coin" or "get coin". But the instruction says "lift", so "lift coin" might be correct. However, in many text adventures, "take" is the standard command. Let me think. The user's previous steps were movement, so the next step is to interact with the coin. The correct command here is "take coin". But the user's instruction says "lift the coin from the floor of the pantry. And once you've done that, you win!" So the action is "lift coin". But maybe the game expects "take". Hmm. To be safe, "take coin" is more general. But the user's instruction says "lift", so perhaps "lift coin" is correct. However, in TextWorld, the correct command is "take". Wait, the user is told to "lift the coin", so maybe the game expects "lift". But I'm not sure. Let me check the previous steps. The user was told to "lift the coin from the floor of the pantry. And once you've done that, you win!" So the action is "lift coin". Therefore, the next command should be "lift coin".
