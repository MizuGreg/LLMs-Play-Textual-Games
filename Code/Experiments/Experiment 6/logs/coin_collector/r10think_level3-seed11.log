You are now playing a life changing episode of TextWorld! First of all, attempt to move south. With that done, attempt to go east. And then, retrieve the coin from the floor of the sauna. Alright, thanks!

-= Studio =-
You are in a studio. An usual kind of place. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

>                                                                                                                                -= Studio =-0/1
AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go south
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. A standard one. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the north.



>                                                                                                                                -= Kitchen =-0/2
AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go east
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Sauna =-
If you're wondering why everything seems so standard all of a sudden, it's because you've just shown up in the sauna.



There is an unguarded exit to the west.

There is a coin on the floor.


>                                                                                                                                -= Sauna =-0/3
