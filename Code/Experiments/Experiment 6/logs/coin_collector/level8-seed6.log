Welcome to another profound game of TextWorld! First step, make an attempt to take a trip south. With that done, make an effort to venture east. Once you get around to doing that, go south. And then, go to the east. Then, make an effort to head north. And then, head east. And then, venture east. That done, lift the coin from the floor of the recreation zone. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Closet =-
You are in a closet. You begin looking for stuff.



There is an unblocked exit to the south.

-= Basement =-
You've entered a basement. Let's see what's in here.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked.



>                                                                                                                                -= Basement =-0/2
Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game and has already moved south from the closet into the basement. The current room is the basement, and there are exits to the north and east. The user's previous action was "go south", which took them to the basement.

The user is now asking if they're making the right actions and if they're close to the goal. The goal mentioned earlier was to lift the coin from the recreation zone. So, I need to figure out the correct path based on the hints given in the initial description.

The initial instructions said: after going south, then east, then south again, then east, then north, then east, then east. Then lift the coin. But the user has already gone south once, into the basement. Now, in the basement, the available directions are north and east. 

The next step according to the initial plan was to venture east. So, the user should go east from the basement. That would be the next logical step. The user's next action should be "go east". 

But wait, the user is asking if they're close to the goal. The user might be confused about the path. Let me check the rooms again. The basement has east and north exits. Going east from the basement would take them to another room. The initial plan mentioned going east after the first south. So, the user is on the right track. 

The user's next action should be to go east. So the correct command is "go east".
</think>go east
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Sauna =-
You've just sauntered into a sauna.



You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.



>                                                                                                                                -= Sauna =-0/3

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text adventure game. The goal is to lift the coin from the recreation zone and win. Let me track their movements so far.

They started in the closet, went south to the basement, then east to the sauna. Now, in the sauna, the possible directions are south and west. The original instructions said to go south, then east, then north, then east again, and finally lift the coin. 

Wait, the user has already gone south from the basement to the sauna. The next step in the original plan was to go east again. But in the sauna, the unblocked exits are south and west. The user might need to go west back to the basement, then try another direction. But the original plan said after going south, venture east. Maybe the sauna's east is blocked, so they need to go west first. Alternatively, maybe the recreation zone is in a different area. 

But the user's current location is the sauna. The next action should follow the initial plan: after sauna, go south (but south from sauna is unguarded, maybe leading to another area). Wait, the original steps were: start by going south, then east, then south again, then east again. Maybe the user needs to go south from the sauna. Let me check the current room's description again. In the sauna, the user can go south or west. The original plan says after the sauna, go south. So the next action should be south. But the user's previous steps were in the sauna, so maybe the next step is to go south again. But the user's current position is the sauna, so going south from there would be the next step. Let me confirm the original instructions again. The user was told to go south, then east, then south, then east, then north, then east, then lift the coin. So after the sauna, the next direction is south. So the correct next action is go south.
</think>go south
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Cookhouse =-
You find yourself in a cookhouse. An ordinary kind of place.



There is an unguarded exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded.



>                                                                                                                                -= Cookhouse =-0/4

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game, and they've been moving through different rooms: closet, basement, sauna, now cookhouse. The goal is to lift the coin from the recreation zone and win.

So far, the user has gone south from the closet to the basement, then east to the sauna, then south again to the cookhouse. The next step according to the initial instructions was to go east again. But in the cookhouse, the exits are east and north. The user's last action was going south to the cookhouse. Now, the next action should be east as per the initial plan. But the user might be confused because the directions are a bit tricky. Let me check the current room: Cookhouse has east and north exits. The original plan was after going east in the sauna, then south to cookhouse, then east again. Wait, the initial instructions said: after going south, east, then south again, then east. Then lift the coin. So in the cookhouse, the next step is to go east. But maybe there's a coin here? Or maybe the recreation zone is elsewhere. The user needs to follow the path as instructed. So the next action should be go east from the cookhouse. But the user might not know if that's the right path. However, the user is supposed to follow the initial steps: after the cookhouse, go east. So the answer is go east.

GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Lounge =-
You are in a lounge. An ordinary one. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?



There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.



>                                                                                                                                -= Lounge =-0/5

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game where they have to navigate through different rooms and eventually lift the coin in the recreation zone. The goal is to follow a series of directions: go south, then east, then south again, east again, north, east, east, then lift the coin.

So far, the user has gone from the Closet to the Basement, then East to the Sauna, then South to the Cookhouse, then East to the Lounge. Now they're in the Lounge. The next step according to the initial instructions was to go north from the Lounge. Wait, the user's last action was going east from the Cookhouse to the Lounge. The current room is the Lounge, and the exits are north and west. The original plan was after the Lounge, go north, then east, then east again. But the user needs to check if they're on the right track.

Wait, the original instructions said: after going east from the Cookhouse (which is the Lounge), then go north. Then from there, head east, then east again. Then lift the coin. So in the Lounge, the next step should be north. The user hasn't done that yet. So the next action should be go north. Then, from the next room, they would go east, then east again. Then, in the recreation zone, lift the coin. So the correct next step here is to go north from the Lounge.

GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Workshop =-
You are in a workshop. A typical kind of place.



There is an unguarded exit to the east. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.



>                                                                                                                                -= Workshop =-0/6

Okay, let's see. The user has been moving through different rooms in the game: closet, basement, sauna, cookhouse, lounge, and now the workshop. The original goal was to lift the coin from the recreation zone, which I assume is the lounge since that's where the coin is mentioned.

So far, the user has gone south from the closet, then east, south again, east, north, and now they're in the workshop. The next step according to the initial instructions was to go east again. The workshop has an unguarded exit to the east and a south exit. Since the user is in the workshop, going east would be the next logical step to continue exploring. The goal is to reach the recreation zone (lounge) where the coin is, so moving east from the workshop might lead them back towards the lounge or another area. The user needs to follow the path carefully to find the coin without getting lost. The next action should be to go east.

-= Kitchenette =-
You arrive in a kitchenette.



There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

Okay, let's see. The user has been moving through different rooms in the game, following the instructions given. The goal is to lift the coin from the recreation zone. So far, they've gone through Closet → Basement → Sauna → Cookhouse → Lounge → Workshop → Kitchenette.

Now, in the Kitchenette, the exits are east and west. The previous steps involved moving east and south, but the user needs to find the recreation zone. The coin is in the recreation zone, so maybe the next step is to check if the recreation zone is nearby. But the current room is Kitchenette, which is room 7. The original path required going south, east, north, east, etc. Maybe the recreation zone is in the east or west from here. Since the user is in Kitchenette, they need to check the exits. The next action should be to go east or west. But the user's previous steps have been going east, so maybe the recreation zone is in the east. But the user needs to find the coin, so perhaps the recreation zone is in the west? Wait, the original instruction said to lift the coin from the floor of the recreation zone. So the user needs to reach the recreation zone and then pick up the coin.

Looking at the previous rooms, the user has been moving east and south. The Kitchenette is room 7. The next step would be to check if the recreation zone is in the east or west. The user's last action was going east from the Workshop to the Kitchenette. Now, in the Kitchenette, the exits are east and west. The user should check which direction leads to the recreation zone. Since the user hasn't found the coin yet, they need to continue exploring. The next action could be to go east or west. But the user's previous steps have been going east, so maybe the recreation zone is in the west. Alternatively, maybe the recreation zone is in the east. But the user hasn't found it yet. The user needs to proceed further. The next action should be to go east or west. Since the user is in the Kitchenette, and the exits are east and west, the next step is to choose one. The user's previous steps have been going east, so maybe the correct path is to go east again. But the user needs to check both directions. However, the user's instruction was to go east, then south, then east, etc. Maybe the recreation zone is in the east. But the user hasn't found it yet. The next action should be to go east or west. The user needs to proceed. Since the user is in the Kitchenette, and the exits are east and west, the next step is to go east or west. The user's previous steps have been going east, so maybe the correct path is to go east again. But the user needs to check both directions. However, the user's instructions were to go east, then south, then east, etc. So the next action would be to go east again. But the user is in the Kitchenette, and the east exit is unblocked. So the next action is to go east. But the user might need to check the west as well. However, the user's previous steps have been going east, so maybe the correct path is to go east again. Alternatively, maybe the recreation zone is in the west. But the user hasn't found it yet. The user needs to continue moving. The next action is to go east or west. The user's previous steps have been going east, so the next action is to go east again. But the user might need to check both directions. However, the user's instructions were to go east, then south, then east, etc. So the next action is to go east again. Therefore, the next command is go east.

Well, here we are in the recreation zone. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.



There is an unguarded exit to the west.

There is a coin on the floor.

Okay, let's see. The user has been moving through different rooms in the game, following the instructions given. The goal was to lift the coin from the recreation zone. The user just arrived in the Recreation Zone, where there's a coin on the floor. The next step mentioned in the original instructions was to "lift the coin from the floor of the recreation zone." So the correct action here is to pick up the coin. The user hasn't done that yet, so the next command should be to take the coin. Let me check if there are any other possible steps, but according to the environment description, the coin is on the floor, so the action is straightforward. The user needs to pick it up to win.
