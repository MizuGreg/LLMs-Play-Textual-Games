It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First of all, head south. With that accomplished, make an attempt to travel south. And then, attempt to go west. And then, lift the coin from the floor of the bedchamber. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Sauna =-
You find yourself in a sauna. A standard one.



You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Spare Room =-
You've just walked into a spare room. Let's see what's in here.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and perform specific actions to win. The current room is the Spare Room, and the user has just come from the Sauna by going south. The goal mentioned earlier was to lift the coin from the bedchamber's floor.

First, I need to figure out the correct sequence of actions based on the hints given. The initial instructions said to go south, then try south again, then west, and finally lift the coin. But in the Spare Room, the available directions are north and south. The user has already gone south from the Sauna to enter the Spare Room. Now, the next step according to the initial plan was to attempt to go west, but the current room doesn't have a west direction mentioned. Wait, maybe the user needs to explore the Spare Room first.

Looking at the current room description: the Spare Room has north and south exits. The user is in the Spare Room, and the previous move was going south from the Sauna. So, the next logical step might be to check the other directions available here. But the user's next action was supposed to be west, but that's not possible here. Maybe the path to the bedchamber is through the Spare Room's south exit? Or perhaps there's a hidden item or a different way to proceed.

Wait, the original goal was to lift the coin from the bedchamber's floor. So the user needs to reach the bedchamber. The initial steps were to go south (from Sauna to Spare Room), then south again (from Spare Room to maybe the next room?), then west. But in the Spare Room, going south would take them to another room. Let me check the current room's description again. The Spare Room's south entrance is unguarded, so going south from here would be possible. So the user should go south again from the Spare Room. Then, after that, maybe they can go west as per the initial plan. But the user's next action should be to go south again here. The user's previous action was going south from Sauna to Spare Room, and now they are in the Spare Room. The next step according to the initial plan was to attempt to go south again. So the correct next action is to go south again. Then, after that, they can proceed to go west. But the user's next action is to go south again. So the answer should be "go south".
</think>go south

-= Basement =-
A crooked placard tells you that you are now in the basement.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.



>                                                                                                                                -= Basement =-0/3

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game where they have to navigate through different rooms and eventually lift the coin from the bedchamber. The current room is the basement, and the possible directions are north and west. The previous moves were going south from the sauna to the spare room, then south again to the basement.

The user is asking if they're on the right track and close to the goal. The original instructions mentioned going south, then south again, then west, and lifting the coin. But in the basement, the available directions are north and west. The placard says they're in the basement, so maybe the next step is to go north back to the spare room or west to another area. But the goal is the bedchamber's coin. Maybe the bedchamber is further north or west? Alternatively, perhaps the coin is in the basement, but the user hasn't found it yet. Wait, the original plan was to go west after the basement. But in the basement, west is unguarded. So maybe going west from the basement would lead to the bedchamber? Or maybe the coin is in the basement. But the user hasn't picked it up yet. The original instructions said to lift the coin from the floor of the bedchamber. So the bedchamber is a different room. Maybe the path is: sauna -> spare room -> basement -> bedchamber. So from the basement, going north would take them back to the spare room, but they need to go west from the basement to reach the bedchamber. Wait, the basement's description says west is unguarded. So the next move should be west. But the user is at the basement, and the next action is to go west. Then they would enter another room, maybe the bedchamber. Then lift the coin. So the correct next action is west. But the user's previous action was going south to the basement. Now, in the basement, the options are north or west. The user needs to go west to reach the bedchamber. So the next command should be go west.
</think>go west

-= Bedchamber =-
You arrive in a bedchamber. An ordinary kind of place.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

There is a coin on the floor.

Okay, let me figure out what to do next. The user is in the Bedchamber, which has an exit to the east and a coin on the floor. The original goal mentioned was to lift the coin from the floor of the bedchamber. So the next logical step would be to pick up the coin. The user has been moving through different rooms, and now they're in the bedchamber. The instructions say to only output the action, so the correct command here is "take coin" or "lift coin". Since the game mentions "lift the coin", maybe "lift coin" is the exact command needed. Let me check the previous interactions. The user was told to "lift the coin from the floor of the bedchamber", so the action should be "lift coin". That's the next step.
</think>lift coin

That's not a verb I recognise.

Okay, the user tried to "lift coin" but the game said it's not a recognized verb. Let me check the available actions here. In the Bedchamber, the player is told there's a coin on the floor. The correct action should be to pick up the coin, but maybe the game expects a different command.

Looking at the previous interactions, the user was told to "lift the coin from the floor of the bedchamber." But the game might be using "take" instead of "lift." Alternatively, maybe "get" is the correct verb. Let me think about common commands in text adventures. Usually, "take" or "get" are used for picking up items. Since "lift" didn't work, the next best guess is "take coin" or "get coin." The user might need to use one of these instead. Let me check the game's possible commands again. The user was instructed to "lift the coin," but the game might not recognize that. So the correct command is probably "take coin" or "get coin." I'll go with "take coin" as the next action.
</think>take coin
