Welcome to TextWorld! First thing I need you to do is to take a trip west. With that over with, try to head south. With that over with, go to the east. With that done, make an effort to go to the east. That done, make an attempt to go south. Next, venture east. Then, take a trip north. If you can get around to doing that, pick up the coin from the floor of the study. And if you do that, you're the winner!
