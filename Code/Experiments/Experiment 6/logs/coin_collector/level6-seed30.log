Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First off, go west. After that, try to head north. And then, go west. If you can do that, go to the south. Then, try to travel west. And then, retrieve the coin from the floor of the dish-pit. Got that? Good!
