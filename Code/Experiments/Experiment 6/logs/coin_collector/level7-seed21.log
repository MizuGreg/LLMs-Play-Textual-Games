Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, travel east. Okay, and then, travel north. And then, go north. Once you accomplish that, make an effort to go west. And then, attempt to venture north. With that done, attempt to go east. Following that, recover the coin from the floor of the shower. Alright, thanks!
