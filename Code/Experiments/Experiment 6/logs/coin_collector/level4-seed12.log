Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First, it would be great if you could go to the west. Then, make an attempt to move west. Next, venture west. And then, recover the coin from the floor of the workshop. Got that? Good!

-= Vault =-
You arrive in a vault. A typical one. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."



There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.
