I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! First of all, you could, like, make an attempt to go west. If you can succeed at that, take a trip north. And then, travel east. Then, venture east. Okay, and then, attempt to travel east. Following that, make an attempt to venture north. And then, pick-up the coin from the floor of the cookhouse. And if you do that, you're the winner!
