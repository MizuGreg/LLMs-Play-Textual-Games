Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, you could, like, make an effort to travel south. With that done, take a trip east. Once you finish that, make an attempt to go to the east. Okay, and then, travel east. Then, go south. Then, make an attempt to go to the east. With that accomplished, go to the east. Once you succeed at that, go to the north. Then, attempt to head west. After that, pick up the coin from the floor of the workshop. Alright, thanks!
