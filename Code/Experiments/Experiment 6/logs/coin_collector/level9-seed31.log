Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, try to take a trip north. Next, try to move west. Then, try to go to the north. And then, take a trip west. With that done, try to head north. After that, make an attempt to travel west. And then, go south. Then, move east. That done, recover the coin from the floor of the vault. Alright, thanks!
