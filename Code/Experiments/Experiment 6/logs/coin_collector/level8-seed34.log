Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First thing I need you to do is to make an effort to go to the east. Then, attempt to go to the east. And then, attempt to travel north. After that, travel north. Then, make an effort to head west. Then, move north. After that, try to go east. And then, recover the coin from the floor of the study. Once that's all handled, you can stop!
