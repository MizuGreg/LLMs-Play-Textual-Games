Welcome to TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First thing I need you to do is to try to venture east. Then, recover the coin from the floor of the attic. Alright, thanks!

-= Spare Room =-
Welcome to the spare room.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Attic =-
You've just shown up in an attic. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?



There is an unguarded exit to the west.

There is a coin on the floor.


>                                                                                                                                -= Attic =-0/2
Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Attic now. The goal is to recover the coin from the attic's floor. They already went east from the Spare Room to get here. The Attic has an exit to the west and a coin on the floor.

The user's next step should be to pick up the coin. Since the coin is on the floor, the command would be "pick up coin". But wait, in TextWorld, sometimes you have to use specific verbs. Let me check the possible actions. The user is in the Attic, and the coin is there. So the correct action is to pick it up. Then, after picking it up, they might need to go back west to the Spare Room or maybe there's another exit. But the main task is to recover the coin. So the immediate next action is to pick up the coin.
