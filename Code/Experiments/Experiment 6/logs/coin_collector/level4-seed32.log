Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, make an attempt to take a trip south. With that accomplished, venture west. Next, make an attempt to venture west. Following that, pick-up the coin from the floor of the bedroom. Got that? Good!

-= Sauna =-
You've just walked into a sauna. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.



There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Workshop =-
You arrive in a workshop. A normal kind of place. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

If you're wondering why everything seems so normal all of a sudden, it's because you've just walked into the chamber. You begin looking for stuff.
