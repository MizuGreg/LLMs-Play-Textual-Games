You are now playing a profound game of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to travel east. Okay, and then, travel north. And then, go north. Once you accomplish that, make an effort to go west. And then, attempt to venture north. With that done, attempt to go east. Following that, go to the south. Then, venture west. If you can do that, venture south. And then, go south. That done, attempt to head east. Following that, pick-up the coin from the floor of the closet. Got that? Good!
