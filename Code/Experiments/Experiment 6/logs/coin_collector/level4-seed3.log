Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an life changing round of TextWorld? You do! First step, venture north. And then, take a trip east. Then, move east. After that, retrieve the coin from the floor of the kitchenette. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Shower =-
You find yourself in a shower. An ordinary kind of place. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.



There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Basement =-
A well framed signboard tells you that you are now in the basement. Let's see what's in here.



There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this TextWorld game, and they've been given a series of steps to follow. The initial instructions were to go north, then east twice, get the coin from the kitchenette, and win. So far, they've gone north from the shower into the basement. The basement has exits to east and south.

The user is now asking if they're making the right moves and if they're close to the goal. The assistant needs to decide the next action based on the previous steps. The next step in the original instructions was to take a trip east, then move east again. So after going north to the basement, the next step should be to go east. The user has already gone north once, so the first east would be the second move. Then another east. But the user's current location is the basement, which has an east exit. So the next action should be to go east. The user's previous action was go north, so the next is go east. Then again east. Then retrieve the coin. So the next command is go east.

-= Bedroom =-
Well how about that, you are in the place we're calling the bedroom.



There is an unblocked exit to the east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and complete certain tasks to win. The initial instructions said to go north, then east twice, get a coin from the kitchenette, and then win. 

So far, the user has gone north from the shower into the basement, then east into the bedroom. The current room is the bedroom, and there's an exit to the east and a suggestion to go west. The user is asked if they're on the right track and then to input the next command.

The original plan was to go north, then east, then east again. But after going north once, they were in the basement, then east to the bedroom. The next step according to the original plan would be to go east again from the bedroom. However, the bedroom's description mentions an exit to the east and suggests going west. Maybe the east exit from the bedroom is part of the path to the kitchenette? Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west back to the basement and then find another path.

But the user's goal is to retrieve the coin from the kitchenette. The kitchenette is probably in a different area. The initial steps might have taken them away from the kitchenette. Maybe they need to go back south from the basement to the shower, then north again to the basement, but that seems redundant. Alternatively, perhaps the bedroom's east exit leads to the kitchenette. But the user hasn't found the coin yet, so maybe they need to explore more.

Wait, the original plan was to go north, then east, then east again. The first north took them to the basement. Then east to the bedroom. The next east from the bedroom would be the third move. But the bedroom's description says there's an exit to the east. So maybe that's the next step. However, the hint says to go west from the bedroom. But the user's original plan is to go east twice. So maybe the user is supposed to go east again from the bedroom, even though the hint says to go west. Maybe the hint is a distraction or a red herring. The user needs to follow the original instructions: after the bedroom, go east again. But the problem is that the user is in the bedroom, and the next east might lead to another room. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west back to the basement and then find another path. But the original plan was to go east twice. So perhaps the user should proceed east again, even though the hint says to go west. Maybe the hint is trying to mislead the user. Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go west to the basement, then east again to the kitchenette. But the original plan was to go east twice from the starting point. 

Wait, the original steps were: go north (from shower to basement), then take a trip east (from basement to bedroom), then move east again (from bedroom to another room). So the next step should be east again. The user is in the bedroom, so going east would be the third move. The hint says to go west, but maybe that's a mistake. The user should follow the original plan and go east again. So the next command is go east.

-= Kitchenette =-
Ah, the kitchenette. This is some kind of kitchenette, really great normal vibes in this place, a wonderful normal atmosphere. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.



You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a coin on the floor.

Okay, let's see. The user has been moving through different rooms in the game. The original instructions said to go north, then east twice, get the coin from the kitchenette, and then win. So far, they've gone north from the shower to the basement, then east to the bedroom, then east again to the kitchenette. Now they're in the kitchenette, and there's a coin on the floor.

The next step according to the plan is to retrieve the coin. The user is told to take the coin from the floor of the kitchenette. So the next action should be to pick up the coin. But the game's current prompt says "You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded." But the user is already in the kitchenette, and the coin is on the floor. So the correct action here is to pick up the coin. However, the game might require using a specific command like "take coin" or "get coin". But the initial instructions mentioned "retrieve the coin from the floor", so the command should be to take it. But the user's previous actions were all "go" commands. Maybe the game expects "take coin" here. But the user's previous responses were just the direction commands. Wait, the user's previous actions were "go north", "go east", "go east" again. Now, in the kitchenette, the next step is to pick up the coin. The game's prompt says "There is a coin on the floor." So the correct command here is "take coin" or "get coin". But the user's history shows that they have been using "go" commands. However, in TextWorld, sometimes you need to use "take" or "get" to pick up items. So the next action should be "take coin". But the user's instructions said to "retrieve the coin from the floor of the kitchenette. And once you've done that, you win!" So the correct action here is to take the coin. Therefore, the next command is "take coin".
