It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! First of all, you could, like, head north. With that accomplished, go to the north. Then, make an effort to go north. Then, travel east. And then, make an effort to move north. Once you succeed at that, recover the coin from the floor of the playroom. That's it!

Well, here we are in a salon.



There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game where they have to navigate through different rooms to recover a coin. The current setup seems to be looping between the Salon and Study rooms. The user has been going back and forth between them, which is probably not the most efficient path.

The original instructions mentioned going north from the Salon, then north again, then east, and finally north to reach the playroom where the coin is. But in the current state, the user is stuck in a loop between Salon and Study. The Study room has an exit to the north, but the user is being told to go south instead. Maybe there's a misunderstanding here.

Wait, the user's goal is to get to the playroom's floor to recover the coin. The Study room might be a dead end or part of a different path. The user needs to find the correct path that leads to the playroom. Since the Study room's north exit is unguarded, maybe that's the right direction. But the user is being advised to go south, which would take them back to the Salon. That seems counterproductive.

Alternatively, maybe the Study room has other exits or objects that aren't mentioned. The user hasn't looked for items yet. The coin is on the floor of the playroom, so perhaps the path to the playroom is through the Study room's north exit. But the user is being told to go south, which might be a mistake.

The user is at the Salon again, with the same message. The correct action might be to go north again, as per the initial instructions. But the Study room's north exit is unguarded, so maybe that's the way to go. However, the user is being told to go south, which is confusing. Maybe there's a typo or a miscommunication in the game's prompts.

In any case, the user needs to proceed towards the playroom. The next logical step after the Study room would be to go north again, even if the prompt says to go south. The user might be following the wrong advice. Alternatively, maybe the Study room has a different exit that's not mentioned. But based on the information given, the only exits are north and south.

So, the user should try going north from the Study room again, even if the prompt says to go south. That's the only way to progress towards the playroom. The coin is in the playroom, so the correct path is probably through the Study's north exit. The user needs to follow that path despite the conflicting advice.

You find yourself in a chamber. A standard kind of place.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Chamber now. The previous rooms were Salon, Study, and then Chamber. The goal is to get to the playroom's floor to recover the coin. The user has been moving back and forth between Salon and Study, then into the Chamber.

The Chamber's description says there's an exit to the north and south. The prompt suggests going north since it's unblocked, but also mentions south is unguarded. The user needs to find the right path towards the playroom. 

Earlier, the Study's north exit was unguarded, leading to the Chamber. Now, in the Chamber, the north exit is unblocked. Maybe the playroom is north of the Chamber. The user should try going north again. But the prompt says to try going south if they don't like doors. However, the original plan was to go east after reaching the Study. Maybe the correct path is north from the Chamber. 

The user's previous actions were going back and forth, but the Chamber is a new room. The next step should be to go north from the Chamber to proceed towards the playroom. So the command would be "go north".

Well I'll be, you are in the place we're calling the sauna.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

Well, here we are in the garage. You start to take note of what's in the room.



There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Garage now. The previous rooms were Sauna, then Garage. The goal is to get to the playroom's floor to recover the coin. The user has been moving through different rooms, and now they're in the Garage. The Garage has exits to the north and west.

The original plan was to go north from the Salon, then north again, then east, then north again to reach the playroom. But the path has taken some detours. Now, in the Garage, the user needs to decide between going north or west. The playroom is likely north since the previous room (Sauna) suggested going east, but the Garage's north exit is unblocked. Maybe the playroom is north of the Garage. Alternatively, the west exit might lead to another part of the maze. But since the user's goal is the playroom, going north from the Garage seems more aligned with the original plan. So the next action should be "go north".

-= Playroom =-
I never took you for the sort of person who would show up in a playroom, but I guess I was wrong. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."



There is an unblocked exit to the south.

There is a coin on the floor.
