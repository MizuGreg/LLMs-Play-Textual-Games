Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game and has been moving through different rooms: Office, Cellar, Workshop, Canteen, and now Chamber. The goal is to retrieve a coin from the studio floor. So far, they've gone east, then east again, north, east, and now they're in the Chamber.

The current room is the Chamber. The description says there's an exit to the north (unguarded) and a suggestion to go west. The user's next action needs to follow the previous pattern of moving in specific directions. Let me check the original instructions again.

The original task was: venture east, then travel east, then venture north, travel east, take a trip north, then west, south, west, north, and finally retrieve the coin. But the user has already done some of these steps. Let's track the directions taken so far.

Starting from Office: go east to Cellar, then east to Workshop, north to Canteen, east to Chamber. Now, the next step according to the original plan was after going north (from Canteen to Chamber), then travel east (but they went north from Canteen to Chamber). Wait, maybe the original plan was a sequence of moves: east, east, north, east, north, west, south, west, north, then get the coin.

But in the current state, the user is in the Chamber. The next steps according to the original plan would be after going north (from Canteen to Chamber), then travel east (but they went north from Canteen to Chamber). Wait, maybe the user's path is a bit different. Let me re-examine the steps.

Original instructions: venture east (so go east from Office to Cellar), then travel east (so from Cellar to Workshop), then venture north (from Workshop to Canteen), then travel east (from Canteen to Chamber). Then, take a trip north (from Chamber to north?), but the Chamber's exit is north and west. So maybe the next step is to go north from Chamber. But the user's last action was go east to Chamber. Now, the next step in the original plan was after that, take a trip north. So from Chamber, go north. But the Chamber's description says there's an exit to the north (unguarded) and suggests going west. So the user should go north here.

But the user's next action is to go north. However, the user's last input was "go east" to get to Chamber. The next step according to the original plan is to take a trip north. So the correct action here is to go north. But the user's previous action was go east, so the next step is go north. However, the user might have to check if that's the correct direction. The Chamber's north exit is unguarded, so it's safe. So the next command should be "go north".
