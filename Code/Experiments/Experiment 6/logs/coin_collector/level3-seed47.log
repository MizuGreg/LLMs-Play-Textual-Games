I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! First step, make an attempt to move north. That done, try to travel east. And then, recover the coin from the floor of the study. That's it!

-= Sauna =-
Well I'll be, you are in a place we're calling a sauna.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north.

-= Cubicle =-
Look at you, bigshot, walking into a cubicle like it isn't some huge deal.



There is an unguarded exit to the east. There is an unguarded exit to the south.
