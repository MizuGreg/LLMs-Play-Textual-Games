Welcome to TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First thing I need you to do is to attempt to go to the south. And then, make an attempt to travel west. That done, try to go to the north. Then, make an effort to venture east. With that over with, try to head north. And then, lift the coin from the floor of the kitchen. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Chamber =-
Guess what, you are in a place we're calling a chamber. You start to take note of what's in the room.



There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.
