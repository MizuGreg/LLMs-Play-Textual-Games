I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Lift the coin from the floor of the study.

-= Study =-
You've just walked into a study.





There is a coin on the floor.

That's not a verb I recognise.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

<think>
Okay, the user tried to lift the coin, but the game said that's not a recognized verb. Hmm, maybe the correct command is different. Let me check the possible actions again. The user is in the Study room with a coin on the floor. The original goal was to lift the coin.

Wait, maybe the correct verb is "take" instead of "lift"? In some text adventures, "take" is the standard command. Let me try that. So the next action should be "take the coin". But I need to make sure. The user's previous attempt was "lift the coin", which didn't work. So perhaps the correct command is "take". Let me confirm. Yes, in many TextWorld games, "take" is used for picking up items. So the next step is to use "take the coin".
