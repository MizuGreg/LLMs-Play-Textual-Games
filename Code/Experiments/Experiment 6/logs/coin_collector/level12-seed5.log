Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. Your first objective is to go to the north. And then, go to the east. With that over with, try to head south. After that, make an effort to head east. And then, make an attempt to go north. Then, take a trip west. Then, try to venture south. Then, make an attempt to move south. Following that, take a trip south. That done, travel south. With that over with, head east. Then, lift the coin from the floor of the study. And if you do that, you're the winner!

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game where they have to navigate through different rooms and eventually lift a coin in the study. The current room is the Cookhouse, and the exits mentioned are south and west. The user has been moving between the Chamber and Cookhouse multiple times, going east and west.

The original goal was to go north, then east, south, east, north, west, south, south, then east again, and finally lift the coin. But so far, the user has only managed to go north once, then east and west, but seems stuck in a loop between Chamber and Cookhouse. The current location is the Cookhouse, and the exits are south and west. The user has been going back and forth between east and west, which might not be leading them closer to the study.

The coin is in the study, so the user needs to find a path to the study. The current path seems to be going in circles. Maybe the study is accessible from the Cookhouse via a different exit, but the description only mentions south and west. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to find another path through other rooms. However, the user hasn't found any other exits yet. The challenge is to figure out the correct sequence of moves to reach the study without getting stuck in loops.

Since the user is repeating the same movements, it's possible that the correct path requires moving in a different direction. But based on the current information, the only exits are south and west. The user might need to go south from the Cookhouse, which is unblocked. If they go south, they might reach a different room that leads to the study. Alternatively, maybe the study is accessible through the Chamber, but the user hasn't explored that yet.

The user's next action should be to try moving south from the Cookhouse, as that's the only other exit mentioned. If that leads to a new room, they can continue from there. If not, maybe they need to find another way. But given the current setup, moving south seems like the logical next step.

Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through a series of rooms in a text-based game. Their goal is to eventually lift a coin in the study. So far, they've been moving between the Dish-Pit and Office rooms, going back and forth between them. The current room is the Office, and the exits are north and south.

The user's previous actions have been going north and south repeatedly, which suggests they might be stuck in a loop. The original plan was to go north, then east, south, east, north, west, south, south, then east again, and finally lift the coin. But so far, they've only managed to get through some rooms but are now looping between the Office and Dish-Pit.

The coin is in the study, so the user needs to find a path to the study. The current path doesn't seem to be leading there. Maybe there's another exit they haven't explored yet. However, in the Office, the exits are only north and south. The Dish-Pit has an exit to the north and south as well. Perhaps the study is accessible from another room that's not been mentioned yet, but the user hasn't found it.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to find a different path. Since they've been going back and forth between the Office and Dish-Pit, maybe they need to try a different direction. But according to the current room descriptions, the only exits are north and south. The user might need to continue moving north from the Office to eventually reach the study. However, the previous attempts to go north from the Office just lead back to the Dish-Pit.

Wait, maybe the study is in a different part of the map. The user's initial steps were to go north, then east, but they ended up in the Cookhouse and Chamber. Maybe the study is connected to the Bedroom or another room. But the user hasn't explored those paths yet. However, the current path is stuck in a loop, so perhaps they need to find another way.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east from the Office. But according to the last room description, the Office has an exit to the south and north, not east. So that's not possible. The user might need to find a different route. But given the current information, the only exits are north and south. So the next logical step is to continue moving north from the Office, even though it leads back to the Dish-Pit. Maybe after several loops, they'll find a different exit.

But the user's goal is to lift the coin in the study. Since the study hasn't been mentioned yet, perhaps the user needs to find a different path. However, based on the current room descriptions, the study isn't in the immediate vicinity. Maybe the user needs to go east from the Office, but that's not an option. Alternatively, maybe the study is in the Playroom or another room they've passed through.

Wait, the Playroom had exits to east and south. The user was in the Playroom and went south to the Dish-Pit. Maybe the study is connected to the Playroom's east exit. But the user hasn't tried that. However, the user's last action was going south from the Office to the Dish-Pit. So perhaps they need to go north from the Dish-Pit to the Office again, but that's not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east from the Playroom. But the user hasn't been there in a while. The Playroom was visited earlier, but the user hasn't gone east from there. However, the user's current position is the Office, so they need to find a way to get back to the Playroom. But the only exits from the Office are north and south. So perhaps the user needs to go south from the Office to the Dish-Pit, then east to the Playroom again. But the user hasn't done that yet.

Wait, the user was in the Playroom and went south to the Dish-Pit. Maybe the Playroom's east exit is unblocked. If the user can go east from the Playroom, they might find a new path. But the user is currently in the Office, so they need to get back to the Playroom. That would require going north from the Dish-Pit to the Office, then north again to the Playroom? Wait, no. The Office is north of the Dish-Pit. So from the Dish-Pit, going north leads to the Office. From the Office, going north leads to the Dish-Pit again. So that's a loop.

This suggests that the user is stuck in a loop between the Office and Dish-Pit. Therefore, they need to find another path. But according to the current room descriptions, there's no other exit. Maybe the study is connected to the Playroom's east exit. The user needs to go east from the Playroom. But how to get back to the Playroom?

The user is currently in the Office. To get to the Playroom, they need to go south to the Dish-Pit, then east to the Playroom. Wait, the Playroom had an exit to the east. So from the Dish-Pit, going east would lead to the Playroom. But the user is in the Office, so they need to go south to the Dish-Pit, then east to the Playroom. Then from the Playroom, go east again to maybe the study.

But the user hasn't tried that yet. So the next step would be to go south from the Office to the Dish-Pit, then east to the Playroom, then east again. However, the user is currently in the Office, so their next action should be to go south to the Dish-Pit. But the user just did that, leading to the Dish-Pit again. Then from there, go east to the Playroom. But the user hasn't done that yet.

So the next action should be to go south from the Office to the Dish-Pit, then east to the Playroom. But the user is currently in the Office, so the next command is to go south. However, the user has been doing that repeatedly. But maybe that's the way to get to the Playroom again. Then from the Playroom, go east to find the study.

But the user's goal is to lift the coin in the study. So perhaps the study is connected to the Playroom's east exit. If the user can go east from the Playroom, they might reach the study. Therefore, the next steps would be to go south from the Office to the Dish-Pit, then east to the Playroom, then east again. But the user hasn't done that yet.

So the next action is to go south from the Office to the Dish-Pit. But the user is already there. Wait, the user is in the Office, and the last action was going north, leading back to the Dish-Pit. So the next step is to go south from the Office to the Dish-Pit again. Then from the Dish-Pit, go east to the Playroom. Then from the Playroom, go east to the study. But the user hasn't tried that yet.

Therefore, the next action should be to go south from the Office to the Dish-Pit, then east to the Playroom. But the user is currently in the Office, so the next command is to go south. However, the user has been doing that repeatedly. But maybe that's necessary to get to the Playroom again. So the answer is to go south.
