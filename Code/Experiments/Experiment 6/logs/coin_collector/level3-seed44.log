You are now playing a profound round of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to move north. And then, try to go west. And then, retrieve the coin from the floor of the washroom. Got that? Good!

-= Cookhouse =-
You are in a cookhouse. It seems to be pretty standard here. Let's see what's in here.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north.

AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go north

-= Cubicle =-
You are in a cubicle. An ordinary one.



You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Washroom =-
You are in a washroom. A typical kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's here.



There is an unblocked exit to the east.

There is a coin on the floor.


>                                                                                                                                -= Washroom =-0/3
